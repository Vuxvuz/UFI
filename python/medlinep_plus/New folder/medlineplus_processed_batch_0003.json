Although the channels and transporters are produced normally by the cell, they are unable to function if they are not inserted correctly into the cell membrane. This loss of functional channels and transporters in the heart disrupts the normal flow of ions, which alters the heart's normal rhythm and leads to the heart problems that can be a part of ankyrin-B syndrome.\n\n**More About This Health Condition**\n\n*   **Autism Spectrum Disorder**: MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Autism spectrum disorder\n*   **Ankyrin-B Syndrome**: At least ten mutations in the ANK2 gene have been found to cause ankyrin-B syndrome, a condition characterized by a variety of heart problems.

    "content": "**ANKH Gene**\n\nThe ANKH gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in skeletal development. The ANKH protein plays a role in the development and function of cells that build bones (osteoblasts) and cells that break down bone (osteoclasts). Osteoclasts are involved in bone remodeling, a normal process in which old bone is removed and new bone is created to replace it.\n\nIn addition, the ANKH protein transports a molecule called pyrophosphate out of cells to the intricate network of proteins that forms in the spaces between cells (extracellular matrix). This extracellular pyrophosphate helps regulate bone formation by preventing mineralization, the process by which minerals such as calcium and phosphorus are deposited in tissues. The ANKH protein may have other, unknown functions.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Craniometaphyseal Dysplasia**: More than 10 mutations in the ANKH gene have been found to cause autosomal dominant craniometaphyseal dysplasia, a condition characterized by thickening of bones in the skull (cranium) and widening of a region at the end of long bones known as the metaphysis. Some mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the ANKH protein, whereas others insert or delete one or more amino acids in the protein. These changes disrupt the functioning of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In particular, the maturation (differentiation) of osteoclasts is impaired, which likely disrupts bone remodeling. Reduced breakdown of bone tissue can contribute to the bone thickening characteristic of craniometaphyseal dysplasia. The altered ANKH proteins may also be less able to transport pyrophosphate out of cells. A shortage of extracellular pyrophosphate can increase bone mineralization, which may also contribute to the bone abnormalities.\n\n---\n\n**ANKH Gene**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*Other Disorders*\n\nAt least five mutations in the ANKH gene have been found to cause a rare hereditary form of a cartilage disorder called calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease (CPPDD). CPPDD, also called chondrocalcinosis or pseudogout, is characterized by the accumulation of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals in the cartilage, the tough but flexible tissue that covers the ends of bones at the joints. The buildup of these crystals weakens cartilage and causes it to break down more easily. The crystals may cause inflammation in the joints, which can be painful.\n\nMost cases of CPPDD occur in people older than 40, are not inherited, and have an unknown cause. However, inherited mutations in the ANKH gene have been shown to cause CPPDD in a few families. In these families, one altered copy of the ANKH gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. Individuals with familial CPPDD caused by ANKH gene mutations typically form crystal deposits within multiple joints during early adulthood. Researchers believe that these mutations lead to elevated pyrophosphate levels in the extracellular matrix. High levels of pyrophosphate result in excessive formation of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals within joints.\n\nStudies suggest that certain variations (polymorphisms) in the ANKH gene are associated with the normal differences in bone size and shape among individuals. These polymorphisms probably result in slight changes in the activity of the ANKH protein, affecting the levels of pyrophosphate in the extracellular matrix.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*Craniometaphyseal Dysplasia*\n\nMore than 10 mutations in the ANKH gene have been found to cause autosomal dominant craniometaphyseal dysplasia, a condition characterized by thickening of bones in the skull (cranium) and widening of a region at the end of long bones known as the metaphysis.

    "content": "**ANKRD11 Gene**\n\nThe ANKRD11 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ankyrin repeat domain 11 (ANKRD11). As its name suggests, this protein contains multiple regions called ankyrin domains; proteins with these domains help other proteins interact with each other.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\n*   The ANKRD11 protein interacts with certain proteins called histone deacetylases, which are important for controlling gene activity.\n*   Through these interactions, ANKRD11 affects when genes are turned on and off.\n*   For example, ANKRD11 brings together histone deacetylases and other proteins called p160 coactivators. This association regulates the ability of p160 coactivators to turn on gene activity.\n*   ANKRD11 may also enhance the activity of a protein called p53, which controls the growth and division (proliferation) and the self-destruction (apoptosis) of cells.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nSeveral ANKRD11 gene mutations have been found to cause KBG syndrome, a condition characterized by large upper front teeth and other unusual facial features, skeletal abnormalities, and intellectual disability. Most of these mutations lead to an abnormally short ANKRD11 protein, which likely has little or no function.\n\n**References**\n\n*   The ANKRD11 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ankyrin repeat domain 11 (ANKRD11).\n*   As its name suggests, this protein contains multiple regions called ankyrin domains; proteins with these domains help other proteins interact with each other.\n*   The ANKRD11 protein interacts with certain proteins called histone deacetylases, which are important for controlling gene activity.\n*   Through these interactions, ANKRD11 affects when genes are turned on and off.\n*   For example, ANKRD11 brings together histone deacetylases and other proteins called p160 coactivators.

During embryonic development, ANKRD11 helps regulate the proliferation of these cells and development of the brain. Researchers speculate that the protein may also be involved in the ability of neurons to change and adapt over time (plasticity), which is important for learning and memory. ANKRD11 may function in other cells in the body and appears to be involved in normal bone development.\n\n**KBG Syndrome**\n\nSeveral ANKRD11 gene mutations have been found to cause KBG syndrome, a condition characterized by large upper front teeth and other unusual facial features, skeletal abnormalities, and intellectual disability. Most of these mutations lead to an abnormally short ANKRD11 protein, which likely has little or no function. Reduction of this protein's function is thought to underlie the signs and symptoms of the condition. Because ANKRD11 is thought to play an important role in neurons and brain development, researchers speculate that a partial loss of its function may lead to developmental delay and intellectual disability in KBG syndrome. However, the mechanism is not fully known.\n\n---\n\n**ANKRD11 Gene**\n\n**What is the ANKRD11 gene?**\n\nThe ANKRD11 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 11. This protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell growth and division.\n\n**How does the ANKRD11 gene affect human health?**\n\nMutations in the ANKRD11 gene have been linked to KBG syndrome, a condition characterized by large upper front teeth and other unusual facial features, skeletal abnormalities, and intellectual disability. The mechanism behind this is not fully understood, but researchers speculate that a partial loss of ANKRD11 function may lead to developmental delay and intellectual disability.\n\n**What are the symptoms of KBG syndrome?**\n\nThe symptoms of KBG syndrome include:\n\n* Large upper front teeth\n* Unusual facial features\n* Skeletal abnormalities\n* Intellectual disability\n\n**What is 16q24.3 microdeletion syndrome?**\n\n16q24.3 microdeletion syndrome is a separate disorder that affects the ANKRD11 gene, along with other nearby genes. People with this type of mutation have similar signs and symptoms to those of KBG syndrome, including unusual facial features and intellectual disability.\n\n**Other names for the ANKRD11 gene**\n\nThe ANKRD11 gene has several other names, including:\n\n* ANCO-1\n* ANCO1\n* Ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 11\n* Ankyrin repeat-containing cofactor 1\n* LZ16\n* Nasopharyngeal carcinoma susceptibility protein T13\n\n**Additional information and resources**\n\nFor more information on the ANKRD11 gene, you can consult the following resources:\n\n* Tests listed in the Genetic Testing Registry\n* Scientific articles on PubMed\n* Catalog of genes and diseases from OMIM\n\n---\n\n**ANKRD11 Gene**\n\nThe ANKRD11 gene is located on chromosome 16.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Genes and Gene Therapy\n* Genetic Disorders\n\n**Genomic Location**\n\nThe ANKRD11 gene is found on chromosome 16.\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n* Gallagher D, Voronova A, Zander MA, Cancino GI, Bramall A, Krause MP, Abad C, Tekin M, Neilsen PM, Callen DF, Scherer SW, Keller GM, Kaplan DR, Walz K, Miller FD.

    "content": "**ANO5 Gene**\n\nThe ANO5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called anoctamin-5. While the specific function of this protein is not well understood, it belongs to a family of proteins, called anoctamins, that act as chloride channels.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\n* Chloride channels transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions) in and out of cells.\n* They play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.\n* Most anoctamin proteins function as chloride channels that are turned on (activated) in the presence of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions).\n* Anoctamin proteins are also involved in maintaining the membrane that surrounds cells and repairing the membrane if it gets damaged.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nThe ANO5 gene is associated with certain health conditions, including:\n\n* **Muscular dystrophy**: Mutations in the ANO5 gene have been linked to various forms of muscular dystrophy.\n* **Myopathy**: The ANO5 gene has also been implicated in myopathies, which are muscle disorders.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\nThe ANO5 gene is also known as:\n\n* anoctamin 5\n* ANO5\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on the ANO5 gene, please refer to the following resources:\n\n* National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)\n* Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)\n\n**References**\n\nThe following references provide further information on the ANO5 gene:\n\n* [Insert reference citations]\n\n---\n\n**ANO5 Gene**\n\nThe ANO5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called anoctamin-5. While the specific function of this protein is not well understood, it belongs to a family of proteins, called anoctamins, that act as chloride channels.\n\n**Function of Anoctamin-5 Protein**\n\nAnoctamin-5 protein is most abundant in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For the body to move normally, skeletal muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. The regulation of chloride flow within muscle cells plays a role in controlling muscle contraction and relaxation.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Gnathodiaphyseal Dysplasia**: At least three ANO5 gene mutations have been identified in people with a bone disorder called gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia, which leads to fragile bones, jaw problems, and other skeletal abnormalities.\n* **Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy**: More than 40 mutations in the ANO5 gene have been identified in people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2L. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is a group of related disorders characterized by muscle weakness and wasting, particularly in the shoulders, hips, thighs, and upper arms.\n* **Miyoshi Myopathy**: At least 10 mutations in the ANO5 gene have been found to cause Miyoshi myopathy. When caused by mutations in this gene, the condition is also known as distal anoctaminopathy.\n\n**Relationship Between Mutations and Health Conditions**\n\nThe ANO5 gene mutations that cause gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the anoctamin-5 protein. It is unclear how these mutations lead to the signs and symptoms of gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia, or why they primarily affect bones while other ANO5 gene mutations cause muscle disorders.\n\nThe ANO5 gene mutations identified in people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2L change single amino acids in the anoctamin-5 protein sequence, disrupt how genetic information is pieced together to make a blueprint for producing the protein, or result in a premature stop signal that leads to an abnormally short protein.\n\nThe effects of the loss of anoctamin-5 are unclear. While chloride is necessary for normal muscle function, it is unknown how a lack of this chloride channel causes the signs and symptoms of Miyoshi myopathy.\n\n---\n\n**ANO5 Gene**\n\nThe ANO5 gene plays a crucial role in bone development and growth.\n\n**Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy**\n\n* More than 40 mutations in the ANO5 gene have been identified in people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2L.\n* Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is a group of related disorders characterized by muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy), particularly in the shoulders, hips, thighs, and upper arms.\n* The ANO5 gene mutations identified in people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2L change single amino acids in the anoctamin-5 protein sequence, disrupt how genetic information is pieced together to make a blueprint for producing the protein, or result in a premature stop signal that leads to an abnormally short protein.\n* One of the mutations adds an extra DNA building block (nucleotide) to the ANO5 gene (written as 191dupA) and is believed to be a relatively common cause of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy in people with northern European ancestry.\n\n**Miyoshi Myopathy**\n\n* At least 10 mutations in the ANO5 gene have been found to cause Miyoshi myopathy.\n* When caused by mutations in this gene, the condition is also known as distal anoctaminopathy.\n* Miyoshi myopathy is a muscle disorder that is characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy of muscles that are away from the center of the body (distal muscles), particularly those in the legs.\n* The ANO5 gene mutations identified in people with Miyoshi myopathy change single amino acids in the anoctamin-5 protein or result in the production of an abnormally short protein that is quickly broken down.\n\n**Relationship Between ANO5 Gene Mutations and Muscle Function**\n\n* ANO5 gene mutations that eliminate or impair the role of the anoctamin-5 protein as a chloride channel likely lead to impaired muscle function, resulting in the signs and symptoms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.\n* The effects of the loss of anoctamin-5 are unclear. While chloride is necessary for normal muscle function, it is unknown how a lack of this chloride channel causes the signs and symptoms of Miyoshi myopathy.\n\n---\n\n**ANO5 Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 4/5)**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe ANO5 gene is responsible for producing a protein called anoctamin-5, which plays a crucial role in muscle function. Mutations in the ANO5 gene can lead to various muscular dystrophies, including Miyoshi myopathy and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.\n\n**Production of Abnormally Short Protein**\n\nIndividuals with ANO5 mutations produce an abnormally short protein that is quickly broken down. This results in little or no anoctamin-5 protein being produced.\n\n**Effects of Loss of Anoctamin-5**\n\nThe effects of the loss of anoctamin-5 are unclear. While chloride is necessary for normal muscle function, it is unknown how a lack of this chloride channel causes the signs and symptoms of Miyoshi myopathy.\n\n**Common Cause of Miyoshi Myopathy**\n\nIn individuals of northern European ancestry, the 191dupA mutation that can cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is also a common cause of Miyoshi myopathy. It is not known why the 191dupA mutation can result in different patterns of signs and symptoms.\n\n**Variation of Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy**\n\nMiyoshi myopathy caused by ANO5 gene mutations is likely a variation of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy because it is caused by mutations in the same gene, and in some cases even by the same mutation.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* ANO5_HUMAN\n* anoctamin-5\n* GDD1\n* gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia 1 protein\n* integral membrane protein\n* GDD1\n* LGMD2L\n* TMEM16E\n* transmembrane protein 16E\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n* Gene and Variant Databases\n\n**References**\n\n* Bolduc V, Marlow G, Boycott KM, Saleki K, Inoue H, Kroon J, Itakura M, Robitaille Y, Parent L, Baas F, Mizuta K, Kamata N, Richard I, Linssen WH, Mahjneh I, de Visser M, Bashir R, Brais B.

    "content": "**ANOS1 Gene**\n\nThe ANOS1 gene, also known as KAL1, provides instructions for making a protein called anosmin-1. This protein is involved in development before birth.\n\n* Found in the extracellular matrix\n* Active in many parts of the developing embryo, including:\n\t+ Respiratory tract\n\t+ Kidneys\n\t+ Digestive system\n\t+ Certain regions of the brain\n\nResearchers are working to determine the functions of anosmin-1. They have discovered that, in the developing brain, this protein is involved in:\n\n* The movement (migration) of nerve cells\n* The outgrowth of axons, which are specialized extensions of nerve cells that transmit nerve impulses\n* Regulating contact between nerve cells (cell adhesion)\n\nAnosmin-1 appears to help control the growth and migration of a group of nerve cells that are specialized to process the sense of smell (olfactory neurons). These nerve cells originate in the developing nose and then migrate together to a structure in the front of the brain called the olfactory bulb, which is critical for the perception of odors.\n\nStudies suggest that anosmin-1 is also involved in the migration of neurons that produce a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Like olfactory neurons, GnRH-producing neurons migrate from the developing nose to the front of the brain. GnRH controls the production of several hormones that direct sexual development before birth and during puberty. These hormones are important for the normal function of the ovaries in women and testes in men.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n**ANOS1 Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Developmental Role of Anosmin-1**\n\nAnosmin-1 plays a crucial role in development before birth. It is involved in the movement (migration) of nerve cells and the outgrowth of axons, which are specialized extensions of nerve cells that transmit nerve impulses. The protein also regulates contact between nerve cells (cell adhesion).\n\n**Specific Functions of Anosmin-1**\n\nAnosmin-1 helps control the growth and migration of a group of nerve cells that specialize in processing the sense of smell (olfactory neurons). These nerve cells originate in the developing nose and migrate to the olfactory bulb, which is critical for the perception of odors. Studies suggest that anosmin-1 is also involved in the migration of neurons that produce gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Kallmann Syndrome**: More than 140 mutations in the ANOS1 gene have been identified in people with Kallmann syndrome, a disorder characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and an impaired sense of smell. Researchers estimate that mutations in the ANOS1 gene account for 5 to 10 percent of all cases of Kallmann syndrome.\n\n**Understanding Kallmann Syndrome**\n\nThe ANOS1 gene mutations that cause Kallmann syndrome delete part or all of the gene, change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in anosmin-1, or alter the size of the protein. These mutations disrupt the normal production or function of anosmin-1 during embryonic development.\n\n**Implications of ANOS1 Gene Mutations**\n\nResearchers suspect that the missing or altered protein is unable to direct the migration of olfactory nerve cells and GnRH-producing nerve cells to their usual locations in the developing brain. If olfactory nerve cells do not extend to the olfactory bulb, a person's sense of smell will be impaired.\n\n**Variability in Kallmann Syndrome Features**\n\nIt is unclear how ANOS1 gene mutations lead to other possible signs and symptoms of Kallmann syndrome, including a failure of one kidney to develop (unilateral renal agenesis), hearing loss, and mirror movements of the hands (bimanual synkinesia). Because these features vary among individuals, researchers suspect that other genetic and environmental factors may be involved.\n\n---\n\n**ANOS1 Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 3/4)**\n\n**Category:** general\n\n**Content:**\n\nThe ANOS1 gene plays a crucial role in the development of the brain and reproductive system.

Others are thought to impair the protein's ability to interact with extracellular matrix components. It is unclear what effect these mutations have in cells and tissues.\n\nResearchers suspect that gene mutations disrupt the formation of basement membranes, allowing a hyaline substance to leak through and build up in various body tissues. Alternatively, the mutations could impair the breakdown of excess extracellular matrix proteins, which then accumulate in tissues and lead to the signs and symptoms of hyaline fibromatosis syndrome.\n\n**Variability in Severity**\n\nIt is unclear why the severity of hyaline fibromatosis syndrome varies among affected individuals.

    "content": "**APC Gene**\n\nThe APC gene provides instructions for making the APC protein, which plays a critical role in several cellular processes. The APC protein acts as a tumor suppressor, keeping cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\n*   Helps control how often a cell divides\n*   Regulates how a cell attaches to other cells within a tissue\n*   Determines whether a cell moves within or away from a tissue\n*   Ensures the correct number of chromosomes in a cell following cell division\n\nThe APC protein accomplishes these tasks mainly through association with other proteins, especially those involved in cell attachment and signaling. One such protein is beta-catenin, which helps control gene activity, promotes cell growth and division, and facilitates cell attachment.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Desmoid Tumor**: Several mutations in the APC gene have been found in people with desmoid tumors, a type of aggressive but noncancerous growth. These rare tumors arise from connective tissue and are commonly associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a form of colon cancer.\n\nIn individuals without FAP, APC gene mutations can cause sporadic desmoid tumors. Most such mutations lead to an abnormally short APC protein, which is unable to interact with beta-catenin, resulting in uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation.\n\n---\n\n**Familial Adenomatous Polyposis**\n\nMore than 700 mutations in the APC gene have been identified in families with the classic and attenuated types of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Most of these mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the APC protein. This short protein cannot suppress the cellular overgrowth that leads to the formation of abnormal growths (polyps) in the colon, which can become cancerous.\n\nThe most common mutation in FAP is a deletion of five building blocks of DNA (nucleotides) in the APC gene. This mutation changes the sequence of the building blocks of proteins (amino acids) in the resulting APC protein.\n\nAlthough most people with FAP will develop colorectal cancer, the number of polyps and the time frame in which they become cancerous depend on the location of the mutation in the APC gene. The location of the mutation also determines whether an individual with FAP is predisposed to developing desmoid tumors (described above).\n\n**Primary Macronodular Adrenal Hyperplasia**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Primary macronodular adrenal hyperplasia\n\n**Other Cancers**\n\nMutations in the APC gene are also responsible for a disorder called Turcot syndrome, which is closely related to familial adenomatous polyposis. Turcot syndrome is an association of colorectal cancer with a type of cancerous brain tumor called a medulloblastoma. Approximately two-thirds of people with Turcot syndrome have mutations in the APC gene.\n\nA certain mutation in the APC gene (unrelated to Turcot syndrome) is found in approximately 6 percent of people with Ashkenazi (eastern and central European) Jewish heritage. This mutation replaces the amino acid isoleucine with the amino acid lysine at position 1307 in the APC protein (written as Ile1307Lys or I1307K). This change was initially thought to be harmless, but has been shown to be associated with a 10 percent to 20 percent increased risk of colon cancer.\n\nSomatic mutations in the APC gene may be involved in the development of a small percentage of stomach (gastric) cancers.\n\n---\n\n**APC Gene**\n\nThe APC gene plays a crucial role in the formation of abnormal growths (polyps) in the colon, which can become cancerous.

    "content": "**APOA1 Gene**\n\nThe APOA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). ApoA-I is a component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL).\n\n**Normal Function**\n\n* The APOA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I).\n* ApoA-I attaches to cell membranes and promotes the movement of cholesterol and phospholipids from inside the cell to the outer surface.\n* Once outside the cell, these substances combine with apoA-I to form HDL.\n* ApoA-I also triggers a reaction called cholesterol esterification that converts cholesterol to a form that can be fully integrated into HDL and transported through the bloodstream.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Familial HDL deficiency: Mutations in the APOA1 gene cause familial HDL deficiency, an inherited condition characterized by low levels of HDL in the blood and an elevated risk for early-onset cardiovascular disease.\n* The altered apoA-I protein is less able to promote the removal of cholesterol and phospholipids from cells or stimulate cholesterol esterification, resulting in low HDL levels.\n* A shortage (deficiency) of HDL is believed to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n---\n\n**APOA1 Gene**\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nMutations in the APOA1 gene can also cause a condition called familial visceral amyloidosis, which is characterized by an abnormal accumulation of proteins (amyloidosis) in internal organs (viscera). The mutations that cause this condition alter the apoA-I protein. Abnormal apoA-I proteins stick together to form amyloid deposits that impair the function of the affected organs. The liver, kidneys, and heart are commonly affected by amyloidosis. Depending on the organs involved, the signs and symptoms of the condition vary. Affected individuals can have an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), chronic kidney disease, or a form of heart disease called cardiomyopathy. However, in some people, the condition is very mild and causes no apparent signs or symptoms.\n\n**Familial HDL Deficiency**\n\nMutations in the APOA1 gene cause familial HDL deficiency, an inherited condition characterized by low levels of HDL in the blood and an elevated risk for early-onset cardiovascular disease, which often occurs before age 50. These mutations lead to an altered apoA-I protein. Some versions of the altered protein are less able to promote the removal of cholesterol and phospholipids from cells, which decreases the amount of these substances available to form HDL. Other versions of the altered protein are less able to stimulate cholesterol esterification, which means cholesterol cannot be integrated into HDL particles. Both types of mutation result in low HDL levels. A shortage (deficiency) of HDL is believed to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\napo-AI apoA-I APOA1_HUMAN apolipoprotein A-I\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nTests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n\n* Tests of APOA1\n\nScientific Articles on PubMed:\n\n* PubMed\n\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\n* AMYLOIDOSIS, HEREDITARY SYSTEMIC 2; AMYLD2\n* APOLIPOPROTEIN A-I; APOA1\n\n---\n\n**APOA1 Gene**\n\nThe APOA1 gene is located on chromosome 11 and plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism. Variants of the APOA1 gene have been associated with various disorders, including hereditary systemic amyloidosis type 2 (AMYLD2) and hypoalphalipoproteinemia.\n\n**Scientific Articles**\n\nSeveral studies have investigated the relationship between the APOA1 gene and lipid metabolism.

Each mutation that causes this condition changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in a critical region of apolipoprotein B-100. The altered protein prevents LDLs from effectively attaching to their receptors on the surface of cells, resulting in fewer LDLs being removed from the blood and higher-than-normal blood cholesterol levels.\n\nAs excess cholesterol circulates through the bloodstream, it is deposited abnormally in tissues such as the skin, tendons, and arteries that supply blood to the heart (coronary arteries). A buildup of cholesterol in the walls of coronary arteries greatly increases a person's risk of having a heart attack.\n\nMost people with familial hypercholesterolemia inherit one altered copy of the APOB gene from an affected parent and one normal copy of the gene from the other parent. These cases are associated with an increased risk of early heart disease, typically beginning in a person's forties or fifties. Rarely, a person with familial hypercholesterolemia is born with two mutated copies of the APOB gene, resulting in a more severe form of hypercholesterolemia that usually appears in childhood.\n\n**Familial Hypobetalipoproteinemia**\n\nMore than 120 mutations in the APOB gene have been found to cause familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL), a disorder that impairs the body's ability to absorb and transport fat. Most APOB gene mutations that cause FHBL lead to the production of apolipoprotein B that is abnormally short.\n\nThe severity of the condition largely depends on the length of the abnormal apolipoprotein B. Some mutations in the APOB gene lead to the production of a protein that is shorter than apolipoprotein B-100, but longer than apolipoprotein B-48. In these cases, normal apolipoprotein B-48 is still made in the intestine.\n\nThe normal-length apolipoprotein B-48 can form chylomicrons normally, but the abnormally short apolipoprotein B-100 produced in the liver is less able to produce lipoproteins. Other mutations result in a protein that is shorter than both apolipoprotein B-48 and apolipoprotein B-100.\n\nIn these cases, no normal-length apolipoprotein B protein is produced. The severely shortened protein is not able to form lipoproteins in the liver or the intestine. Generally, if both versions of the protein are shorter than apolipoprotein B-48, the signs and symptoms are more severe than if some normal length apolipoprotein B-48 is produced.\n\nAll of these protein changes lead to a reduction of functional apolipoprotein B. As a result, the transportation of dietary fats and cholesterol is decreased or absent. A decrease in fat transport reduces the body's ability to absorb fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the diet, leading to the signs and symptoms of FHBL.\n\n---\n\n**APOB Gene**\n\nThe APOB gene provides instructions for making a protein called apolipoprotein B, which is necessary for the transportation of dietary fats and cholesterol in the body.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nA decrease in fat transport reduces the body's ability to absorb fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the diet, leading to the signs and symptoms of Familial Hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL).\n\n* **Other Disorders**\n\t+ Researchers are studying other variations (polymorphisms) in the APOB gene that may influence heart disease risk in people without inherited cholesterol disorders.\n\t+ Some studies have found that certain polymorphisms are associated with higher levels of LDLs in the blood and an increased chance of developing or dying of heart disease.\n\t+ Other studies, however, have not shown such an association.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* apoB-100\n* apoB-48\n* APOB_HUMAN\n* apolipoprotein B (including Ag(x) antigen)\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* **Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry**\n\t+ Tests of APOB\n* **Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\t+ PubMed\n* **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\t+ APOLIPOPROTEIN B; APOB\n* **Gene and Variant Databases**\n\t+ NCBI Gene\n\t+ ClinVar\n\n**References**\n\n* Benn M, Nordestgaard BG, Jensen JS, Grande P, Sillesen H, Tybjaerg-Hansen A.

    "content": "**APOE Gene**\n\nThe APOE gene provides instructions for making a protein called apolipoprotein E. This protein combines with fats (lipids) in the body to form molecules called lipoproteins. Lipoproteins are responsible for packaging cholesterol and other fats and carrying them through the bloodstream. Maintaining normal levels of cholesterol is essential for the prevention of disorders that affect the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular diseases), including heart attack and stroke.\n\nThere are at least three slightly different versions (alleles) of the APOE gene. The major alleles are called e2, e3, and e4. The most common allele is e3, which is found in more than half of the general population.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Alzheimer's Disease**\n    *   The e4 version of the APOE gene increases an individual's risk for developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease.\n    *   People who inherit one copy of the APOE e4 allele have an increased chance of developing the disease; those who inherit two copies of the allele are at even greater risk.\n    *   The APOE e4 allele may also be associated with an earlier onset of memory loss and other symptoms compared to individuals with Alzheimer's disease who do not have this allele.\n*   **Age-related Hearing Loss**\n    *   MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Age-related hearing loss\n*   **Age-related Macular Degeneration**\n    *   MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Age-related macular degeneration\n*   **Dementia with Lewy Bodies**\n    *   The e4 version of the APOE gene can increase the risk of developing a form of dementia called dementia with Lewy bodies.\n    *   People who inherit one copy of the APOE e4 allele have an increased chance of developing dementia with Lewy bodies.\n\n---\n\n**APOE Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/5)**\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nVariants of apolipoprotein E have been studied extensively as risk factors for many different conditions. For example, APOE alleles have been shown to influence the risk of cardiovascular diseases. People who carry at least one copy of the APOE e4 allele have an increased chance of developing atherosclerosis, which is an accumulation of fatty deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries. This progressive narrowing of the arteries increases the risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\nThe APOE e2 allele has been shown to greatly increase the risk of a rare condition called hyperlipoproteinemia type III. Most people with this disorder have two copies of the APOE e2 allele, leading researchers to conclude that the e2 allele plays a critical role in the development of the condition. Hyperlipoproteinemia type III is characterized by increased blood levels of cholesterol, certain fats called triglycerides, and molecules called beta-very low-density lipoproteins (beta-VLDLs), which carry cholesterol and lipoproteins in the bloodstream. A buildup of cholesterol and other fatty materials can lead to the formation of small, yellow skin growths called xanthomas and the development of atherosclerosis.\n\n**Alzheimer's Disease**\n\nThe e4 version of the APOE gene increases an individual's risk for developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative disease of the brain that causes dementia, which is a gradual loss of memory, judgment, and ability to function. The late-onset form of the condition occurs in people older than age 65. People who inherit one copy of the APOE e4 allele have an increased chance of developing the disease; those who inherit two copies of the allele are at even greater risk.\n\nThe APOE e4 allele may also be associated with an earlier onset of memory loss and other symptoms compared to individuals with Alzheimer's disease who do not have this allele. It is not known how the APOE e4 allele is related to the risk of Alzheimer's disease. However, researchers have found that this allele is associated with an increased number of protein clumps, called amyloid plaques, in the brain tissue of affected people. A buildup of amyloid plaques may lead to the death of nerve cells (neurons) and the progressive signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIt is important to note that people with the APOE e4 allele inherit an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, not the disease itself. Not all people with Alzheimer's disease have the APOE e4 allele, and not all people who have this allele will develop the disease.\n\n**Age-related Hearing Loss**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Age-related hearing loss\n\n**Age-related Macular Degeneration**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Age-related macular degeneration\n\n**Dementia with Lewy Bodies**\n\nThe e4 version of the APOE gene can increase the risk of developing a form of dementia called dementia with Lewy bodies; however, some people with the APOE e4 allele never develop this condition. Dementia with Lewy bodies is characterized by intellectual decline; visual hallucinations; sudden changes in attention and mood; and movement problems characteristic of Parkinson's disease such as rigidity of limbs, tremors, and impaired balance and coordination.\n\nPeople who inherit one copy of the APOE e4 allele have an increased chance of developing dementia with Lewy bodies. It is unclear how the APOE e4 allele contributes to the development of this condition. It is thought that the apolipoprotein E produced from the e4 allele of the APOE gene may disrupt the transport of a protein called alpha-synuclein into and out of cells. When alpha-synuclein is trapped inside or outside of cells, it accumulates in clusters, creating Lewy bodies. Accumulation of these clusters throughout the brain impairs neuron function and ultimately causes cell death.\n\n---\n\n**APOE Gene**\n\n**Dementia with Lewy Bodies**\n\nThe e4 version of the APOE gene can increase the risk of developing a form of dementia called dementia with Lewy bodies.

Over time, the loss of neurons increasingly impairs intellectual and motor function and the regulation of emotions, resulting in the signs and symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies.\n\nIt is unclear why some people with the APOE e4 allele develop Alzheimer's disease while others develop dementia with Lewy bodies.\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nVariants of apolipoprotein E have been studied extensively as risk factors for many different conditions. For example, APOE alleles have been shown to influence the risk of cardiovascular diseases. People who carry at least one copy of the APOE e4 allele have an increased chance of developing atherosclerosis, which is an accumulation of fatty deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries.\n\nThis progressive narrowing of the arteries increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. The APOE e2 allele has been shown to greatly increase the risk of a rare condition called hyperlipoproteinemia type III. Most people with this disorder have two copies of the APOE e2 allele, leading researchers to conclude that the e2 allele plays a critical role in the development of the condition.\n\nHyperlipoproteinemia type III is characterized by increased blood levels of cholesterol, certain fats called triglycerides, and molecules called beta-very low-density lipoproteins (beta-VLDLs), which carry cholesterol and lipoproteins in the bloodstream. A buildup of cholesterol and other fatty materials can lead to the formation of small, yellow skin growths called xanthomas and the development of atherosclerosis.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\nApo-E, APOE_HUMAN, Apolipoproteins E\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nTests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n\n* Tests of APOE\n\nScientific Articles on PubMed:\n\n* PubMed\n\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\n* APOLIPOPROTEIN E; APOE\n\n---\n\n**APOE Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 4/5)**\n\n**Tests of APOE**\n\n*   **Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n    *   PubMed\n*   **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n    *   APOLIPOPROTEIN E; APOE\n*   **Gene and Variant Databases**\n    *   NCBI Gene\n    *   ClinVar\n\n**Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry**\n\n*   Tests of APOE\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   PubMed\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   APOLIPOPROTEIN E; APOE\n\n**Gene and Variant Databases**\n\n*   NCBI Gene\n*   ClinVar\n\n---\n\n**APOE Gene**\n\nThe APOE gene is found on chromosome 19.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Genes and Gene Therapy\n* Genetic Disorders\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n* What is DNA?\n* What is a gene?\n* What is a gene variant and how do variants occur?\n\n**Genetic Disorders**\n\nAlzheimer's disease has been linked to the APOE gene.

    "content": "**APP Gene**\n\nThe APP gene provides instructions for making a protein called amyloid precursor protein. This protein is found in many tissues and organs, including the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). Little is known about the function of amyloid precursor protein. Researchers speculate that it may bind to other proteins on the surface of cells or help cells attach to one another. Studies suggest that in the brain, it helps direct the movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons) during early development.\n\nAmyloid precursor protein is cut by enzymes to create smaller fragments (peptides), some of which are released outside the cell. Two of these fragments are called soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) and amyloid beta (β) peptide. Recent evidence suggests that sAPP has growth-promoting properties and may play a role in the formation of neurons in the brain both before and after birth. The sAPP peptide may also control the function of certain other proteins by turning off (inhibiting) their activity. Amyloid β peptide is likely involved in the ability of neurons to change and adapt over time (plasticity). Other functions of sAPP and amyloid β peptide are under investigation.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nMany variants (also called mutations) in the APP gene can cause early-onset Alzheimer's disease, which begins before age 65. These variants are responsible for less than 10 percent of all early-onset cases of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe most common APP gene variant changes one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) in the amyloid precursor protein. This variant replaces the amino acid valine with the amino acid isoleucine at protein position 717 (written as Val717Ile or V717I). Variants in the APP gene can lead to an increased amount of the amyloid β peptide or to the production of a slightly longer and stickier form of the peptide. When these protein fragments are released from the cell, they can accumulate in the brain and form clumps called amyloid plaques. These plaques are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. A buildup of toxic amyloid β peptide and amyloid plaques may lead to the death of neurons and the progressive signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* Amyloid beta precursor protein\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* National Institute on Aging: Alzheimer's Disease\n* Alzheimer's Association: Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease\n\n---\n\n**APP Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Hereditary Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy**\n    Variants in the APP gene have been found to cause hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a condition characterized by stroke and a decline in intellectual function (dementia), which begins in mid-adulthood. These variants change single amino acids in the amyloid precursor protein. Each of these variants causes a different type of the condition.\n\n    The Dutch type, the most common of all the types, is caused by the replacement of the amino acid glutamic acid with the amino acid glutamine at position 22 in the protein sequence (written as Glu22Gln or E22Q). The Italian type and Arctic type are also caused by changes to glutamic acid at position 22. In the Italian type, glutamic acid is replaced with the amino acid lysine (written as Glu22Lys or E22K) and in the Arctic type, glutamic acid is replaced with the amino acid glycine (written as Glu22Gly or E22G). The Flemish type is caused by replacement of the amino acid alanine with glycine at position 21 (written as Ala21Gly or A21G). In the Iowa type, the amino acid aspartic acid is switched with the amino acid asparagine at position 23 (written as Asp23Asn or D23N). The Piedmont type of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy is caused by the replacement of the amino acid leucine at position 34 with the amino acid valine (written as Leu34Val or L34V).\n\n    The result of all of these variants is the production of an amyloid β peptide that is more prone to cluster together (aggregate) than the normal peptide. The aggregated protein forms amyloid deposits that accumulate in the blood vessels of the brain. The amyloid deposits replace the muscle fibers and elastic fibers that give blood vessels flexibility, causing the blood vessels to become weak and prone to breakage. In the brain, such a break causes bleeding (hemorrhagic stroke), which can lead to brain damage and dementia or be life-threatening. Amyloid deposits in specific parts of the brain can interfere with normal brain function, leading to dementia, seizures, movement problems, and other neurological features in some people with hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Alzheimer's Disease**\n    Many variants (also called mutations) in the APP gene can cause early-onset Alzheimer's disease, which begins before age 65.

    "content": "**AQP2 Gene**\n\nThe AQP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called aquaporin 2. This protein forms a channel that carries water molecules across cell membranes.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe aquaporin 2 water channel plays an essential role in maintaining the body's water balance. The placement of these channels is controlled by a hormone called arginine vasopressin (AVP), which is sometimes also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH). When a person's fluid intake is low or when a lot of fluid is lost, AVP is released from the brain, where it is produced and stored. This hormone triggers chemical reactions that ultimately insert aquaporin 2 water channels into the membrane of collecting duct cells. These channels allow water to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream, which makes the urine more concentrated.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nMultiple variants in the AQP2 gene have been identified in people with arginine vasopressin resistance. People with this condition produce an excessive amount of urine (polyuria), which depletes the amount of water in the body. This water loss also leads to excessive thirst (polydipsia). Most of the AQP2 gene variants that cause this condition produce an aquaporin 2 protein that is folded incorrectly.

Androgen receptors allow the body to respond appropriately to these hormones.\n\n*   The receptors are present in many of the body's tissues, where they attach (bind) to androgens.\n*   The resulting androgen-receptor complex then binds to DNA and regulates the activity of certain genes that play a role in male sexual development.\n*   By turning the genes on or off as necessary, the androgen receptor complex helps direct the development of male sex characteristics.\n*   Androgens and androgen receptors also have other important functions in both males and females, such as regulating hair growth and sex drive.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nHundreds of different variants (also called mutations) in the AR gene have been identified in people with androgen insensitivity syndrome, a condition that affects sexual development before birth and during puberty. Most of these variants are changes in single DNA building blocks (base pairs). Other variants insert or delete multiple base pairs in the gene. Some variants lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the androgen receptor protein, while others cause the production of an abnormal receptor that cannot bind to androgens or to DNA.\n\n*   As a result of these changes, androgen receptors do not work properly, which makes them less able to bind to androgens and regulate gene activity.\n*   If androgen receptors cannot bind to androgens, the body cannot use androgens, even if there are normal levels of these hormones in the body.\n\nThere are three forms of androgen insensitivity syndrome: complete, partial, and mild. Which form a person has depends on how much the variants affect the function of the androgen receptor. Variants that produce nonfunctional versions of the androgen receptor cause complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, while variants that reduce but do not eliminate the receptor's activity can cause partial or mild androgen insensitivity syndrome.\n\n*   People with this condition have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each cell.\n*   Depending on the level of androgen insensitivity, affected individuals may have external sex characteristics that are typical for females or typical for males, or they may have features of both male and female sexual development.\n\n---\n\n**AR Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/5)**\n\n*   **Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy**\n    Variants in the AR gene have been found to cause spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. This condition affects specialized nerve cells that control muscle movement (motor neurons). The AR gene variants that cause spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy are an expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the AR gene. Instead of the typical 10 to 36 repeats, CAG is repeated from 38 to more than 60 times in people with this disorder.\n*   **Androgenetic Alopecia**\n    Variants in the AR gene are associated with an increased risk of androgenetic alopecia, a form of hair loss also known as male pattern baldness in men and female pattern hair loss in women. The variants change the number or order of base pairs that make up the AR gene.\n*   **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome**\n    MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Polycystic ovary syndrome\n*   **Prostate Cancer**\n    MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Prostate cancer\n*   **Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome**\n    Hundreds of different variants (also called mutations) in the AR gene have been identified in people with androgen insensitivity syndrome, a condition that affects sexual development before birth and during puberty.

This condition affects specialized nerve cells that control muscle movement (motor neurons). The AR gene variants that cause spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy are an expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the AR gene. Instead of the typical 10 to 36 repeats, CAG is repeated from 38 to more than 60 times in people with this disorder.\n\nAlthough the extended CAG region changes the structure of the androgen receptor, it is unclear how the altered protein damages nerve cells. Researchers believe that a fragment of the androgen receptor protein that contains the CAG repeats accumulates within these cells and interferes with normal cell functions. This buildup leads to the gradual loss of motor neurons, which results in muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy).\n\n**Androgenetic Alopecia**\n\nVariants in the AR gene are associated with an increased risk of androgenetic alopecia, a form of hair loss also known as male pattern baldness in men and female pattern hair loss in women. The variants change the number or order of base pairs that make up the AR gene. These genetic changes appear to be most frequent in men with hair loss that begins at an early age.\n\nResearchers believe that AR gene variants may increase the activity of androgen receptors in the scalp. Although androgenetic alopecia is related to the effects of androgens on hair growth, it remains unclear how changes in the AR gene increase the risk of hair loss in people with this condition.\n\n**Polycystic Ovary Syndrome**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Polycystic ovary syndrome\n\n**Prostate Cancer**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Prostate cancer\n\n---\n\n**AR Gene**\n\n**Genomic Location**\nThe AR gene is found on the X chromosome.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Genes and Gene Therapy\n* Genetic Disorders\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n* Adachi H, Katsuno M, Minamiyama M, Waza M, Sang C, Nakagomi Y, Kobayashi Y, Tanaka F, Doyu M, Inukai A, Yoshida M, Hashizume Y, Sobue G.

This reaction activates an ADP-ribosylation factor, a molecule that is involved in vesicle trafficking.

    "content": "**ARG1 Gene**\n\nThe ARG1 gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme arginase. This enzyme participates in the urea cycle, a series of reactions that occurs in liver cells.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe urea cycle processes excess nitrogen, which is generated when proteins and their building blocks (amino acids) are used by the body. The urea cycle produces a compound called urea from excess nitrogen. Urea is then excreted by the kidneys. Excreting the excess nitrogen prevents it from accumulating in the form of ammonia, which is toxic.\n\nArginase facilitates the last step of the urea cycle, a reaction in which nitrogen is removed from the amino acid arginine and processed into urea. A compound called ornithine is also produced during this reaction; it is needed for the urea cycle to repeat.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nMany variants (also called mutations) have been identified in the ARG1 gene. Arginase deficiency causes ammonia to accumulate gradually in the blood. The nervous system is especially sensitive to the effects of excess ammonia. Changes in the ARG1 gene can result in an arginase enzyme that is unstable, shorter than usual, or the wrong shape. Variants in the ARG1 gene may also prevent the enzyme from being produced at all.\n\nThe shape of an enzyme affects its ability to control a chemical reaction. If the arginase enzyme is misshapen or missing, it cannot fulfill its role in the urea cycle. Excess nitrogen is not converted to urea for excretion, and ammonia and arginine accumulate in the body.

GAPs turn off (inactivate) proteins called GTPases, which play an important role in chemical signaling within cells. Often referred to as molecular switches, GTPases can be turned on and off.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe ARHGAP31 protein inactivates GTPases known as Cdc42 and Rac1 by stimulating a reaction that turns the attached GTP into GDP. When active, Cdc42 and Rac1 transmit signals that are critical for various aspects of embryonic development. The ARHGAP31 protein appears to regulate these GTPases specifically during development of the limbs, skull, and heart.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Adams-Oliver Syndrome**: At least three mutations in the ARHGAP31 gene are known to cause Adams-Oliver syndrome, a condition characterized by areas of missing skin (aplasia cutis congenita), usually on the scalp, and malformations of the hands and feet. These mutations lead to production of an abnormally short ARHGAP31 protein that is more active than normal.

The mechanism by which variants in the ARID1A gene contribute to cancer is unknown, although it is thought that changes in SWI/SNF complexes are involved. These changes may impair normal cell differentiation, which leads to the overgrowth of certain cell types, causing cancer.

    "content": "**ARMC5 Gene**\n\nThe ARMC5 gene provides instructions for making a protein about which little is known. It is found mainly in the fluid surrounding the cell nucleus (cytoplasm), and studies suggest that its function depends on interacting with other proteins. It is thought to act as a tumor suppressor, which means that it helps to prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Primary Macronodular Adrenal Hyperplasia (PMAH)**: At least 24 mutations in the ARMC5 gene have been identified in people with PMAH, a disorder that causes multiple lumps (nodules) to form in the adrenal glands. These nodules cause adrenal gland enlargement (hyperplasia) and result in production of higher-than-normal levels of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol normally helps maintain blood sugar (glucose) levels, protects the body from physical stress, and suppresses inflammation. Increased cortisol levels can lead to weight gain in the face and upper body, fragile skin, bone loss, fatigue, and other health problems.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* None\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* More information on primary macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PMAH) can be found at [insert link].\n\n**References**\n\n* [Insert references]\n\n---\n\n**ARMC5 Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n**Category:** general\n\n**Primary Macronodular Adrenal Hyperplasia (PMAH)**\n\nPMAH is a disorder that causes multiple lumps (nodules) to form in the adrenal glands, leading to their enlargement and increased production of cortisol. This hormone helps maintain blood sugar levels, protects against physical stress, and suppresses inflammation. However, elevated cortisol levels can result in weight gain, fragile skin, bone loss, fatigue, and other health issues.\n\n**Inheritance and Development**\n\nPeople with PMAH caused by ARMC5 gene mutations inherit one copy of the mutated gene in each cell. The condition develops only when affected individuals acquire a second mutation in the other copy of the ARMC5 gene in certain cells of the adrenal glands. This second mutation is somatic, meaning it's acquired during a person's lifetime and present only in specific cells.\n\n**Reduced Penetrance**\n\nSome individuals who have inherited the altered ARMC5 gene never develop PMAH due to reduced penetrance. This occurs because the condition requires both inherited and somatic mutations for its manifestation.\n\n**ARMC5 Gene Mutations**\n\nThe ARMC5 gene mutations that cause PMAH are thought to impair the protein's tumor suppressor function, allowing the overgrowth of certain cells. It is unclear why this overgrowth is limited to the adrenal glands in people with PMAH.\n\n*\\*Other Names for This Gene\\*\\*\n\n• FLJ13063\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on ARMC5 gene mutations and their relationship to PMAH, consult the following resources:\n\n• Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry\n• Scientific Articles on PubMed\n• Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n• Gene and Variant Databases (NCBI Gene, ClinVar)\n\n**References**\n\n1.

This region has been strongly associated with the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration, a common cause of vision loss in older adults. Researchers have identified several variations (polymorphisms) in and near the ARMS2 gene that may explain the association between the 10q26 region and age-related macular degeneration.\n\n    The best-studied of these variations, known as rs10490924, alters a single protein building block (amino acid) in the ARMS2 protein. Another common variation, a complex change that deletes a segment of the ARMS2 gene and inserts new genetic material, may also contribute to disease risk.\n\n    It is unclear how polymorphisms in the ARMS2 gene might be related to age-related macular degeneration. In the 10q26 region, the ARMS2 gene is located next to a gene called HTRA1; changes in this gene have also been studied as a risk factor for the disease.\n\n    Because the two genes are so close together, it is difficult to tell whether changes in one gene or the other, or possibly changes in both genes, account for the increased disease risk.

It is not clear why mutations in the ARX gene cause this array of conditions; researchers suggest that other genetic and environmental factors that have not been identified are likely involved.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n*   **Aristaless-related homeobox**\n*   **X-linked ARX_HUMAN ISSX MRX29 MRX32 MRX33 MRX36 MRX38 MRX43 MRX54 MRXS1 PRTS**\n\n**References**\n\nThe following scientific articles provide more information on the ARX gene and its associated conditions:\n\n*   Abedini SS, Kahrizi K, Behjati F, Banihashemi S, Ghasemi Firoozabadi S, Najmabadi H.

    "content": "**ASAH1 Gene**\n\nThe ASAH1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called acid ceramidase. This enzyme is found in lysosomes, which are cell compartments that digest and recycle materials.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nWithin lysosomes, acid ceramidase breaks down fats (lipids) called ceramides. Ceramides play a role in regulating:\n\n* Cell maturation (differentiation)\n* Growth and division of cells (proliferation)\n* Controlled cell death (apoptosis)\n\nCeramides are also a component of myelin, which insulates and protects nerve cells.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nVariants in the ASAH1 gene have been found to cause Farber lipogranulomatosis. This condition is characterized by the buildup of ceramides and other fats in cells throughout the body, particularly around the joints.\n\nThe variants associated with Farber lipogranulomatosis change a single protein building block (amino acid) in acid ceramidase, severely reducing its activity to less than one-tenth of normal. As a result, the enzyme cannot break down ceramides properly, and they build up in the lysosomes of various cells.\n\nDamage to the affected cells leads to the voice, skin, and joint problems that are characteristic of Farber lipogranulomatosis.\n\n---\n\n**ASAH1 Gene**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Spinal Muscular Atrophy with Progressive Myoclonic Epilepsy**\n    Variants in the ASAH1 gene have been found to cause spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (SMA-PME). This condition is characterized by muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) and a combination of seizures and uncontrollable muscle jerks (myoclonic epilepsy) that begin in childhood. The ASAH1 gene variants that cause SMA-PME result in a reduction of acid ceramidase activity to a level less than one-third of normal.\n*   **Farber Lipogranulomatosis**\n    Variants (also known as mutations) in the ASAH1 gene have been found to cause Farber lipogranulomatosis. This condition is characterized by the buildup of ceramides and other fats in cells throughout the body, particularly around the joints. Most of the variants associated with Farber lipogranulomatosis change a single protein building block (amino acid) in acid ceramidase, which severely reduces the activity of the enzyme, typically to less than one-tenth of normal.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**More About This Health Condition**\n\n*   **Farber Lipogranulomatosis**\n    Variants (also known as mutations) in the ASAH1 gene have been found to cause Farber lipogranulomatosis.

This process helps maintain the balance of ceramides and their breakdown products, sphingosine and fatty acids.\n\n**What is spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (SMA-PME)?**\n\nSMA-PME is a rare genetic disorder characterized by muscle jerks (myoclonic epilepsy) that begin in childhood. The ASAH1 gene variants that cause SMA-PME result in a reduction of acid ceramidase activity to a level less than one-third of normal.\n\n**How does the reduction of acid ceramidase activity affect the body?**\n\nThe decrease in acid ceramidase activity leads to inefficient breakdown of ceramides and impaired production of its breakdown products sphingosine and fatty acids. The increase in ceramides and reduction in sphingosine and fatty acids likely play a role in the development of the features of SMA-PME, but the exact mechanism is unknown.\n\n**What is Farber lipogranulomatosis?**\n\nFarber lipogranulomatosis is another condition characterized by a reduction in acid ceramidase activity. However, the effects of the enzyme changes in SMA-PME are still unclear due to its rarity.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* AC\n* ACDase\n* acylsphingosine deacylase\n* ASAH\n* ASAH1_HUMAN\n* FLJ21558\n* FLJ22079\n* N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase (acid ceramidase) 1\n* PHP\n* PHP32\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n\t+ Tests of ASAH1\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n\t+ PubMed\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ N-ACYLSPHINGOSINE AMIDOHYDROLASE 1; ASAH1\n* Gene and Variant Databases:\n\t+ NCBI Gene\n\t+ ClinVar\n\n**References**\n\n* Alayoubi AM, Wang JC, Au BC, Carpentier S, Garcia V, Dworski S, El-Ghamrasni S, Kirouac KN, Exertier MJ, Xiong ZJ, Prive GG, Simonaro CM, Casas J, Fabrias G, Schuchman EH, Turner PV, Hakem R, Levade T, Medin JA.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/ash1l/",
    "content": "**ASH1L Gene**\n\nThe ASH1L gene, also known as KMT2H, provides instructions for making an enzyme called lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H. This enzyme is found in many organs and tissues of the body and functions as a histone methyltransferase.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nHistone methyltransferases are enzymes that modify proteins called histones. Histones are structural proteins that attach to DNA and give chromosomes their shape. By adding a molecule called a methyl group to histones, histone methyltransferases control the activity of certain genes. Lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H appears to turn on certain genes that are especially important for development of the brain.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Autism Spectrum Disorder**: At least seven ASH1L gene mutations have been identified in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These mutations change one building block (amino acid) in the lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H enzyme, delete genetic material in the ASH1L gene sequence, or result in a premature stop signal. As a result of these mutations, the enzyme is nonfunctional, disrupting histone methylation and affecting brain development.\n\nNote: I removed the repetitive text at the end of each section and reformatted the content to make it easier to read. I also bolded the heading as per your request.\n\n---\n\n**ASH1L Gene**\n\nThe ASH1L gene is associated with an increased risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Individuals with ASD may exhibit social skills deficits, communication problems, and repetitive behaviors.\n\n**Gene Function**\n\nThe ASH1L gene encodes a lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H enzyme. Some mutations associated with ASD change one amino acid in the enzyme, while others delete genetic material or result in a premature stop signal, leading to an abnormally short enzyme. As a result of these mutations, the enzyme is nonfunctional.\n\n**Impact on Brain Development**\n\nA lack of functional lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H enzyme disrupts histone methylation, affecting brain development and increasing the risk of ASD.

    "content": "**ASL Gene**\n\nThe ASL gene provides instructions for making the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase. This enzyme primarily participates in the urea cycle, a series of reactions that occur in liver cells.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe urea cycle processes excess nitrogen, generated when protein is used by the body, to make a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys. Excreting the excess nitrogen prevents it from accumulating in the form of ammonia.\n\nThe specific role of the argininosuccinate lyase enzyme is to start the reaction in which the amino acid arginine, a building block of proteins, is produced from argininosuccinate, the molecule that carries the waste nitrogen collected earlier in the urea cycle. The arginine is later broken down into urea, which is excreted, and ornithine, which restarts the urea cycle.\n\nIn cells throughout the body, the argininosuccinate lyase enzyme is also involved in moving (transporting) arginine into cells to make a compound called nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is important for regulating blood flow and blood pressure.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Argininosuccinic aciduria: More than 130 mutations in the ASL gene have been found to cause this condition. In some cases, a short sequence of DNA is deleted from the gene. Other mutations replace one protein building block (amino acid) with another amino acid in the argininosuccinate lyase enzyme. In people of Arab ancestry, two common mutations replace the amino acid glutamine with a premature stop signal at position 116 or position 354 in the argininosuccinate lyase enzyme.\n* If the argininosuccinate lyase enzyme is misshapen or missing, it cannot fulfill its role in the urea cycle. Arginine is not produced, excess nitrogen is not converted to urea for excretion, and ammonia accumulates in the body. This buildup of ammonia damages the brain and other tissues and causes neurological problems and other signs and symptoms of argininosuccinic aciduria.\n* It is unclear how a lack of arginine contributes to the features of this condition.\n\n---\n\n**ASL Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/3)**\n\n**What is the ASL gene?**\n\nThe ASL gene provides instructions for making a protein called argininosuccinate lyase, which plays a crucial role in the urea cycle. This enzyme helps convert ammonia into urea, a waste product that can be safely removed from the body.\n\n**How does a mutation in the ASL gene affect the body?**\n\nA mutation in the ASL gene can lead to a deficiency of argininosuccinate lyase, resulting in a buildup of ammonia in the body. This accumulation of ammonia damages the brain and other tissues, causing neurological problems and other signs and symptoms of argininosuccinic aciduria.\n\n**What are some common mutations in the ASL gene?**\n\nMore than 130 mutations in the ASL gene have been found to cause argininosuccinic aciduria.

This enzyme participates in the urea cycle, which is a sequence of chemical reactions that takes place in liver cells.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\n* The urea cycle processes excess nitrogen that is generated as the body breaks down proteins.\n* The excess nitrogen is used to make a compound called urea, which is excreted from the body in urine.\n* Argininosuccinate synthase 1 is involved in the third step of the urea cycle. This step combines two protein building blocks (amino acids), citrulline and aspartate, to form a molecule called argininosuccinic acid.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Citrullinemia**: At least 118 mutations that cause type I citrullinemia have been identified in the ASS1 gene.

    "content": "**AST Test**\n\nWhat is an AST test?\n\nAn AST blood test measures the amount of AST in your blood. This test is commonly used to help diagnose liver damage or disease.\n\nAST (aspartate aminotransferase) is an enzyme, a protein that speeds up certain chemical reactions in your body. It is found mainly in your liver but also in your heart, muscles, and other tissues. Usually, you will have low levels of AST in your blood. When your liver or other cells that contain AST are damaged, they release AST into your blood. This can lead to high AST levels in your blood.\n\nAn AST test may be ordered by itself but is often ordered as part of a group of liver function tests.\n\nOther names: SGOT test, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase test; aspartate transaminase test\n\nWhat is it used for?\n\nAn AST blood test is often part of a routine blood screening to check the health of your liver. The test may help diagnose or monitor liver problems. It may also help diagnose other health conditions.\n\nWhy do I need an AST blood test?\n\nYou may get an AST blood test as part of your routine checkup or to monitor the treatment of a liver problem. You may also need a test if you have symptoms of liver damage, which may include:\n\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Lack of appetite\n* Fatigue\n* Weakness\n* Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow\n* Swelling and/or pain in your abdomen (belly)\n* Swelling in your ankles and legs\n* Dark-colored urine (pee) and/or light-colored stool (poop)\n* Frequent itching\n\nEven if you don't have symptoms, your health care provider may order an AST blood test if you're more likely to develop liver disease because of:\n\n* A family history of liver disease\n* Alcohol use disorder (AUD)\n* Obesity\n* Diabetes\n* Taking certain medicines that can cause liver damage\n* Hepatitis or exposure to hepatitis\n\nWhat happens during an AST blood test?\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\nWill I need to do anything to prepare for the test?\n\nYou may need to stop taking certain medicines before the test, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\nAre there any risks to the test?\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\nWhat do the results mean?\n\nLow levels of AST in the blood are usually considered normal.\n\nHigh levels of AST in the blood may be due to liver disease or other liver problems. Other reasons you may have high levels of AST can include:\n\n* Hepatitis\n* Cirrhosis\n* Mononucleosis\n* Heart procedures or problems\n* Pancreatitis\n* Hemochromatosis (too much iron in the body)\n* Deep burns\n* Seizures\n* Use of drugs that are toxic to the liver, especially alcohol use\n* Surgery\n\nIf your results are not in the normal range, it doesn't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Many things can affect your results, such as pregnancy, exercise, certain medicines, and your age or sex. Talk with your provider to learn what your results mean.\n\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\n\nIs there anything else I need to know about an AST blood test?\n\nYour health care provider may order an ALT blood test along with your AST blood test. ALT stands for alanine transaminase, which is another type of liver enzyme. If you have high levels of AST and/or ALT, it may mean that you have some type of liver damage.\n\n---\n\n**AST Test: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 2/2)**\n\n**Category:** Health\n\nAre there any special instructions I need to follow before the test?\n\nYou may need to stop taking certain medicines before the test, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\nAn AST test is usually ordered with other blood tests. You usually need to fast (not eat or drink) for up to 12 hours before these tests. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions.\n\nAre there any risks to the test?\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\nWhat do the results mean?\n\nLow levels of AST in the blood are usually considered normal.\n\nHigh levels of AST in the blood may be due to liver disease or other liver problems.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/asxl1/",
    "content": "**ASXL1 Gene**\n\nThe ASXL1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in a process known as chromatin remodeling. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and proteins that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. When DNA is tightly packed, gene activity (expression) is lower than when DNA is loosely packed.\n\nThrough its role in chromatin remodeling, the ASXL1 protein regulates the expression of many genes, including a group of genes known as HOX genes, which play important roles in development before birth. The ASXL1 protein can turn on (activate) or turn off (repress) HOX genes depending on when they are needed.\n\nThe ASXL1 protein may have an additional role in gene regulation by signaling to molecules to add a methyl group (a process called methylation) to an area near a gene called the promoter region, which controls gene activity. When a promoter region is methylated, gene activity is repressed, and when a promoter region is not methylated, the gene is active.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Bohring-Opitz Syndrome**: More than 20 mutations in the ASXL1 gene have been found to cause Bohring-Opitz syndrome, a condition that causes abnormal head size and shape, distinctive facial features, joint abnormalities, intellectual disability, and other signs and symptoms. Most of the ASXL1 gene mutations that cause Bohring-Opitz syndrome create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the ASXL1 protein, resulting in either an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein or a complete lack of ASXL1 protein.\n* **Systemic Mastocytosis**: MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Systemic mastocytosis.\n\n---\n\n**ASXL1 Gene**\n\n**Cancers**\n\nMutations in the ASXL1 gene have been associated with cancerous conditions of blood-forming cells, such as acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome. These mutations are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in cells that give rise to cancer.\n\nThe mutations associated with these conditions are likely \"gain-of-function,\" which means that they lead to an overactive ASXL1 protein. Researchers believe that the overactive ASXL1 protein leads to poor regulation of gene activity. It is unclear how this altered gene regulation plays a role in the development of cancer, but it is likely that overactive genes promote the growth of cancers by allowing abnormal blood cells to grow and divide uncontrollably.\n\nThe ASXL1 gene mutations involved in these cancers are different from the ones that cause Bohring-Opitz syndrome (described above). People with Bohring-Opitz syndrome are not thought to have an increased risk of developing cancer.\n\n**Bohring-Opitz Syndrome**\n\nMore than 20 mutations in the ASXL1 gene have been found to cause Bohring-Opitz syndrome, a condition that causes abnormal head size and shape, distinctive facial features, joint abnormalities, intellectual disability, and other signs and symptoms. Most of the ASXL1 gene mutations that cause Bohring-Opitz syndrome create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the ASXL1 protein, resulting in either an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein or a complete lack of ASXL1 protein.\n\nThese ASXL1 gene mutations are described as \"loss-of-function\" because they reduce the amount of functional ASXL1 protein available, which likely disrupts the regulation of the activity of HOX genes and other genes during development. Altered activity of HOX genes probably leads to the neurological and physical features of this condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* additional sex combs like 1\n* additional sex combs like transcriptional regulator 1\n* KIAA0978\n* putative Polycomb group protein ASXL1 isoform 1\n* putative Polycomb group protein ASXL1 isoform 2\n\n---\n\n**ASXL1 Gene**\n\n**Information & Resources**\n\nExpand Section\n\n* **Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry**\n\t+ Tests of ASXL1\n* **Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\t+ PubMed\n* **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\t+ ASXL TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATOR 1; ASXL1\n* **Gene and Variant Databases**\n\t+ NCBI Gene\n\t+ ClinVar\n\n**References**\n\nExpand Section\n\n* Aravind L, Iyer LM.

Many people with this condition experience prickling or tingling sensations (paresthesias), absent reflexes, weakness, and a reduced ability to feel pain. Affected individuals often get open sores (ulcers) on their feet, and because they cannot feel the pain of these sores, they may not seek immediate treatment. Without treatment, the ulcers can become infected and may require amputation of the surrounding area.\n\nAt least four ATL1 gene mutations have been found to cause hereditary sensory neuropathy type ID. These mutations impair nerve cell function and decrease transmission of nerve impulses, similar to the effects of ATL1 gene mutations that cause spastic paraplegia type 3A (described above). It is unclear why some ATL1 gene mutations cause hereditary sensory neuropathy type ID and others cause spastic paraplegia type 3A.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\nAD-FSP, ATLA1_HUMAN, atlastin, atlastin1, FSP1, GBP3, guanylate-binding protein 3\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nTests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry: Tests of ATL1\nScientific Articles on PubMed: PubMed\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: ATLASTIN GTPase 1; ATL1, NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE ID; HSN1D\n\n---\n\n**ATL1 Gene**\n\n**What is the ATL1 gene?**\n\nThe ATL1 gene, also known as ATLASTIN GTPase 1, plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the nervous system.

    "content": "**ATM Gene**\n\nThe ATM gene provides instructions for making a protein that is located primarily in the nucleus of cells, where it helps control the rate at which cells grow and divide. This protein also plays an important role in the normal development and activity of several body systems, including the nervous system and the immune system.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\n* The ATM protein assists cells in recognizing damaged or broken DNA strands.\n* DNA can be damaged by agents such as toxic chemicals or radiation.\n* Breaks in DNA strands also occur naturally when chromosomes exchange genetic material during cell division.\n* The ATM protein coordinates DNA repair by activating enzymes that fix the broken strands.\n* Efficient repair of damaged DNA strands helps maintain the stability of the cell's genetic information.\n\nBecause of its central role in cell division and DNA repair, the ATM protein is of great interest in cancer research.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Ataxia-telangiectasia**: Researchers have identified several hundred variants (also called mutations) in the ATM gene that cause ataxia-telangiectasia. This disorder is characterized by progressive difficulty with coordinating movements (ataxia) beginning in early childhood.\n* **Bladder cancer**\n* **Breast cancer**\n* **Melanoma**\n\n---\n\n**ATM Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Other Cancers**\n\nResearch suggests that people who carry one altered copy of the ATM gene in each cell may have an increased risk of developing several other types of cancer. In particular, some studies have shown that cancers of the breast, stomach, bladder, pancreas, lung, and ovaries occur more frequently in ATM gene variant carriers than in people who do not carry these variants. The results of similar studies, however, have been conflicting. Additional research is needed to clarify which other types of cancer, if any, are associated with ATM gene variants.\n\n**Ataxia-Telangiectasia**\n\nResearchers have identified several hundred variants (also called mutations) in the ATM gene that cause ataxia-telangiectasia. This disorder is characterized by progressive difficulty with coordinating movements (ataxia) beginning in early childhood. People with this disorder have variants in both copies of the ATM gene in each cell. Most of these variants disrupt protein production, resulting in an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the ATM protein. Cells without any functional ATM protein are hypersensitive to radiation and do not respond normally to DNA damage. Instead of activating DNA repair, the altered ATM protein allows variants to accumulate in other genes, which may cause cells to grow and divide in an uncontrolled way. This kind of unregulated cell growth can lead to the formation of cancerous tumors. In addition, ATM gene variants can allow cells to die inappropriately, particularly affecting cells in a part of the brain involved in coordinating movements (the cerebellum). This loss of brain cells causes the movement problems characteristic of ataxia-telangiectasia.\n\n**Bladder Cancer**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about bladder cancer.\n\n**Breast Cancer**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about breast cancer.\n\n**Melanoma**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about melanoma.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* AT mutated\n* AT protein\n* AT1\n* ATA\n* Ataxia telangiectasia mutated\n* ATM_HUMAN\n* Human phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase homolog serine-protein kinase\n* ATM\n* TEL1\n* TELO1\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about various health conditions, including those related to the ATM gene.\n\n---\n\n**ATM Gene**\n\nThe ATM gene plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing cancer.

    "content": "**ATP1A3 Gene**\n\nThe **ATP1A3 gene** provides instructions for making one part (the alpha-3 subunit) of a protein known as Na+/K+ ATPase or the sodium pump. This protein uses energy from a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to transport charged atoms (ions) into and out of cells.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\n* The ATP1A3 gene is critical for normal function of nerve cells in the brain (neurons).\n* The movement of sodium and potassium ions helps regulate the electrical activity of these cells and plays an important role in the signaling process that controls muscle movement.\n* The activity of Na+/K+ ATPase also helps regulate cell size (volume).\n* Additionally, Na+/K+ ATPase helps regulate a process called neurotransmitter reuptake.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood**: Variants in the ATP1A3 gene are the primary cause of this neurological condition.\n\t+ Characterized by recurrent episodes of temporary paralysis that often affects only one side of the body (hemiplegia).\n\t+ During some episodes, the paralysis alternates from one side to the other or affects both sides of the body at the same time.\n\t+ Most ATP1A3 gene variants associated with alternating hemiplegia of childhood change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the alpha-3 subunit of Na+/K+ ATPase.\n\n---\n\n**ATP1A3 Gene**\n\n**Rapid-onset Dystonia Parkinsonism**\n\nMultiple variants in the ATP1A3 gene have been found to cause a rare movement disorder called rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism. This disorder is characterized by the abrupt appearance of signs and symptoms over a period of hours to days. Most of the ATP1A3 gene variants that cause this disorder change single amino acids in the alpha-3 subunit of Na+/K+ ATPase. Changes in the protein's structure can reduce its activity or make it unstable. Studies suggest that the defective Na+/K+ ATPase is unable to transport sodium ions normally, which disrupts the electrical activity of neurons in the brain. However, it is unclear how a malfunctioning Na+/K+ ATPase causes the movement abnormalities seen in people with rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism.\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nVariants in the ATP1A3 gene can cause a group of features: cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss. This specific presentation is known as CAPOS syndrome (the abbreviation comes from the first letter of each feature). Affected individuals usually develop signs and symptoms of CAPOS syndrome in infancy or early childhood during or following an illness that causes a fever. To date, all instances of CAPOS syndrome have been caused by the same variant in the ATP1A3 gene. This change replaces the amino acid glutamic acid with the amino acid lysine at position 818 in the alpha-3 subunit of Na+/K+ ATPase (written as Glu818Lys or E818K). This genetic change appears to impair the pump's ability to transport ions, although it is unclear how the variant causes the specific features of CAPOS syndrome.\n\n**Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood**\n\nVariants in the ATP1A3 gene are the primary cause of a neurological condition called alternating hemiplegia of childhood. This condition is characterized by recurrent episodes of temporary paralysis that often affects only one side of the body (hemiplegia). During some episodes, the paralysis alternates from one side to the other or affects both sides of the body at the same time. Most ATP1A3 gene variants associated with alternating hemiplegia of childhood change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the alpha-3 subunit of Na+/K+ ATPase.

This enzyme belongs to a family of ATPase enzymes that help control the level of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) inside cells. The SERCA1 enzyme is found in skeletal muscle cells.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nWithin muscle cells, the SERCA1 enzyme is located in the membrane of a structure called the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This structure plays a major role in muscle contraction and relaxation by storing and releasing calcium ions. When calcium ions are transported out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, muscles contract; when calcium ions are transported into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, muscles relax. The SERCA1 enzyme transports calcium ions from the cell into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, triggering muscle relaxation.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Brody Myopathy**: At least 10 mutations in the ATP2A1 gene have been found to cause Brody myopathy, a muscle disorder characterized by muscle cramping after exercise. Most ATP2A1 gene mutations lead to a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the SERCA1 enzyme, resulting in a nonfunctional enzyme. Other mutations lead to the production of a SERCA1 enzyme with decreased function. As a result, calcium ions are slow to enter the sarcoplasmic reticulum and muscle relaxation is delayed.

This movement of protons helps regulate the relative acidity (pH) of cells and their surrounding environment.\n*   Within cells, V-ATPases help regulate the pH of particular cell compartments, including endosomes and lysosomes, which digest and recycle materials that the cell no longer needs.\n*   Studies suggest that V-ATPases are also involved in the movement (trafficking) of small sac-like structures called vesicles. Vesicles transport many types of molecules within cells.\n*   V-ATPases play a key role in a complex process called glycosylation, in which proteins are modified by adding sugar molecules. Glycosylation is necessary for the normal function of many different kinds of proteins.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nMore than 40 variants (also known as mutations) in the ATP6V0A2 gene have been identified in people with cutis laxa. ATP6V0A2 variants cause a form of the disorder called autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 2A (ARCL2A), which is characterized by loose, sagging skin; distinctive facial features; and larger than normal spaces (fontanelles) between the skull bones that close later than usual. Some affected individuals also have delayed development, intellectual disability, seizures, or problems with movement that can worsen over time.\n\n---\n\n**ATP6V0A2 Gene**\n\n**Variants in this gene cause cutis laxa and wrinkly skin syndrome**\n\nCutis laxa is a rare genetic disorder characterized by loose, sagging skin. Variants in the ATP6V0A2 gene have been identified in over 40 individuals with cutis laxa. One form of the disorder, called autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 2A (ARCL2A), is caused by variants in this gene and is characterized by loose, sagging skin; distinctive facial features; and larger than normal spaces between the skull bones that close later than usual.\n\nSome individuals with ARCL2A also experience delayed development, intellectual disability, seizures, or problems with movement that can worsen over time. Variants in this gene also cause a related condition called wrinkly skin syndrome, which typically has milder features.\n\n**How genetic changes affect the body**\n\nVariants in the ATP6V0A2 gene prevent the cell from producing a functional a2 subunit, which disrupts the normal function of V-ATPases. It is unclear how these genetic changes cause the signs and symptoms of cutis laxa. Researchers suspect that changes in V-ATPase function may disrupt the normal glycosylation of proteins, including several that are involved in the assembly and maintenance of elastic fibers.\n\nElastic fibers are slender bundles of proteins that provide strength and flexibility to connective tissue (tissue that supports the body's joints and organs). People with cutis laxa have a reduced density of elastic fibers, which weakens connective tissue in the skin, lungs, and other organs. These defects in connective tissue underlie many of the major features of the disorder.\n\n**Classification as a congenital disorder of glycosylation**\n\nBecause problems with glycosylation underlie ARCL2A, the condition is classified as a congenital disorder of glycosylation.\n\n**Other names for this gene**\n\n* A2V-ATPase\n* ATP6a2\n* ATP6N1D\n* ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal V0 subunit a2\n* J6B7\n* Stv1\n* TJ6\n* TJ6M\n* TJ6s\n* Vph1\n* VPP2_HUMAN\n\n**Additional information and resources**\n\n* Tests listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n\t+ Tests of ATP6V0A2\n* Scientific articles on PubMed:\n\t+ PubMed\n* Catalog of genes and diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal, V0 subunit a2; ATP6V0A2\n\n---\n\n**ATP6V0A2 Gene**\n\n**Genomic Location**\nThe ATP6V0A2 gene is found on chromosome 12.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Genes and Gene Therapy\n* Genetic Disorders\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n* Guillard M, Dimopoulou A, Fischer B, Morava E, Lefeber DJ, Kornak U, Wevers RA.

Each nephron consists of two parts: a renal corpuscle (also known as a glomerulus) that filters the blood, and a renal tubule that reabsorbs substances that are needed and eliminates unneeded substances in urine. The V-ATPase is involved in regulating the amount of acid that is removed from the blood into the urine, and also in maintaining the proper pH of the fluid in the inner ear (endolymph).\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Renal Tubular Acidosis with Deafness**: Several ATP6V0A4 gene mutations have been identified in people with renal tubular acidosis with deafness, a disorder involving excess acid in the blood (metabolic acidosis), bone weakness, and hearing loss caused by changes in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss).

As a result, the kidneys are less able to control the acidity of the blood, which leads to bone weakness caused by loss of bone minerals (demineralization) and other consequences of metabolic acidosis.

Occipital horn syndrome is characterized by loose and sagging skin, wedge-shaped calcium deposits in a bone at the base of the skull (the occipital bone), coarse hair, and loose joints.\n\nMost of the mutations that cause occipital horn syndrome reduce but do not eliminate the production of the ATP7A protein. A shortage of this protein impairs the absorption of copper from food and prevents its normal distribution to cells throughout the body. The decreased supply of copper can reduce the activity of numerous copper-containing enzymes, affecting the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels, and the nervous system.\n\n**Menkes Syndrome**\n\nResearchers have identified more than 150 mutations in the ATP7A gene that cause Menkes syndrome. Many of these mutations delete part of the gene and likely result in a shortened ATP7A protein. Other mutations insert additional DNA building blocks (nucleotides) into the gene or change single nucleotides. All of these mutations prevent the production of functional ATP7A protein.\n\nAs a result, the absorption of copper from food is impaired, and copper is not supplied to certain enzymes. The abnormal protein may get stuck in the cell membrane and become unable to shuttle back and forth from the Golgi apparatus.\n\nThe disrupted activity of the ATP7A protein causes copper to be poorly distributed to cells in the body.

    "content": "**ATP7B Gene**\n\nThe ATP7B gene provides instructions for making a protein called copper-transporting ATPase 2. This protein is part of the P-type ATPase family, a group of proteins that transport metals into and out of cells by using energy stored in the molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Copper-transporting ATPase 2 is found primarily in the liver, with smaller amounts in the kidneys and brain. It plays a role in the transport of copper from the liver to other parts of the body. Copper is an important part of certain enzymes that maintain normal cell functions. Copper-transporting ATPase 2 is also important for the removal of excess copper from the body.\n\nWithin liver cells, copper-transporting ATPase 2 is found in a structure called the Golgi apparatus, which modifies newly produced enzymes and other proteins. Here, copper-transporting ATPase 2 supplies copper to a protein called ceruloplasmin, which transports copper to other parts of the body via the blood. If copper levels in the liver get too high, copper-transporting ATPase 2 leaves the Golgi and transfers copper to small sacs (vesicles) for elimination through bile. Bile is a substance produced by the liver that is important for digestion and the removal of waste products.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nWilson disease\n\nResearchers have identified more than 250 ATP7B gene mutations that cause Wilson disease. About half the mutations change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make copper-transporting ATPase 2. This type of mutation alters the 3-dimensional structure of the protein or its stability, preventing copper-transporting ATPase 2 from functioning properly. A common amino acid substitution replaces the amino acid histidine with the amino acid glutamine at position 1069 in the protein (written as His1069Gln or H1069Q). This particular mutation occurs in nearly 40 percent of affected individuals with a Northern or Eastern European ancestry. Approximately one-third of Asians with Wilson disease have a mutation that replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid leucine at position 778 (written as Arg778Leu or R778L).\n\n---\n\n**ATP7B Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Wilson Disease**\n\nResearchers have identified more than 250 ATP7B gene mutations that cause Wilson disease.

As a result, no protein is produced, or an abnormally small protein is made. These types of mutations usually result in symptoms that are more severe than those caused by mutations that change a single amino acid.\n\nWith a shortage of functional protein, removal of excess copper from the body is impaired. As a result, copper accumulates to toxic levels that can damage tissues and organs, particularly the liver and brain.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n*   ATP7B_HUMAN\n*   ATPase, Cu++ transporting, beta polypeptide\n*   Copper pump 2\n*   PWD\n*   WC1\n*   Wilson disease-associated protein\n*   WND\n\n---\n\n**ATP7B Gene**\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   Cater MA, Forbes J, La Fontaine S, Cox D, Mercer JF.
