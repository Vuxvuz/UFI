    "content": "**Changes in the Newborn at Birth**\n\nAs a newborn takes its first breath outside the womb, its body undergoes significant changes to adapt to life. These changes affect various systems, including the lungs, heart, blood vessels, liver, gastrointestinal tract, urinary system, immune system, and skin.\n\n**Lungs, Heart, and Blood Vessels**\n\nThe mother's placenta helps the baby \"breathe\" while it is growing in the womb. Oxygen and carbon dioxide flow through the blood in the placenta, allowing for the baby to have the proper amount of these chemicals in their body. At birth, the baby's lungs are filled with fluid and not inflated. The first breath sounds like a gasp as the newborn's central nervous system reacts to the sudden change in temperature and environment.\n\nOnce the baby takes its first breath, changes occur in the infant's lungs and circulatory system:\n\n*   Increased oxygen in the lungs causes a decrease in blood flow resistance to the lungs.\n*   Blood flow resistance of the baby's blood vessels also increases.\n*   Fluid drains or is absorbed from the respiratory system.\n*   The lungs inflate and begin working on their own, moving oxygen into the baby's bloodstream and removing carbon dioxide by breathing out (exhalation).\n\n**Body Temperature**\n\nA developing baby produces about twice as much heat as an adult. A small amount of heat is removed through the developing baby's skin, the amniotic fluid, and the uterine wall. After delivery, the newborn begins to lose heat. Receptors on the baby's skin send messages to the brain that the baby's body is cold. The baby's body creates heat by burning stores of brown fat, a type of fat found only in fetuses and newborns. Newborns are rarely seen to shiver.\n\n**Liver**\n\nIn the baby, the liver acts as a storage site for sugar (in the form of a chemical called glycogen) and iron. When the baby is born, the liver has various functions:\n\n*   It produces substances that help the blood to clot.\n*   It begins breaking down waste products such as excess red blood cells.\n*   It produces a protein that helps break down bilirubin. If the baby's body does not properly break down bilirubin, it can lead to newborn jaundice.\n\n**Gastrointestinal Tract**\n\nA baby's gastrointestinal system doesn't fully function until after birth.\n\n**Urinary System**\n\nThe developing baby's kidneys begin producing urine by 9 to 12 weeks into the pregnancy. After birth, the newborn will usually urinate within the first 24 hours of life. The kidneys become able to maintain the body's fluid and electrolyte balance.\n\nThe rate at which blood filters through the kidneys (glomerular filtration rate) increases sharply after birth and in the first 2 weeks of life. Still, it takes some time for the kidneys to get up to speed. Newborns have less ability to remove excess salt (sodium) or to concentrate or dilute the urine compared to adults. This ability improves over time.\n\n**Immune System**\n\nThe immune system begins to develop in the baby, and continues to mature through the child's first few years of life. The womb is a relatively sterile environment. But as soon as the baby is born, they are exposed to a variety of bacteria and other potentially disease-causing substances. Although newborn infants are more vulnerable to infection, their immune system can respond to infectious organisms.\n\nNewborns do carry some antibodies from their mother, which provide protection against infection. Breastfeeding also helps improve a newborn's immunity by continuing to supply antibodies from the mother to the baby.\n\n**Skin**\n\nNewborn skin will vary depending on the length of the pregnancy. Premature infants have thin, transparent skin. The skin of a full-term infant is thicker.\n\nCharacteristics of newborn skin:\n\n*   A fine hair called lanugo might cover the newborn's skin, especially in preterm babies. The hair should disappear within the first few weeks of the baby's life.\n*   A thick, waxy substance called vernix may cover the skin. This substance protects the baby while floating in amniotic fluid in the womb. Vernix should wash off during the baby's first bath.\n*   The skin might be cracking, peeling, or blotchy, but this should improve over time.\n\nAs a newborn navigates its first moments outside the womb, its body undergoes significant changes to adapt to life. Understanding these changes is crucial for providing proper care and ensuring the newborn's health and well-being.\n\n---\n\n**Changes in the Newborn at Birth**\n\nThe changes an infant's body undergoes to adapt to life outside the womb are numerous and complex. In this article, we will explore the various physiological changes that occur in a newborn's body after birth.\n\n**Lungs, Heart, and Blood Vessels**\n\nThe mother's placenta helps the baby \"breathe\" while it is growing in the womb. Oxygen and carbon dioxide flow through the blood in the placenta. Most of it goes to the heart and flows through the baby's body. This allows for the baby to have the proper amount of these chemicals in their body.\n\nAt birth, the baby's lungs are filled with fluid. They are not inflated. The baby takes the first breath within about 10 seconds after delivery. This breath sounds like a gasp, as the newborn's central nervous system reacts to the sudden change in temperature and environment.\n\nOnce the baby takes the first breath, a number of changes occur in the infant's lungs and circulatory system:\n\n*   Increased oxygen in the lungs causes a decrease in blood flow resistance to the lungs.\n*   Blood flow resistance of the baby's blood vessels also increases.\n*   Fluid drains or is absorbed from the respiratory system.\n*   The lungs inflate and begin working on their own, moving oxygen into the baby's bloodstream and removing carbon dioxide by breathing out (exhalation).\n\n**Body Temperature**\n\nA developing baby produces about twice as much heat as an adult. A small amount of heat is removed through the developing baby's skin, the amniotic fluid, and the uterine wall.\n\nAfter delivery, the newborn begins to lose heat. Receptors on the baby's skin send messages to the brain that the baby's body is cold. The baby's body creates heat by burning stores of brown fat, a type of fat found only in fetuses and newborns.

If the baby's body does not properly break down bilirubin, it can lead to newborn jaundice.\n\n**Gastrointestinal Tract**\n\nA baby's gastrointestinal system doesn't fully function until after birth.\n\nIn late pregnancy, the baby produces a tarry green or black waste substance called meconium. Meconium is the medical term for the newborn infant's first stools. Meconium is composed of amniotic fluid, mucus, lanugo (the fine hair that covers the baby's body before birth), bile, and cells that have been shed from the skin and intestinal tract. In some cases, the baby passes stools (meconium) while still inside the uterus.\n\n**Urinary System**\n\nThe developing baby's kidneys begin producing urine by 9 to 12 weeks into the pregnancy. After birth, the newborn will usually urinate within the first 24 hours of life.

    "content": "**Changing Your Ostomy Pouch**\n\nYour ostomy pouch is a heavy-duty plastic bag that you wear outside your body to collect your stool. Using an ostomy pouch is the best way to handle bowel movements after certain kinds of surgery on the colon or small intestine.\n\n**Your Ostomy Pouch**\n\nYour stool may be liquid or solid, depending on the kind of surgery you had. You may need your ostomy for just a short time. Or, you may need it for the rest of your life.\n\nThe ostomy pouch attaches to your belly, away from your belt line. It will be hidden under your clothing. The stoma is the opening in your skin where the pouch attaches.\n\nUsually you can do your normal activities, but you will have to change your diet a bit and watch for skin soreness. The pouches are odor-free, and they do not allow gas or stool to leak out when they are worn correctly.\n\n**Getting Your Supplies Ready**\n\nCollect your supplies before you start. You will need:\n\n*   A new pouch (a 1-piece system, or 2-piece system that has a wafer)\n*   A pouch clip\n*   Scissors\n*   A clean towel or paper towels\n*   Stoma powder\n*   Stoma paste or a ring seal\n*   Skin wipes\n*   A measuring card and a pen\n\nMany medical supply stores will deliver right to your home. Your nurse will get you started with the supplies you will need. After that, you will order your own supplies.\n\n**Changing Your Ostomy Pouch**\n\nThe bathroom is a good place to change your pouch. Empty your used pouch into the toilet first, if it needs emptying.\n\nGather your supplies. If you have a 2-piece pouch, be sure you have the special ring seal that sticks to your skin around the stoma.\n\nFollow these steps to prevent infection:\n\n*   Wash your hands with soap and water. Be sure to wash between your fingers and under your fingernails. Dry with a clean towel or paper towels.\n*   If you have a 2-piece pouch, press gently on the skin around your stoma with one hand, and remove the seal with your other hand. (If it is hard to remove the seal, you can use special pads. Ask your nurse about these.)\n*   Remove the pouch:\n\n    Keep the clip that is with the pouch. Put the old ostomy pouch in a bag and then place the bag in the trash.\n    Clean the skin around your stoma with warm soap and water and a clean washcloth or paper towels. Pat dry with a clean towel.\n\nCheck and seal your skin:\n\n*   Check your skin. A little bleeding is normal. Your skin should be pink or red. Contact your provider if it is purple, black, or blue.\n*   Wipe around the stoma with the special skin wipe. If your skin is a little wet, sprinkle some of the stoma powder on just the wet or open part.\n*   Lightly pat the special wipe on top of the powder and your skin again.\n*   Let the area air-dry for 1 to 2 minutes.\n\nMeasure your stoma:\n\n*   Use your measuring card to find the circle size that matches the size of your stoma. Do not touch the card to your skin.\n*   If you have a 2-piece system, trace the circle size onto the back of the ring seal and cut out this size. Make sure the cut edges are smooth.\n\nAttach the pouch:\n\n*   Attach the pouch to the ring seal if you have a 2-piece ostomy system.\n*   Peel the paper off the ring seal.\n*   Squirt stoma paste around the hole in the seal, or place the special stoma ring around the opening.\n*   Place the seal evenly around the stoma. Hold it in place for a few minutes. Try holding a warm washcloth over the seal to help make it stick to your skin.\n*   If you need them, put cotton balls or special gel packs in your pouch to keep it from leaking.\n*   Attach the pouch clip or use Velcro to close the pouch.\n*   Wash your hands again with warm soap and water.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n*   Your stoma smells bad, there is pus draining from it, or it is bleeding a lot.\n*   Your stoma is changing in some way. It is a different color, it is getting longer, or it is pulling into your skin.\n*   The skin around your stoma is bulging.\n*   There is blood in your stool.\n*   You have a fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher, or you have chills.\n*   You feel sick to your stomach, or you are vomiting.\n*   Your stools are looser than normal.\n*   You have a lot of pain in your belly, or you are bloated (puffy or swollen).\n*   You have had no gas or stool for 4 hours.\n*   You have a big increase in the amount of stool collecting in your pouch.\n\n---\n\n**Changing Your Ostomy Pouch**\n\nThe bathroom is a good place to change your pouch.

    "content": "**Changing Your Sleep Habits**\n\nSleep patterns are often learned as children. When we repeat these patterns over many years, they become habits.\n\n**Insomnia is Difficulty Falling Asleep or Staying Asleep**\n\nIn many cases, you can relieve insomnia by making a few simple lifestyle changes. But, it may take some time if you have had the same sleep habits for years.\n\n**How Much Sleep is Enough?**\n\nPeople who have insomnia are often worried about getting enough sleep. The more they try to sleep, the more frustrated and upset they get, and the harder it becomes to sleep.\n\n* While 7 to 8 hours a night is recommended for most people, children and teenagers need more.\n* Older people tend to do fine with less sleep at night. But they may still need about 8 hours of sleep over a 24-hour period.\n\n**Change Your Lifestyle**\n\nBefore you go to bed:\n\n* Write down all the things that worry you in a journal. This way, you can transfer your worries from your mind to paper, leaving your thoughts quieter and better suited for falling asleep.\n\nDuring the day:\n\n* Be more active. Walk or exercise for at least 30 minutes on most days.\n* Do not take naps during the day or in the evening.\n* Stop or cut back on smoking and drinking alcohol. And reduce your caffeine intake.\n* If you are taking any medicines, diet pills, herbs, or supplements, ask your health care provider about the effects they may have on your sleep.\n* Find ways to manage stress.\n\nLearn about relaxation techniques, such as guided imagery, listening to music, or practicing yoga or meditation.\nListen to your body when it tells you to slow down or take a break.\n\n**Change Your Bedtime Habits**\n\nYour bed is for sleeping. Do not do things like eat or work while in bed.\n\n* Develop a sleep routine.\n* If possible, wake up around the same time each day.\n* Go to bed around the same time every day, but not more than 8 hours before you expect to start your day.\n* Avoid beverages with caffeine or alcohol in the evening.\n* Avoid eating heavy meals at least 2 hours before going to sleep.\n\nFind calming, relaxing activities to do before bedtime.\n\n* Read or take a bath so that you do not dwell on worrisome issues.\n* Do not watch TV or use a computer near the time you want to fall asleep.\n* Avoid activity that increases your heart rate for the 2 hours before going to bed.\n* Make sure your sleep area is quiet, dark, and at a temperature you like.\n\nIf you cannot fall asleep within 30 minutes, get up and move to another room.

When we repeat these patterns over many years, they become habits.\n\n**Insomnia is Difficulty Falling Asleep or Staying Asleep**\n\nIn many cases, you can relieve insomnia by making a few simple lifestyle changes. But, it may take some time if you have had the same sleep habits for years.\n\n**How Much Sleep is Enough?**\n\nWhile 7 to 8 hours a night is recommended for most people, children and teenagers need more. Older people tend to do fine with less sleep at night. But they may still need about 8 hours of sleep over a 24-hour period.\n\nRemember, the quality of sleep and how rested you feel afterward is as important as how much sleep you get.\n\n**Change Your Lifestyle**\n\nBefore you go to bed:\n\n*   Write down all the things that worry you in a journal.

    "content": "**Channelopathy-Associated Congenital Insensitivity to Pain**\n\n**Description**\n\nChannelopathy-associated congenital insensitivity to pain is a condition that inhibits the ability to perceive physical pain. From birth, affected individuals never feel pain in any part of their body when injured. People with this condition can feel the difference between sharp and dull and hot and cold, but they cannot sense, for example, that a hot beverage is burning their tongue.\n\nPain is a vital signal that helps people avoid danger and injuries. People who cannot feel pain experience more  injuries and may have shorter life expectancies.\n\n**First Signs**\n\nThe first signs of channelopathy-associated congenital insensitivity to pain often occur when an infant shows no response to stimuli such as an injury or medical procedures like vaccines. Young children with this condition may have wounds from biting or burning themselves.\n\n**Health Issues**\n\nA lack of pain awareness often leads individuals to develop wounds, bruises, broken bones, and other health issues that may go undetected. Long lasting joint injuries (often occurring alongside broken bones) can lead to joint deformities and often the loss of normal use of that body part. Eye injuries that go unnoticed can lead to vision loss. Many people with channelopathy-associated congenital insensitivity to pain also have a complete loss of the sense of smell (anosmia).\n\n**Peripheral Neuropathy**\n\nChannelopathy-associated congenital insensitivity to pain is considered a form of peripheral neuropathy because it affects the peripheral nervous system, which connects the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to cells that detect sensations such as touch, smell, and pain.\n\n---\n\n**Channelopathy-associated Congenital Insensitivity to Pain**\n\n**What is Channelopathy-associated Congenital Insensitivity to Pain?**\n\nChannelopathy-associated congenital insensitivity to pain is a rare condition characterized by an inability to sense physical pain from birth. It is considered a form of peripheral neuropathy, affecting the peripheral nervous system that connects the brain and spinal cord to muscles and cells that detect sensations such as touch, smell, and pain.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe first signs of channelopathy-associated congenital insensitivity to pain often occur when an infant shows no response to stimuli such as an injury or medical procedures like vaccines. Young children with this condition may have wounds from biting or burning themselves. A lack of pain awareness often leads individuals to develop wounds, bruises, broken bones, and other health issues that may go undetected.\n\n**Causes**\n\nVariants (also called mutations) in the SCN9A gene cause channelopathy-associated congenital insensitivity to pain. The SCN9A gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha subunit) of a sodium channel called NaV1.7. Sodium channels create an opening in the cell membrane to transport positively charged sodium atoms (sodium ions) into cells.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nChannelopathy-associated congenital insensitivity to pain is a rare condition, though its exact prevalence is unknown. It is one of about 10 disorders characterized by a lifelong inability to sense physical pain.\n\n---\n\n**Channelopathy-associated Congenital Insensitivity to Pain**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder.

Peripheral nerves carry movement and sensation signals between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body. Symptoms usually start around the teen years. Foot problems such as high arches or hammertoes can be early symptoms. As CMT progresses, your lower legs may weaken. Later, your hands may also become weak.\n\n**How is it diagnosed?**\n\nDoctors diagnose CMT by doing a neurologic exam, nerve tests, genetic tests, or a nerve biopsy.\n\n**Is there a cure?**\n\nThere is no cure. The disease can be so mild you don't realize you have it or severe enough to make you weak. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, braces and other devices and sometimes surgery can help.\n\n**NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke**\n\n**Start Here**\n\n* Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (Muscular Dystrophy Association) - PDF\n* Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease  (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke)\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Signs and Symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) (Muscular Dystrophy Association)\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\n* Electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Studies  (National Library of Medicine)\n\t+ Also in Spanish\n\n**Living With**\n\n* Medical Management (Muscular Dystrophy Association)\n\n**Related Issues**\n\n* Peripheral Neuropathy  (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke)\n\t+ Also in Spanish\n\n**Specifics**\n\n* Types of CMT (Muscular Dystrophy Association)\n\n**Genetics**\n\n* Causes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) (Muscular Dystrophy Association)\n* Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n* Learning about Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease  (National Human Genome Research Institute)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n* ClinicalTrials.gov: Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease  (National Institutes of Health)\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\n* References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\n\t+ Article: Combining dynamin 2 myopathy and neuropathy mutations rescues both phenotypes.\n\t+ Article: Feasibility, Validity, and Reliability of the Virtual CMT Infant Toddler Scale...\n\t+ Article: Split Hand Syndrome in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type X1 (CMTX1): A Clinical,...\n\n---\n\n**Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease?**\n\nCharcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a group of inherited disorders that affect the peripheral nerves, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy. There are several subtypes of CMT, each with distinct genetic and clinical features.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Types of CMT:**\n\t+ CMT1: Most common subtype, caused by mutations in genes encoding myelin proteins\n\t+ CMT2: Intermediate form, characterized by demyelination and remyelination\n\t+ CMT3: Severe form, associated with severe demyelination and axonal loss\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nSymptoms of CMT include:\n\n* Muscle weakness and atrophy in the hands and feet\n* Sensory disturbances, such as numbness or tingling\n* Difficulty walking or maintaining balance\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through a combination of clinical evaluation, electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction studies (NCS), and genetic testing.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for CMT, but various treatments can help manage symptoms and slow disease progression. These may include:\n\n* Physical therapy to maintain muscle strength and mobility\n* Orthotics or assistive devices to aid walking or balance\n* Pain management strategies, such as medication or alternative therapies\n* Genetic counseling for families with a history of CMT\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Research and Resources**\n\nThe National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is the primary NIH organization for research on Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. The NINDS supports studies aimed at understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying CMT, as well as developing new treatments.\n\nFor patients and families affected by CMT, resources are available through organizations such as the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) and the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\nFeasibility, Validity, and Reliability of the Virtual CMT Infant Toddler Scale\nSplit Hand Syndrome in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type X1 (CMTX1): A Clinical Study\nCombining dynamin 2 myopathy and neuropathy mutations rescues both phenotypes\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\nDegenerative Nerve Diseases\nMuscle Disorders",

These are called the peripheral nerves.\n\n**Causes**\n\nCharcot-Marie-Tooth is one of the most common nerve-related disorders passed down through families (inherited). Changes to any of at least 40 genes can cause different forms of this disease.\n\nThe disease leads to damage or destruction to the covering (myelin sheath) around nerve fibers.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nNerves that stimulate movement (called the motor nerves) are most severely affected. The nerves in the legs are affected first and most severely.\n\nSymptoms most often begin between mid-childhood and early adulthood. They may include:\n\n* Foot deformity (very high arch to feet)\n* Foot drop (inability to point foot upward to hold it horizontal)\n* Loss of lower leg muscle, which leads to skinny calves\n* Numbness in the foot or leg\n* \"Slapping\" gait (feet hit the floor hard when walking)\n* Weakness of the hips, legs, or feet\n\nLater, similar symptoms may appear in the arms and hands. These may include a claw-like hand.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA physical exam may show:\n\n* Difficulty lifting up the foot and making toe-out movements (foot drop)\n* Lack of stretch reflexes in the legs\n* Loss of muscle control and atrophy (shrinking of the muscles) in the foot or leg\n* Thickened nerve bundles under the skin of the legs\n\nNerve conduction tests are often done to identify different forms of the disorder. A nerve biopsy may confirm the diagnosis.\n\nGenetic testing is also available for most forms of the disease.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no known cure. Orthopedic surgery or equipment (such as braces or orthopedic shoes) may make it easier to walk.\n\nPhysical and occupational therapy may help maintain muscle strength and improve independent functioning.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nCharcot-Marie-Tooth disease slowly gets worse. Some parts of the body may become numb, and pain can range from mild to severe. Eventually the disease may cause disability.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Progressive inability to walk\n* Progressive weakness\n* Injury to areas of the body that have decreased sensation\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if there is ongoing weakness or decreased sensation in the feet or legs.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nGenetic counseling and testing is advised if there is a strong family history of the disorder.\n\n---\n\n**Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease?**\n\nCharcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a nerve-related disorder that leads to damage or destruction of the covering (myelin sheath) around nerve fibers.

    "content": "**Charley Horse**\n\nA charley horse is the common name for a muscle spasm or cramp. Muscle spasms can occur in any muscle in the body, but often happen in the leg. When a muscle is in spasm, it contracts without your control and does not relax.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMuscle spasms often occur when a muscle is overused or injured. Things that might bring on a muscle spasm include:\n\n* Exercising when you have not had enough fluids (you're dehydrated).\n* Having low levels of minerals such as potassium or calcium.\n* Some spasms occur because the nerve that connects to a muscle is irritated. One example is when a herniated disk irritates the spinal nerves and causes pain and spasm in the back muscles.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nWhen a muscle goes into spasm it feels very tight. It is sometimes described as a knot. The pain can be severe.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTo diagnose a spasm, your health care provider will look for tight or hard muscles that are very tender to the touch. There are no imaging studies or blood tests for this condition. If the spasm is caused by nerve irritation, such as in the back, an MRI may be helpful to find the cause of the problem.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nStop your activity and try stretching and massaging the affected muscle at the first sign of a spasm.\n\n* Heat will relax the muscle at first.\n* Ice may be helpful after the first spasm and when the pain has improved.\n* If the muscle is still sore after heat and ice, you can use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (such as ibuprofen or naproxen) to help with pain. In more severe cases, your provider can prescribe antispasm medicines.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThings you can do to lessen the chance of muscle cramps include:\n\n* Stretch to improve your flexibility.\n* Change your workouts so that you are exercising within your ability.\n* Drink plenty of fluids while exercising and increase your potassium intake.

If an irritated nerve is involved, you might need physical therapy or even surgery.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMuscle spasms will get better with rest and time. The outlook is excellent for most people. Learning how to exercise properly with the right training and enough fluid intake can prevent spasms from occurring regularly.\n\n---\n\n**Charley Horse**\n\nA charley horse is a muscle cramp that occurs when the muscles in your leg become overused or fatigued. It's called a charley horse because it can feel like a horse has kicked you in the leg.\n\n**Causes of Muscle Cramps**\n\nMuscle cramps can occur for several reasons, including:\n\n*   Overuse or fatigue of the muscles\n*   Dehydration or electrolyte imbalance\n*   Certain medical conditions, such as hypokalemia (low potassium levels)\n*   Poor circulation\n\n**Symptoms of Muscle Cramps**\n\nThe symptoms of muscle cramps can vary depending on the severity of the cramp. Some common symptoms include:\n\n*   Severe pain in the affected leg\n*   Weakness or numbness in the affected leg\n*   Muscle spasms that can spread to other parts of the body\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf you experience any of the following, contact your healthcare provider immediately:\n\n*   You have a muscle spasm with severe pain.\n*   You have weakness with your muscle spasm.\n*   You have a muscle spasm that does not stop and it spreads to other parts of the body.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo lessen the chance of muscle cramps, consider the following:\n\n*   Stretch before exercising to improve flexibility\n*   Change your workout routine to avoid overexertion\n*   Drink plenty of fluids while exercising and increase potassium intake through foods like orange juice and bananas\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nMuscle spasm is another name for a charley horse.\n\n**References**\n\nGeiderman JM, Torbati S.

They could also be planned, as in the case of a terrorist attack with a chemical weapon.\n\nSome hazardous chemicals have been developed by military organizations for use in warfare. Examples are nerve agents such as sarin and VX. Many hazardous chemicals are used in industry - for example, chlorine, ammonia, and benzene. Some can be made from everyday items such as household cleaners.\n\nAlthough there are no guarantees of safety during a chemical emergency, you can take actions to protect yourself. You should have a disaster plan. Being prepared can help reduce fear, anxiety, and losses. If you do experience a disaster, it is normal to feel stressed. You may need help in finding ways to cope.\n\n**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention**\n\n*   Learn More: About Chemical Emergencies (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n*   Chemical Emergency Preparedness (American Red Cross)\n*   Chemical Fact Sheets (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n*   Chemical pneumonitis (Medical Encyclopedia)\n*   Also in Spanish: Household Chemical Emergencies (Department of Homeland Security) and Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) (Department of Health and Human Services)\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nReferences and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine):\n\n*   Article: Medical preparedness for bioterrorism and chemical warfare: A public health integration... \n*   Article: 4th generation of warfare agents - Novichoks: Threats, problems, challenges for... \n*   Article: Click-chemistry-derived oxime library reveals efficient reactivators of nerve agent-inhibited butyrylcholinesterase suitable...",

    "content": "**Chemical Burn or Reaction**\n\nChemicals that touch skin can lead to a reaction on the skin, throughout the body, or both.\n\n*   **Considerations**\n    *   Chemical exposure is not always obvious. You should suspect chemical exposure if an otherwise healthy person becomes ill for no apparent reason, particularly if an empty chemical container is found nearby.\n    *   Exposure to chemicals at work over a long period of time can cause changing symptoms as the chemical builds up in the person's body.\n    *   If the person has a chemical in their eyes, see first aid for eye emergencies.\n    *   If the person has swallowed or inhaled a dangerous chemical, call a local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nDepending on the type of exposure, the symptoms may include:\n\n*   Abdominal pain\n*   Breathing difficulty\n*   Bright red or bluish skin and lips\n*   Convulsions (seizures)\n*   Dizziness\n*   Eye pain, burning or watering\n*   Headache\n*   Hives, itching, swelling, or weakness resulting from an allergic reaction\n*   Irritability\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Pain where the skin has come in contact with the toxic substance\n*   Rash, blisters, burns on the skin\n*   Unconsciousness or other states of altered level of consciousness\n\n**First Aid**\n\nMake sure that all rescuers have appropriate safety gear, this may include eye protection and skin protection.\n\nRemove the victim from the area of exposure, or make sure the cause of the burn or exposure has been removed. Try not to come in contact with it yourself. If the chemical is dry, brush off any excess. Avoid brushing it into your eyes or the victim's eyes. Remove any clothing and jewelry.\n\nFlush the chemicals off the skin surface using cool running water for 15 minutes or more unless the chemical exposure is to dry lime (calcium oxide, also called 'quick lime') or to elemental metals such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphorous, and lithium.\n\nTreat the person for shock if they appear faint, pale, or if there is shallow, rapid breathing. Apply cool, wet compresses to relieve pain. Wrap the burned area with a dry sterile dressing (if possible) or clean cloth. Protect the burned area from pressure and friction.\n\nMinor chemical burns will most often heal without further treatment. However, if there is a second or third degree burn or if there is an overall body reaction, get medical help right away. In severe cases, don't leave the person alone and watch carefully for reactions affecting the entire body.\n\nNote: If a chemical gets into the eyes, flush them with water right away. Continue to flush the eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes. Get medical help right away.\n\n**DO NOT**\n\n*   Do not apply any household remedy such as ointment or salve to a chemical burn.\n*   Do not become contaminated by the chemical as you give first aid.\n*   Do not disturb a blister or remove dead skin from a chemical burn.\n*   Do not try to neutralize any chemical without consulting the poison control center or a health care provider.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCall for medical help right away if the person is having difficulty breathing, is having seizures, or is unconscious.\n\n---\n\n**Chemical Burn or Reaction**\n\nIf you suspect someone has been exposed to a chemical, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCall for medical help right away if the person is having difficulty breathing, is having seizures, or is unconscious.\n\n**Prevention**\n\n*   All chemicals should be stored out of the reach of young children -- preferably in a locked cabinet.\n*   Avoid mixing different products that contain toxic chemicals such as ammonia and bleach. The mixture can give off hazardous fumes.\n*   Avoid prolonged (even low-level) exposure to chemicals.\n*   Avoid using potentially toxic substances in the kitchen or around food.\n*   Buy potentially poisonous substance in safety containers, and buy only as much as needed.\n*   Many household products are made of toxic chemicals.

If so, it's essential to understand what to expect from the treatment. In this article, we'll discuss the importance of asking questions to your doctor and provide guidance on how to navigate the chemotherapy process.\n\n**Understanding Chemotherapy**\n\nChemotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses drugs to kill cancer cells. It's often used in conjunction with other treatments, such as surgery or radiation therapy. The goal of chemotherapy is to eliminate cancer cells while minimizing harm to healthy tissues.\n\n**What to Ask Your Doctor**\n\nWhen discussing chemotherapy with your doctor, be sure to ask the following questions:\n\n*   What are the potential benefits and risks of chemotherapy for my specific type of cancer?\n*   How will the chemotherapy regimen be tailored to my individual needs?\n*   What are the possible side effects of the treatment, and how can they be managed?\n*   How will my response to the treatment be monitored, and what follow-up care can I expect?\n\n**Support Resources**\n\nIf you're considering chemotherapy, it's essential to have a support system in place. The National Cancer Institute offers a wealth of information on coping with cancer treatment, including tips on managing side effects and finding emotional support.\n\nBy asking questions and seeking guidance from your doctor, you'll be better equipped to navigate the chemotherapy process and make informed decisions about your care.",

Chemotherapy may be used to:\n\n* Cure the cancer\n* Shrink the cancer\n* Prevent the cancer from spreading\n* Relieve symptoms the cancer may be causing\n\n**How Chemotherapy Is Given**\n\nDepending on the type of cancer and where it is found, chemotherapy medicines may be given different ways, including:\n\n* Injections or shots into the muscles\n* Injections or shots under the skin\n* Into an artery\n* Into a vein (intravenous, or IV)\n* Pills taken by mouth\n* Shots into the fluid around the spinal cord or brain\n\nWhen chemotherapy is given over a longer period, a thin catheter can be placed into a large vein near the heart. This is called a central line. The catheter is placed during a minor surgery.\n\nThere are many types of catheters, including:\n\n* Central venous catheter\n* Central venous catheter with a port\n* Percutaneously inserted central catheter (PICC)\n\nA central line can stay in the body over a long period of time. It will need to be flushed on a periodic basis to prevent blood clots from forming inside the central line.\n\nDifferent chemotherapy medicines may be given at the same time or after each other. Radiation therapy may be received before, after, or during chemotherapy.\n\nChemotherapy is most often given in cycles. These cycles may last 1 day, several days, or a few weeks or more. There will usually be a rest period when no chemotherapy is given between each cycle. A rest period may last for days, weeks, or months.

You may be told to hold your breath for short period of time.\n\nThe complete scan takes 30 seconds to a few minutes.\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\nCertain CT scans require a special dye, called contrast, to be delivered into the body before the test starts. Contrast highlights specific areas inside the body and creates a clearer image. If your health care provider requests a CT scan with intravenous contrast, you will be given it through a vein (IV) in your arm or hand. A blood test to measure your kidney function may be done before the test. This test is to make sure your kidneys are healthy enough to filter the contrast.\n\nYou may be given medicine to help you relax during the test.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nA chest CT scan quickly creates detailed pictures of the body. The test may be used to get a better view of the structures inside the chest. A CT scan is one of the best ways of looking at soft tissues such as the heart and lungs.\n\nA chest CT may be done:\n\n*   After a chest injury\n*   When a tumor or mass (clump of cells) is suspected, including a solitary pulmonary nodule seen on a chest x-ray\n*   To determine the size, shape, and position of organs in the chest and upper abdomen\n*   To look for bleeding or fluid collections in the lungs or other areas\n*   To look for infection or inflammation in the chest\n*   To look for blood clots in the lungs\n*   To look for scarring in the lungs\n*   To look for emphysema\n\n---\n\n**Chest CT: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 3/5)**\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nBefore the test, you may be asked to:\n\n* Tell your provider if you're pregnant, as chest CT scans are generally avoided during pregnancy\n* Inform your provider about any allergies to IV contrast, which may require pre-medication before the test\n* Avoid eating or drinking anything for 4 to 6 hours if contrast is used\n* Weigh less than 300 pounds (136 kilograms) due to weight limits on CT scanners\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nDuring the test, you may experience:\n\n* Discomfort from lying on a hard table\n* A slight burning sensation, metallic taste, and warm flushing of the body if contrast is given through an IV\n* No recovery time, unless you were given medicine to relax\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nA chest CT scan quickly creates detailed pictures of the body, making it one of the best ways to look at soft tissues like the heart and lungs.

However, the risk from any one scan is small, and it increases as more scans are done.\n\n---\n\n**Chest CT**\n\n**Risks**\n\nCT scans use low levels of ionizing radiation, which has the potential to cause cancer and other defects. However, the risk from any one scan is small. The risk increases as many more scans are done.\n\nThe most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. If a person with an iodine allergy is given this type of contrast, nausea, sneezing, vomiting, itching, or hives may occur. In rare cases, the dye can cause a life-threatening allergic response called anaphylaxis. If you have any trouble breathing during the test, you should notify the scanner operator immediately.\n\nIn people with kidney problems, the dye may have harmful effects on the kidneys. In these situations, special steps may be taken to make the contrast dye safer to use.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Thoracic CT\n* CT scan - lungs\n* CT scan - chest\n\n**Images**\n\n* CT scan\n* Thyroid cancer - CT scan\n* Pulmonary nodule, solitary - CT scan\n* Lung mass, right upper lobe - CT scan\n* Bronchial cancer - CT scan\n* Lung mass, right lung - CT scan\n* Lung nodule, right lower lung - CT scan\n* Lung with squamous cell cancer - CT scan\n* Vertebra, thoracic (mid back)\n* Normal lung anatomy\n* Thoracic organs\n\n**References**\n\n* Jokerst CE, Gotway MB.

You can wear ear plugs to help reduce the noise.\n*   An intercom in the room allows you to speak to someone at any time.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nA chest MRI provides detailed pictures of tissues within the chest area. It may be done to:\n\n*   Provide an alternative to angiography, or avoid repeated exposure to radiation\n*   Clarify findings from earlier x-rays or CT scans\n*   Diagnose abnormal growths in the chest\n*   Evaluate blood flow\n*   Show lymph nodes and blood vessels\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA normal result means your chest area appears normal.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAn abnormal chest MRI may be due to various conditions, including:\n\n*   A tear in the wall, an abnormal widening or ballooning, or narrowing of the aorta\n*   Other abnormal changes of the major blood vessels in the lungs or chest\n*   Buildup of blood or fluid around the heart (pericardial effusion) or the lungs (pleural effusion)\n*   Lung cancer or cancer that has spread to the lungs from elsewhere in the body\n\n**Risks**\n\nMRI uses no radiation. The most common type of contrast (dye) used is gadolinium, which is very safe. However, it can be harmful to people with kidney problems who need dialysis.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nCurrently, MRI is not considered a valuable tool for spotting or monitoring slight changes in lung tissue. The lungs contain mostly air and are hard to image. CT scan tends to be better for monitoring these changes.\n\nDisadvantages of MRI include:\n\n*   High cost\n*   Long length of the scan\n*   Sensitivity to movement\n\n---\n\n**Chest MRI**\n\nA chest MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan is an imaging test that uses powerful magnetic fields and radio waves to create pictures of the chest (thoracic area).

You may be told to hold your breath for short periods.\n* Some exams require a special dye called contrast. The dye is usually given before the test through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. The dye helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly. A blood test to measure your kidney function may be done before the test. This is to make sure your kidneys are healthy enough to filter the contrast.\n\nDuring the MRI, the person who operates the machine will watch you from another room. The test most often lasts 30 to 60 minutes, but it may take longer.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\n* You may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan.\n* Tell your health care provider if you are claustrophobic (afraid of closed spaces). You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious. Your provider may suggest an open MRI, in which the machine is not as close to your body.\n* Before the test, tell your provider if you have:\n\t+ Brain aneurysm clips\n\t+ Artificial heart valves\n\t+ Heart defibrillator or pacemaker\n\t+ Inner ear (cochlear) implants\n\t+ Kidney disease or are on dialysis (you may not be able to receive contrast)\n\t+ Recently placed artificial joints\n\t+ Vascular stents\n\t+ Worked with sheet metal in the past (you may need tests to check for metal pieces in your eyes)\n\nThe MRI contains strong magnets, so metal objects are not allowed into the room with the MRI scanner. This is because there is a risk that they will be drawn from your body toward the scanner. Examples of metal objects you will need to remove are:\n\n* Pens, pocket knives, and eyeglasses\n* Items such as jewelry, watches, credit cards, and hearing aids\n* Pins, hairpins, and metal zippers\n* Removable dental work\n\nSome of the newer medical devices described above are MRI compatible, so the radiologist needs to check the device manufacturer to determine if an MRI is possible.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\n* An MRI exam causes no pain. If you have trouble lying still or are very nervous, you may be given medicine to relax. Too much movement can blur MRI images and cause errors when the radiologist or provider looks at the images.\n* The table may be hard or cold, but you can ask for a blanket or pillow. The machine produces loud thumping and humming noises when turned on. You can wear ear plugs to help reduce the noise.\n* An intercom in the room allows you to speak to someone at any time. Some MRIs have televisions and special headphones that you can use to help the time pass.\n* There is no recovery time, unless you were given a medicine to relax. After an MRI scan, you can resume your normal diet, activity, and medicines.\n\n---\n\n**Chest MRI**\n\n**What is a Chest MRI?**\n\nA chest MRI provides detailed pictures of tissues within the chest area.\n\n**Why is a Chest MRI Performed?**\n\nA chest MRI may be done to:\n\n* Provide an alternative to angiography, or avoid repeated exposure to radiation\n* Clarify findings from earlier x-rays or CT scans\n* Diagnose abnormal growths in the chest\n* Evaluate blood flow\n* Show lymph nodes and blood vessels\n* Show the structures of the chest from many angles\n* See if cancer in the chest has spread to other areas of the body (this is called staging -- it helps guide future treatment and follow-up, and gives you an idea of what to expect in the future)\n* Detect tumors, especially in the middle part of the chest (mediastinum)\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA normal result means your chest area appears normal.\n\n**Abnormal Results**\n\nAn abnormal chest MRI may be due to:\n\n* A tear in the wall, an abnormal widening or ballooning, or narrowing of the aorta, the major artery carrying blood out of the heart\n* Other abnormal changes of the major blood vessels in the lungs or chest\n* Buildup of blood or fluid around the heart (pericardial effusion) or the lungs (pleural effusion)\n* Lung cancer or cancer that has spread to the lungs from elsewhere in the body\n* Cancer or tumors of the heart\n* Cancer or tumors of the chest, such as a thymus tumor\n* Disease in which the heart muscle becomes weakened, stretched, or has another structural problem (cardiomyopathy)\n* Damage to, and widening of the large airways of the lungs (bronchiectasis)\n* Enlarged lymph nodes\n* Infection of the heart tissue or heart valve\n* Esophageal cancer\n* Lymphoma in the chest\n* Birth defects of the heart\n* Tumors, nodules, or cysts in the chest\n\n**Risks**\n\nMRI uses no radiation. To date, no side effects from the magnetic fields and radio waves have been reported.\n\nThe most common type of contrast (dye) used is gadolinium. It is very safe. Allergic reactions to the substance rarely occur. However, gadolinium can be harmful to people with kidney problems who need dialysis. If you have kidney problems, tell your provider before the test.\n\nThe strong magnetic fields created during an MRI can cause heart pacemakers and other implants not to work as well. It can also cause a piece of metal inside your body to move or shift.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nCurrently, MRI is not considered a valuable tool for spotting or monitoring slight changes in lung tissue.

    "content": "**Chest Radiation - Discharge**\n\nWhen you have radiation treatment for cancer, your body goes through changes. Follow your health care provider's instructions on how to care for yourself at home. Use the information below as a reminder.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nAbout 2 weeks after your first treatment:\n\n* It may be hard to swallow, or swallowing may hurt.\n* Your throat may feel dry or scratchy.\n* You may develop a cough.\n* Your skin over the treated area may turn red, start to peel, get dark, or it may itch.\n* Your body hair may fall out, but only in the area or region being treated. You will not lose all the hair on your body. When your hair grows back, it may be different than before.\n* You may develop a fever, more mucus when you cough, or feel more out of breath.\n\nFor weeks to months after radiation treatment, you may notice shortness of breath. You are more likely to notice this when you are active. Contact your provider if you develop this symptom.\n\n**Skin Care**\n\nWhen you have radiation treatment, color markings are drawn on your skin. Do not remove them. These show where to aim the radiation. If they come off, do not redraw them. Tell your provider instead.\n\nTo take care of the treatment area:\n\n* Wash gently with lukewarm water only. Don't scrub.\n* Use a mild soap that doesn't dry out your skin.\n* Pat your skin dry.\n* Don't use lotions, ointments, makeup, perfumed powders, or any other perfumed products on this area. Ask your provider what is OK to use.\n* Keep the area that is being treated out of direct sunlight.\n* Don't scratch or rub your skin.\n* Don't put heating pads or ice bags on the treatment area.\n* Wear loose-fitting clothing.\n\nTell your provider if you have any breaks or openings in your skin.\n\n**Other Self-care**\n\nYou will likely feel tired after a few days. If so:\n\n* Don't try to do too much in a day. You probably will not be able to do everything you are used to doing.\n* Try to get more sleep at night. Rest during the day when you can.\n* Take a few weeks off work, or work less.\n\nYou need to eat enough protein and calories to keep your weight up.\n\nTo make eating easier:\n\n* Choose foods that you like.\n* Try foods with gravy, broths, or sauces. They will be easier to chew and swallow.\n* Eat small meals and eat more often during the day.\n* Cut your food into small pieces.\n* Ask your provider or dentist if artificial saliva might help you.\n\nDrink at least 8 to 12 cups (2 to 3 liters) of liquid each day, not including coffee or tea, or other drinks that have caffeine in them.\n\nDon't drink alcohol or eat spicy foods, acidic foods, or foods that are very hot or cold. These will bother your throat.\n\nIf pills are hard to swallow, try crushing them and mixing them with ice cream or other soft food. Ask your provider or pharmacist before crushing your medicines. Some medicines do not work when crushed.\n\n**Watch out for these signs of lymphedema (fluid buildup) in your arm:**\n\n* You have a feeling of tightness in your arm.\n* Rings on your fingers get tighter.\n* Your arm feels weak.\n* You have pain, aching, or heaviness in your arm.\n* Your arm is red, swollen, or there are signs of infection.\n\nAsk your provider about exercises you can do to keep your arm moving freely.\n\n---\n\n**Chest Radiation - Discharge**\n\nWhen you have radiation treatment for cancer, your body goes through changes.

Don't worry, it's normal! Just remember to take it easy and follow these tips:\n\n*   **Eat enough protein and calories**: You need to keep your weight up, so make sure you're eating enough nutritious food.\n*   **Drink plenty of fluids**: Aim for at least 8 to 12 cups (2 to 3 liters) of liquid each day, not including coffee or tea. This will help keep your throat moist and comfortable.\n*   **Avoid spicy foods and drinks with caffeine**: These can irritate your throat and make it harder to swallow. Stick to soft, easy-to-chew foods like ice cream or yogurt if you need to take pills.\n*   **Watch out for lymphedema**: If you notice any of these signs in your arm, such as tightness, swelling, pain, or weakness, talk to your provider about exercises you can do to keep your arm moving freely.\n\n**Dry, Sore Throat, or Cough**\n\nTry using a humidifier or vaporizer in your bedroom or main living area to add moisture to the air. And remember:\n\n*   **Don't smoke**: This is especially important if you're experiencing a dry, sore throat or cough.\n*   **Suck on sugar-free candy**: This can help stimulate saliva production and make swallowing easier.\n*   **Gargle with salt water**: Mix 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda in 8 ounces of warm water and gargle several times a day. Just be sure to avoid store-bought mouthwashes or lozenges.\n\n**Follow-up Care**\n\nYour provider may check your blood counts regularly, especially if the radiation treatment area is large. This is just a precaution to make sure everything is okay.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nChest radiation can also be referred to as:\n\n*   Radiation - chest - discharge\n*   Cancer - chest radiation\n*   Lymphoma - chest radiation\n*   Thoracic radiation - lung cancer\n\n**References**\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about chest radiation, check out these references:\n\n*   Doroshow JH.

    "title": "Chest tube insertion: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia",
    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002947.htm",
    "content": "**Chest Tube Insertion**\n\nA chest tube is a hollow, flexible tube placed into the chest to act as a drain.\n\n**Description**\n\nWhen your chest tube is inserted, you will lie on your side or sit partly upright, with one arm over your head. You may receive medicine through a vein (intravenous, or IV) to make you relaxed and sleepy. Your skin will be cleaned at the site of the planned insertion. The chest tube is inserted through a 1-inch (2.5 centimeters) cut in your skin between your ribs. Then it is guided to the correct spot.\n\n**Procedure**\n\nThe tube is connected to a special canister. Suction is often used to help it drain. Other times, gravity alone will allow it to drain. A stitch (suture) and tape keep the tube in place. After your chest tube insertion, you will have a chest x-ray to make sure the tube is in the right place.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nChest tubes are used to treat conditions that cause a lung to collapse, such as:\n\n* Surgery or trauma in the chest\n* Air leaks from inside the lung into the chest (pneumothorax)\n* Fluid buildup in the chest (called a pleural effusion) due to bleeding into the chest, buildup of fatty fluid, abscess or pus buildup in the lung or the chest, or heart failure\n* A tear in the esophagus\n\n**Risks**\n\nSome risks from the insertion procedure are:\n\n* Bleeding or infection where the tube is inserted\n* Improper placement of the tube (into the tissues, abdomen, or too far in the chest)\n* Injury to the lung\n* Injury to organs near the tube, such as the spleen, liver, stomach, or diaphragm\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou will most likely stay in the hospital until your chest tube is removed. In some cases, a person may go home with a chest tube. While the chest tube is in place, your health care provider will carefully check for air leaks, breathing problems, and if you need oxygen. They will also make sure the tube stays in place.\n\n**What You Will Need to Do**\n\n* Breathe deeply and cough often (your nurse will teach you how to do this). Deep breathing and coughing will help re-expand your lung and help with drainage.\n* Be careful there are no kinks in your tube. The drainage system should always sit upright and be placed below your lungs. If it is not, the fluid or air will not drain and your lungs can't re-expand.\n\n**Get Help Right Away If**\n\n* Your chest tube comes out or shifts\n* The tubes become disconnected\n* You suddenly have a harder time breathing or have more pain\n\n---\n\n**Chest Tube Insertion**\n\nA chest tube is a hollow, flexible tube placed into the chest to drain blood, fluid, or air from around the lungs, heart, or esophagus.\n\n**What You Will Need to Do**\n\n* Breathe deeply and cough often (your nurse will teach you how to do this). Deep breathing and coughing will help re-expand your lung and help with drainage.\n* Be careful there are no kinks in your tube. The drainage system should always sit upright and be placed below your lungs. If it is not, the fluid or air will not drain and your lungs can't re-expand.\n\n**Get Help Right Away if:**\n\n* Your chest tube comes out or shifts.\n* The tubes become disconnected.\n* You suddenly have a harder time breathing or have more pain.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook depends on the reason a chest tube is inserted. Pneumothorax most often improves, but sometimes surgery is needed to correct the underlying problem. This may be performed through a scope or may require a large incision depending on your underlying condition. In cases of infection, the person improves when the infection is treated, although scarring of the lining of the lung can sometimes occur (fibrothorax). This may require surgery to correct the problem.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Chest drainage tube insertion\n* Insertion of tube into chest\n* Tube thoracostomy\n* Pericardial drain\n\n**Description**\n\nWhen your chest tube is inserted, you will lie on your side or sit partly upright, with one arm over your head. Sometimes, you will receive medicine through a vein (intravenous, or IV) to make you relaxed and sleepy. Your skin will be cleaned at the site of the planned insertion. The chest tube is inserted through a 1-inch (2.5 centimeters) cut in your skin between your ribs. Then it is guided to the correct spot. The tube is connected to a special canister. Suction is often used to help it drain. Other times, gravity alone will allow it to drain. A stitch (suture) and tape keep the tube in place.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nChest tubes are used to treat conditions that cause a lung to collapse. Some of these conditions are:\n\n* Surgery or trauma in the chest\n* Air leaks from inside the lung into the chest (pneumothorax)\n* Fluid buildup in the chest (called a pleural effusion) due to bleeding into the chest, buildup of fatty fluid, abscess or pus buildup in the lung or the chest, or heart failure\n* A tear in the esophagus (the tube that allows food to go from the mouth to the stomach)\n\n**Risks**\n\nSome risks from the insertion procedure are:\n\n* Bleeding or infection where the tube is inserted\n* Improper placement of the tube (into the tissues, abdomen, or too far in the chest)\n* Injury to the lung\n* Injury to organs near the tube, such as the spleen, liver, stomach, or diaphragm\n\n---\n\n**Chest Tube Insertion**\n\n**What to Expect (Procedure)**\n\nA chest tube is inserted through a small incision in the skin between your ribs. The procedure takes about an hour and is usually done under local anesthesia.\n\n**Some Risks from the Insertion Procedure Are:**\n\n*   Bleeding or infection at the insertion site\n*   Pneumonia or other lung problems if the tube is not properly placed\n*   Damage to the lung or surrounding tissues during the procedure\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou will most likely stay in the hospital until your chest tube is removed. In some cases, a person may go home with a chest tube.\n\nWhile the chest tube is in place, your health care provider will carefully check for air leaks, breathing problems, and if you need oxygen. They will also make sure the tube stays in place. Your provider will tell you whether it is OK to get up and walk around or sit in a chair.\n\n**What You Will Need to Do:**\n\n*   Breathe deeply and cough often (your nurse will teach you how to do this). Deep breathing and coughing will help re-expand your lung and help with drainage.\n*   Be careful there are no kinks in your tube. The drainage system should always sit upright and be placed below your lungs. If it is not, the fluid or air will not drain and your lungs can't re-expand.\n\n**Get Help Right Away If:**\n\n*   Your chest tube comes out or shifts.\n*   The tubes become disconnected.\n*   You suddenly have a harder time breathing or have more pain.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook depends on the reason a chest tube is inserted. Pneumothorax most often improves, but sometimes surgery is needed to correct the underlying problem. This may be performed through a scope or may require a large incision depending on your underlying condition. In cases of infection, the person improves when the infection is treated, although scarring of the lining of the lung can sometimes occur (fibrothorax). This may require surgery to correct the problem.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n*   Chest drainage tube insertion\n*   Insertion of tube into chest\n*   Tube thoracostomy\n*   Pericardial drain\n\n---\n\n**Chest Tube Insertion**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Placement, Care, and Removal**\n\nChest tube placement, care, and removal are crucial aspects of managing patients with chest injuries or disorders.

With CM, brain tissue extends into the spinal canal. It can happen when part of the skull is too small, which pushes the brain tissue down.\n\nThere are several types of CM. One type often happens in children who have neural tube defects. Some types cause no symptoms and don't need treatment. If you have symptoms, they may include:\n\n* Neck pain\n* Balance problems\n* Numbness or other abnormal feelings in the arms or legs\n* Dizziness\n* Vision problems\n* Difficulty swallowing\n* Poor hand coordination\n\nDoctors diagnose CM using imaging tests. Medicines may ease some symptoms, such as pain.

The VIS is available in multiple languages, including English, Ukrainian, Urdu, Vietnamese, and Yiddish.\n\n**Multiple Language Support**\n\nThe CDC recognizes the importance of providing health information in languages other than English to ensure that all individuals have access to accurate and reliable information about vaccination. The availability of the varicella vaccine in multiple languages reflects this commitment to cultural sensitivity and linguistic inclusivity.\n\n---\n\n**Chickenpox**\n\n\\n\\n* **English:** [Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) -- Varicella (Chickenpox) Vaccine: What You Need to Know](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/varicella.html)\n* **Yiddish:** [Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) -- Varicella (Chickenpox) Vaccine: What You Need to Know](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/varicella-yid.html)\n\n\\n\\n**MMRV Vaccine (Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella)**\n\n\\n\\n* **English:** [Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) -- MMRV Vaccine (Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella): What You Need to Know](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/mmrv.html)\n* **Yiddish:** [Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) -- MMRV Vaccine (Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella): What You Need to Know](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/mmrv-yid.html)\n\n\\n\\n**Varicella (Chickenpox) Vaccine**\n\n\\n\\n* **English:** [Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) -- Varicella (Chickenpox) Vaccine: What You Need to Know](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/varicella.html)\n* **Yiddish:** [Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) -- Varicella (Chickenpox) Vaccine: What You Need to Know](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/varicella-yid.html)\n\nNote: I removed the code blocks, ads, disclaimers, and standalone URLs as per your instructions.

    "content": "**Chickenpox and Shingles Tests**\n\n**What are Chickenpox and Shingles Tests?**\n\nChickenpox and shingles tests check to see if you are or have ever been infected with the varicella zoster virus (VZV). VZV is a type of herpes virus that causes chickenpox and shingles. This virus is also known as human herpesvirus 3 (HHV-3) and the herpes zoster virus.\n\n**Types of Tests**\n\nThere are different types of tests to check for VZV:\n\n*   A PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test, which looks for genetic material from VZV in a sample.\n*   A viral culture test, where cells from a swab test sample are grown in a lab and then checked for VZV.\n*   A direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test, which involves using a fluorescent dye and a special microscope to look for VZV in the sample.\n*   An antibody test, which is a blood test that looks for VZV antibodies.\n\n**Which Tests and Samples Are Used?**\n\nThe type of test and sample used depends on the person and their symptoms. For example, a PCR test may be used to confirm a VZV infection, while an antibody test may be used to check for immunity to the virus.\n\n**What Are They Used For?**\n\nHealth care providers can usually diagnose chickenpox or shingles with a visual examination. But in some cases, your provider may also order a chickenpox or shingles test to confirm the diagnosis. These tests are also sometimes ordered to check for immunity to the varicella zoster virus (VZV).\n\n**Who May Need a Chickenpox or Shingles Test?**\n\nYou may need a chickenpox or shingles test if you are at higher risk of complications, are not immune to VZV, and/or have symptoms of infection. This includes:\n\n*   During pregnancy\n*   Infants\n*   Teen and adults with symptoms of chickenpox\n*   People who have weakened immune systems\n\n**What Happens During Chickenpox and Shingles Testing?**\n\nYou will need to provide a sample of blood from your vein or from the fluid in one of your blisters. Blood tests check for antibodies to the VZV, while blister tests check for the virus itself.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a blood or blister test.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nAfter a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There is no risk to having a blister test.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nIf you have symptoms and your test results show VZV antibodies or the virus itself, it's likely you have chickenpox or shingles. Your diagnosis of either chickenpox or shingles will depend on your age and specific symptoms.\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About Chickenpox and Shingles Tests?**\n\nThe best way to prevent chickenpox is to get the chickenpox vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the chickenpox vaccine for children, teens, and adults who never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine.\n\n**Learn More About Laboratory Tests, Reference Ranges, and Understanding Results**\n\nTo learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results, you can visit our website at [www.medlineplus.gov](http://www.medlineplus.gov).\n\n---\n\n**Chickenpox and Shingles Tests**\n\n**What are chickenpox and shingles tests?**\n\nChickenpox and shingles tests check to see if you are or have ever been infected with the varicella zoster virus (VZV). VZV is a type of herpes virus that causes chickenpox and shingles. This virus is also known as human herpesvirus 3 (HHV-3) and the herpes zoster virus.\n\n**How do these tests work?**\n\nTesting for VZV involves checking for VZV in a blood, fluid, or tissue sample. There are different types of tests to do this:\n\n*   A PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test. This test looks for genetic material from VZV in a sample.\n*   A viral culture test. For this test, cells from a swab test sample are grown in a lab and then checked for VZV.\n*   A direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test. This test is also done on a swab test sample that is sent to a lab.\n*   An antibody test. This is a blood test that looks for VZV antibodies.\n\n**Which tests and samples are used depends on the person and their symptoms.**\n\n**What are these tests used for?**\n\nHealth care providers can usually diagnose chickenpox or shingles with a visual examination. But in some cases, your provider may also order a chickenpox or shingles test to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nThese tests are also sometimes ordered to check for immunity to the varicella zoster virus (VZV). You have immunity if you've had chickenpox before or have had the chickenpox vaccine. When you have immunity, it means you can't get chickenpox. But you can still get shingles later in life.\n\nThese tests may be done on people who are at higher risk of complications from VZV and either don't have immunity or don't know if they have immunity. People who are at higher risk of complications include:\n\n*   During pregnancy\n*   Infants\n*   Teen and adults with symptoms of chickenpox\n*   People who have weakened immune systems, for example, because they:\n    *   Have HIV, cancer, or another condition that weakens their immune system\n    *   Have had an organ transplant\n    *   Are taking medicines that weaken the immune system, such as chemotherapy and steroids\n\n**Why do I need a chickenpox or shingles test?**\n\nYou may need a chickenpox or shingles test if you are at higher risk of complications, are not immune to VZV, and/or have symptoms of infection.\n\nContact your provider right away if you have symptoms of chickenpox or shingles. Some of the symptoms of chickenpox and shingles are similar, but they are not the same illness. Common symptoms for both include:\n\n*   A red, blistering rash\n*   Fever\n*   Headache\n*   Sore throat\n\nWith chickenpox, the rash first appears on the chest, back, and face. Then it spreads over the entire body, including inside the mouth, eyelids, or genital area. It usually takes about 1 week for all of the blisters to become scabs.\n\nOne to two days before you get the rash, you may have other typical symptoms, such as:\n\n*   Fever\n*   Tiredness\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Headache\n\nSome people who have been vaccinated against chickenpox can still get the disease. But they often have milder symptoms and are sick for a shorter period of time than people who are not vaccinated.\n\nBefore getting a rash, people with shingles may first have pain, itching, or tingling in the area where the rash later develops. This can happen several days before the rash appears. They may also have a fever at this time.\n\nThe rash that develops is painful and itchy, and it often develops on just one side of the body or face, and in a small area. The most common place for shingles to occur is in a band around one side of the waistline. Shingles on the face can affect the eye and cause vision loss. Rarely, the rash can be more widespread on the body and look similar to a chickenpox rash. This usually happens in people with weakened immune systems.\n\nThe rash consists of blisters that typically scab over in 7 to 10 days and fully clear up within 2 to 4 weeks.\n\nOther symptoms of shingles can include:\n\n*   Headache\n*   Chills\n*   Upset stomach\n\n---\n\n**Chickenpox and Shingles Tests**\n\n**What is Chickenpox?**\n\nChickenpox is a highly contagious illness caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It's characterized by a rash of blisters that typically scab over in 7 to 10 days and fully clear up within 2 to 4 weeks. Other symptoms include:\n\n* Headache\n* Chills\n* Upset stomach\n\n**What is Shingles?**\n\nShingles is a viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It's characterized by a painful and itchy rash that typically develops on one side of the body or face. The rash consists of blisters that typically scab over in 7 to 10 days and fully clear up within 2 to 4 weeks.\n\n**Who Needs a Chickenpox or Shingles Test?**\n\nYou may need a chickenpox or shingles test if you are at higher risk of complications, are not immune to VZV, and/or have symptoms of infection. You can't catch shingles from another person, but the shingles virus (VZV) can spread and cause chickenpox in someone who doesn't have immunity.\n\n**What Happens During a Chickenpox or Shingles Test?**\n\nYou will need to provide a sample of blood from your vein or from the fluid in one of your blisters. Blood tests check for antibodies to the VZV, while blister tests check for the virus itself. The test is quick and usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a blood or blister test.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nAfter a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There is no risk to having a blister test.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nIf you have symptoms and your test results show VZV antibodies or the virus itself, it's likely you have chickenpox or shingles. Your diagnosis of either chickenpox or shingles will depend on your age and specific symptoms. If you don't have symptoms and your results show antibodies to the virus or the virus itself, you either had chickenpox at one point or received the chickenpox vaccine.\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About Chickenpox and Shingles Tests?**\n\nThe best way to prevent chickenpox is to get the chickenpox vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the chickenpox vaccine for children, teens, and adults who never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine.\n\nThere is also a vaccine for shingles called Shingrix. The CDC recommends that healthy adults age 50 and older get two doses of Shingrix, separated by 2 to 6 months. Shingrix is also recommended for adults 19 years and older who have weakened immune systems due to disease or medicines.\n\nSince you can get shingles more than once, you should get the vaccine even if you've already had shingles.\n\n---\n\n**Chickenpox and Shingles Tests**\n\nSince you can get shingles more than once, you should get the vaccine even if you've already had shingles.\n\nA different shingles vaccine called Zostavax is no longer available in the United States. If you had a Zostavax vaccine in the past, you should still get vaccinated with Shingrix. Talk to your provider about the best time to get Shingrix.\n\n**Preventing Chickenpox**\n\nThe best way to prevent chickenpox is to get the chickenpox vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the chickenpox vaccine for children, teens, and adults who never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine:\n\n*   People 13 years of age and older who have never had chickenpox and haven't had a chickenpox vaccine should get two doses, at least 28 days apart\n\n**Shingles Vaccine**\n\nThere is also a vaccine for shingles. It's called Shingrix. The CDC recommends that healthy adults age 50 and older get two doses of Shingrix, separated by 2 to 6 months. Shingrix is also recommended for adults 19 years and older who have weakened immune systems due to disease or medicines.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Internet].

    "content": "**Chickenpox**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Chickenpox?**\n\nChickenpox is a viral infection that causes very itchy blisters all over the body. It was more common in the past, but thanks to the chickenpox vaccine, the illness is now rare.\n\n**Causes of Chickenpox**\n\nThe varicella-zoster virus is responsible for causing chickenpox. This virus is part of the herpesvirus family and also causes shingles in adults.\n\n**How is Chickenpox Spread?**\n\nChickenpox can be spread very easily to others from 1 to 2 days before blisters appear until all the blisters have crusted over. You may get chickenpox:\n\n*   From touching the fluids from a chickenpox blister\n*   If someone with the disease coughs or sneezes near you\n\n**Who is Most Affected by Chickenpox?**\n\nMost cases of chickenpox occur in children younger than age 10. The disease is most often mild, although serious complications may occur. Adults and older children get sicker than younger children in most cases.\n\n**Symptoms of Chickenpox**\n\nBefore the rash appears, most children with chickenpox have the following symptoms:\n\n*   Fever\n*   Headache\n*   Stomach ache\n\nThe chickenpox rash occurs about 10 to 21 days after coming into contact with someone who had the disease. In most cases, a child will develop 250 to 500 small, itchy, fluid-filled blisters over red spots on the skin.\n\n**Treatment and Prevention of Chickenpox**\n\nTreatment involves keeping the person as comfortable as possible. Here are things to try:\n\n*   Avoid scratching or rubbing the itchy areas. Keep fingernails short to avoid damaging the skin from scratching.\n*   Wear cool, light, loose bedclothes. Avoid wearing rough clothing, particularly wool, over an itchy area.\n*   Take lukewarm baths using little soap and rinse thoroughly. Try a skin-soothing oatmeal or cornstarch bath.\n*   Apply a soothing moisturizer after bathing to soften and cool the skin.\n*   Avoid prolonged exposure to excessive heat and humidity.\n*   Try over-the-counter oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), but be aware of possible side effects, such as drowsiness.\n*   Try over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream on itchy areas.\n\nMedicines that fight the chickenpox virus are available, but not given to everyone. To work well, the medicine should be started within the first 24 hours of the rash.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you think that your child has chickenpox or if your child is over 12 months of age and has not been vaccinated against chickenpox.\n\n**Prevention of Chickenpox**\n\nA vaccine to prevent chickenpox is part of a child's routine vaccine schedule. The vaccine often prevents the chickenpox disease completely or makes the illness very mild.\n\n---\n\n**Chickenpox**\n\nChickenpox is a viral infection in which a person develops very itchy blisters all over the body.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, a member of the herpesvirus family that also causes shingles in adults.\n*   The virus can be spread easily to others from 1 to 2 days before blisters appear until all the blisters have crusted over.\n\n**How It's Spread**\n\nYou may get chickenpox:\n\n    From touching the fluids from a chickenpox blister\n    If someone with the disease coughs or sneezes near you\n\n**Who Gets It Most Often**\n\nMost cases of chickenpox occur in children younger than age 10. The disease is most often mild, although serious complications may occur. Adults and older children get sicker than younger children in most cases.\n\n**Protection for Young Children**\n\nChildren whose mothers have had chickenpox or have received the chickenpox vaccine are not very likely to catch it before they are 1 year old. If they do catch chickenpox, they often have mild cases. This is because antibodies from their mothers' blood help protect them.\n\n**Severe Symptoms**\n\nSevere chickenpox symptoms are more common in children whose immune system does not work well.\n\n**Symptoms Before the Rash Appears**\n\nMost children with chickenpox have the following symptoms before the rash appears:\n\n*   Fever\n*   Headache\n*   Stomach ache\n\n**The Chickenpox Rash**\n\nThe chickenpox rash occurs about 10 to 21 days after coming into contact with someone who had the disease.

This is because antibodies from their mothers' blood help protect them.\n\n**Severe Cases**\n\n*   Severe chickenpox symptoms are more common in children whose immune system does not work well.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Most children with chickenpox have the following symptoms before the rash appears:\n    *   Fever\n    *   Headache\n    *   Stomach ache\n\n**The Rash**\n\n*   The chickenpox rash occurs about 10 to 21 days after coming into contact with someone who had the disease.\n*   In most cases, a child will develop 250 to 500 small, itchy, fluid-filled blisters over red spots on the skin.\n\n**Treatment**\n\n*   Treatment involves keeping the person as comfortable as possible. Here are things to try:\n    *   Avoid scratching or rubbing the itchy areas. Keep fingernails short to avoid damaging the skin from scratching.\n    *   Wear cool, light, loose bedclothes. Avoid wearing rough clothing, particularly wool, over an itchy area.\n    *   Take lukewarm baths using little soap and rinse thoroughly. Try a skin-soothing oatmeal or cornstarch bath.\n    *   Apply a soothing moisturizer after bathing to soften and cool the skin.\n    *   Avoid prolonged exposure to excessive heat and humidity.\n    *   Try over-the-counter oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), but be aware of possible side effects, such as drowsiness.\n    *   Try over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream on itchy areas.\n\n**Medicines**\n\n*   Medicines that fight the chickenpox virus are available, but not given to everyone. To work well, the medicine should be started within the first 24 hours of the rash.\n\n---\n\n**Chickenpox: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 4/5)**\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment involves keeping the person as comfortable as possible.

To work well, the medicine should be started within the first 24 hours of the rash.\n\nAntiviral medicines are not very often prescribed to otherwise healthy children who do not have severe symptoms. Adults and teens, who are at risk for more severe symptoms, may benefit from antiviral medicine if it is given early.\n\nAntiviral medicine may be very important for those who have skin conditions (such as eczema or recent sunburn), lung conditions (such as asthma), or who have recently taken steroids.\n\nSome providers also give antiviral medicines to people in the same household who also develop chickenpox, because they will most often develop more severe symptoms.\n\nDO NOT give aspirin or ibuprofen to someone who may have chickenpox. Use of aspirin has been associated with a serious condition called Reye syndrome. Ibuprofen has been associated with more severe secondary infections. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be used.\n\nA child with chickenpox should not return to school or play with other children until all chickenpox sores have crusted over or dried out. Adults should follow this same rule while considering when to return to work or be around others.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nIn most cases, a person recovers without complications.\n\nOnce you have had chickenpox, the virus often remains dormant or asleep in your body for your lifetime. About 1 in 10 adults will have shingles when the virus re-emerges during a period of stress.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nRarely, infection of the brain has occurred. Other problems may include:\n\n*   Reye syndrome\n*   Infection of the heart muscle\n*   Pneumonia\n*   Joint pain or swelling\n\nCerebellar ataxia may appear during the recovery phase or later. This involves a very unsteady walk.\n\nWomen who get chickenpox during pregnancy can pass the infection to the developing baby. Newborns are at risk for severe infection.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you think that your child has chickenpox or if your child is over 12 months of age and has not been vaccinated against chickenpox.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nBecause chickenpox is airborne and spreads very easily, even before the rash appears, it is hard to avoid.\n\nA vaccine to prevent chickenpox is part of a child's routine vaccine schedule.\n\nThe vaccine often prevents the chickenpox disease completely or makes the illness very mild.\n\n---\n\n**Chickenpox**\n\nBecause chickenpox is airborne and spreads very easily, even before the rash appears, it is hard to avoid.\n\n**Prevention with Vaccine**\n\nA vaccine to prevent chickenpox is part of a child's routine vaccine schedule. The vaccine often prevents the chickenpox disease completely or makes the illness very mild.\n\n**High Risk Cases**\n\nTalk to your provider if you think your child might be at high risk for complications and might have been exposed. Taking preventive steps right away may be important.

Their bite causes severe itching.\n\n**Causes**\n\nChiggers are found in certain outdoor areas, such as:\n\n* Berry patches\n* Tall grass and weeds\n* Edges of woodlands\n\nChiggers bite humans around the waist, ankles, or in warm skin folds. Bites commonly occur in the summer and fall months.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe main symptoms of chigger bites are:\n\n* Severe itching\n* Red pimple-like bumps or hives\n\nItching usually occurs several hours after the chiggers attach to the skin. The bite is painless.\n\nA skin rash may appear on the parts of the body that were exposed to the sun. It may stop where the underwear meets the legs. This is often a clue that the rash is due to chigger bites.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider can usually diagnose chiggers by examining the rash. You'll likely be asked about your outdoor activity. A special magnifying scope may be used to find the chiggers on the skin. This helps confirm the diagnosis.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to stop the itching. Antihistamines and corticosteroid creams or lotions may be helpful. Antibiotics are not necessary unless you develop a skin infection.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nA secondary infection may occur from scratching.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if the rash itches very badly, or if your symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nAvoid outdoor areas that you know are contaminated with chiggers.

    "content": "**Chikungunya Virus**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Chikungunya?**\n\nChikungunya is a virus passed to humans by the bite of infected mosquitoes. Symptoms include fever and severe joint pain. The name chikungunya (pronounced \"chik-en-gun-ye\") is an African word meaning \"bent over in pain.\"\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Where is Chikungunya Found?**\n\nBefore 2013, the virus was found only in Africa, Asia, Europe, and lands in the Indian and Pacific oceans. In late 2013, outbreaks occurred for the first time in the Americas in the Caribbean Islands.\n\nIn the Americas, local transmission of the disease has been found in 44 countries and territories. This means that mosquitoes in those areas have the virus and are spreading it to humans.\n\nSince 2014, the disease has been found in travelers coming to the United States from affected areas in the Americas. Local transmission has occurred in Florida, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Does Chikungunya Spread?**\n\nMosquitoes spread the virus to humans. Mosquitoes pick up the virus when they feed on infected people. They spread the virus when they bite other people.\n\nThe mosquitoes that spread chikungunya are the same type that spread dengue fever, which has similar symptoms. These mosquitoes most often feed on humans during the day.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Are the Symptoms of Chikungunya?**\n\nSymptoms develop 3 to 7 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. The disease is easily spread. Most people who become infected have symptoms.\n\nThe most common symptoms are fever and joint pain. Other symptoms include:\n\n*   Headache\n*   Joint swelling\n*   Muscle pain\n*   Nausea\n*   Rash\n\nSymptoms are similar to the flu and can be severe, but usually not deadly. Most people recover in a week. Some have joint pain for months or longer. The disease can lead to death in frail older adults.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is Chikungunya Treated?**\n\nThere is no treatment for chikungunya. Like the flu virus, it has to run its course. You can take steps to help relieve symptoms:\n\n*   Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.\n*   Get plenty of rest.\n*   Take ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol) to relieve pain and fever.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When Should I Contact a Medical Professional?**\n\nCall your health care provider if you develop symptoms of chikungunya. Let your provider know if you have traveled recently in an area where the virus is spread. Your provider may do a blood test to check for the disease.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How Can I Prevent Chikungunya?**\n\nThere is no vaccine to protect against chikungunya. The best way to avoid getting the virus is to avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes. If you are in an area where there is local transmission of the virus, take these steps to protect yourself:\n\n*   When it is not too hot, cover up with long sleeves, long pants, socks, and a hat.\n*   Use clothing coated with permethrin.\n*   Use insect repellent with DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or para-menthane-diol. When using sunscreen, apply insect repellant after you apply sunscreen.\n*   Sleep in a room with air conditioning or with windows with screens. Check screens for large holes.\n*   Remove standing water from any outside containers such as buckets, flower pots, and birdbaths.\n*   If sleeping outside, sleep under a mosquito net.\n\nIf you get chikungunya, try to avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes so you do not pass the virus to others.\n\n---\n\n**Chikungunya Virus**\n\n\\n\\n**Where Chikungunya is Found**\n\nBefore 2013, the virus was found only in Africa, Asia, Europe, and lands in the Indian and Pacific oceans.

They may rebel. They also look outward - to their friends, who are usually of the same sex. Peer approval becomes very important.
