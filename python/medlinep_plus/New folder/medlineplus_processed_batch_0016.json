    "content": "**Are Facial Dimples Determined by Genetics?**\n\nFacial dimples, those adorable indentations on the cheeks, tend to occur in families and are assumed to be inherited. But is there really a genetic link?\n\n**The Science Behind Dimples**\n\nDimples are usually considered a dominant genetic trait, meaning that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause dimples. However, some researchers argue that there's no proof dimples are inherited. Little research has been done to explore the genetics of dimples, and it's still unknown which gene or genes may be involved.\n\n**A Brief History of Dimples**\n\nDimples have been around for centuries, and their appearance can vary greatly from person to person. Some people have dimples in both cheeks, while others have them only on one side. Babies often have dimples due to baby fat, which disappears as they grow older. In some cases, dimples appear later in childhood or even disappear by adolescence.\n\n**The Genetics of Dimples**\n\nDimples that resemble each other can occur in successive generations of a family. For example, a family might have siblings, parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents all sporting similar-looking dimples on both cheeks. On the other hand, some families may only see dimples in one generation.\n\n**Further Reading**\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about the genetics of dimples, check out these scientific articles:\n\n*   OMIM: Dimples, Facial (126100)\n*   Wiedemann HR.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/traits/fingerprints",
    "content": "**Are Fingertips Determined by Genetics?**\n\nEach person's fingerprints are unique, which is why they have long been used as a way to identify individuals. Surprisingly little is known about the factors that influence a person's fingerprint patterns. Like many other complex traits, studies suggest that both genetic and environmental factors play a role.\n\n**The Development of Dermatoglyphs**\n\nA person's fingerprints are based on the patterns of skin ridges (called dermatoglyphs) on the pads of the fingers. These ridges are also present on the toes, the palms of the hands, and the soles of the feet. Although the basic whorl, arch, and loop patterns may be similar, the details of the patterns are specific to each individual.\n\nDermatoglyphs develop before birth and remain the same throughout life. The ridges begin to develop during the third month of fetal development, and they are fully formed by the sixth month. The function of these ridges is not entirely clear, but they likely increase sensitivity to touch.\n\n**Genetic Factors Influencing Dermatoglyph Formation**\n\nThe basic size, shape, and spacing of dermatoglyphs appear to be influenced by genetic factors. Studies suggest that multiple genes are involved, so the inheritance pattern is not straightforward. Genes that control the development of the various layers of skin, as well as the muscles, fat, and blood vessels underneath the skin, may all play a role in determining the pattern of ridges.\n\n**Environmental Factors Influencing Dermatoglyph Formation**\n\nThe finer details of the patterns of skin ridges are influenced by other factors during fetal development, including substances taken during pregnancy and the environment inside the womb. These developmental factors cause each person's dermatoglyphs to be different from everyone else's. Even identical twins, who have the same DNA, have different fingerprints.\n\n**Rare Diseases Characterized by Abnormal or Absent Dermatoglyphs**\n\nFew genes involved in dermatoglyph formation have been identified. Rare diseases characterized by abnormal or absent dermatoglyphs provide some clues as to their genetic basis. For example, a condition known as adermatoglyphia is characterized by an absence of dermatoglyphs, sometimes with other abnormalities of the skin. Adermatoglyphia is caused by mutations in a gene called SMARCAD1. Although this gene is clearly important for the formation of dermatoglyphs, its role in their development is unclear.\n\n**Scientific Journal Articles for Further Reading**\n\n* Burger B, Fuchs D, Sprecher E, Itin P. The immigration delay disease: adermatoglyphia-inherited absence of epidermal ridges. J Am Acad Dermatol. 2011 May;64(5):974-80.\n* Nousbeck J, Burger B, Fuchs-Telem D, Pavlovsky M, Fenig S, Sarig O, Itin P, Sprecher E.

Fingerprints are unlikely to increase the friction of primate fingerpads. J Exp Biol. 2009 Jul;212(Pt 13):2016-22.\n\n---\n\n**Are Fingerprints Determined by Genetics?**\n\nFingerprints are unique to each individual, making them an effective way to identify people. Despite their importance, surprisingly little is known about the factors that influence fingerprint patterns. Research suggests that both genetic and environmental factors play a role in shaping fingerprints.\n\n**The Development of Fingerprints**\n\nDermatoglyphs, the patterns of skin ridges on our fingers, develop before birth and remain unchanged throughout life. They begin to form during the third month of fetal development and are fully formed by the sixth month. The function of these ridges is not entirely clear, but they likely increase sensitivity to touch.\n\n**Genetic Influence on Fingerprints**\n\nStudies indicate that genetic factors influence the basic size, shape, and spacing of dermatoglyphs. Multiple genes are involved, making the inheritance pattern complex. Genes controlling skin development, muscle, fat, and blood vessel formation may all contribute to determining fingerprint patterns. Environmental factors during fetal development, such as substances taken by the mother during pregnancy, also impact the finer details of fingerprint patterns.\n\n**Rare Diseases Provide Clues**\n\nRare conditions characterized by abnormal or absent dermatoglyphs offer insights into the genetic basis of fingerprint formation. Adermatoglyphia, caused by mutations in the SMARCAD1 gene, is one such condition. Although this gene is crucial for dermatoglyph development, its role remains unclear.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\nFor more information on the influence of genetics on fingerprint formation:\n\n*   The Washington State Twin Registry provides an FAQ about identical twins' fingerprints.\n*   OMIM.org offers detailed genetic information about dermatoglyphs and adermatoglyphia.",

    "title": "Are moles determined by genetics?: MedlinePlus Genetics",
    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/traits/moles",
    "content": "**Are Moles Determined by Genetics?**\n\nMoles are very common, especially in people with fair skin. They're overgrowths of skin cells called melanocytes, but the genetic factors involved in their development are not well understood.\n\n**The Genetic Factors Involved in Mole Development**\n\nAlthough moles, like tumors, are an overgrowth of cells, moles are almost always noncancerous (benign). Perhaps because most moles are benign, scientists have not studied them extensively, and not much is known about their genetics. Similar numbers of moles seem to occur on individuals of different generations of a family, so a tendency to develop moles seems to be inherited, but the inheritance pattern is not well understood.\n\n**The Relationship Between Sun Exposure and Mole Development**\n\nMost moles occur on parts of the body that are exposed to the sun (ultraviolet radiation), and the number of moles an individual has may increase after extended time in the sun. Moles usually begin to occur in childhood. These moles are called acquired melanocytic nevi (and include the subtype epidermal nevus). It is common for new moles to appear during times when hormone levels change, such as adolescence and pregnancy.\n\n**Types of Moles**\n\n*   **Congenital Nevi**: Sometimes, moles are present at birth or develop during infancy. These moles, which are called congenital nevi, are almost always benign.\n*   **Dysplastic Nevi or Atypical Moles**: Large, irregularly shaped and colored moles can occur at any age. Although not common, they tend to be numerous, and they increase a person's risk of melanoma.\n\n**The Genetics of Melanoma**\n\nAlthough the genetics of melanoma has been widely studied, much less is known about genes involved in the development of benign moles. Variations in several genes, including FGFR3, PIK3CA, HRAS, and BRAF, are involved with benign moles. The most-studied of these is the BRAF gene.\n\n**The Role of Environmental Factors**\n\nIn susceptible individuals (those with fair skin, light hair, skin that burns instead of tans, a family history of melanoma, and genetic risk factors such as deletion of or variants in the CDKN2A gene), ultraviolet radiation from repeated sun exposure can damage existing moles, increasing their risk of becoming malignant.\n\n**Research Directions**\n\nResearchers are working to identify additional susceptibility genes to better understand the genetics of moles and their relationship with cancer.\n\n---\n\n**Moles: A Complex Relationship Between Genetics and Environment**\n\nMoles are a common feature of many people's skin, but their development is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. While it's clear that moles are not solely determined by genetics, the role of heredity in their formation is still not well understood.\n\n**The Genetic Factors Involved in Mole Development**\n\nResearch has identified several genes involved in the development of benign moles, including FGFR3, PIK3CA, HRAS, and BRAF. The most-studied of these is the BRAF gene, which produces an altered protein that causes melanocytes to aggregate into moles. This altered protein also triggers the production of a tumor-suppressor protein called p15, which helps prevent moles from growing too large.\n\n**The Risk of Melanoma**\n\nIn rare cases, variations in the BRAF gene combined with loss of the CDKN2A gene can lead to a lack of p15, creating the potential for mole cells to grow uncontrollably and become cancerous. The formation of cancer is increasingly likely when combined with environmental factors, such as cell damage caused by ultraviolet radiation exposure.\n\n**The Importance of Environmental Factors**\n\nWhile genetics play a role in mole development, it's clear that environmental factors also contribute to their formation. Spending a lot of time in the sun can increase the number of moles a person has, and research has shown that individuals who have an abundance of moles are at an increased risk of melanoma.\n\n**The Complexity of Mole Development**\n\nMoles are not simply a matter of genetics or environment; rather, they represent a complex interplay between these two factors. By understanding the genetic and environmental factors involved in mole development, we can better appreciate the risks and consequences associated with moles.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\nFor those interested in learning more about the genetics of moles, MedlinePlus offers additional resources and information on this topic.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* Mole development is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.\n* The BRAF gene plays a significant role in mole formation.\n* Environmental factors, such as ultraviolet radiation exposure, can increase the risk of melanoma.\n* Understanding the complex relationship between genetics and environment is crucial for appreciating the risks and consequences associated with moles.\n\n---\n\n**Are Moles Determined by Genetics?**\n\n\\n\\n* Are facial dimples determined by genetics?\n* Is athletic performance determined by genetics?\n* Is longevity determined by genetics?\n* Is temperament determined by genetics?\n\n**Other Chapters in Help Me Understand Genetics**\n\n\\n\\n* Topics in the Genetics and Human Traits chapter\n* Collapse Section\n* Are fingerprints determined by genetics?\n* Is eye color determined by genetics?\n* Is intelligence determined by genetics?\n* Is handedness determined by genetics?\n* Is the probability of having twins determined by genetics?\n* Is hair texture determined by genetics?\n* Is hair color determined by genetics?\n* Is height determined by genetics?\n\n**The Information on This Site**\n\n\\n\\nThe information on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a607061.html",
    "content": "**Arformoterol Oral Inhalation**\n\n*pronounced as (ar'' for moe' ter ol)*\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nArformoterol inhalation is used to control wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; a group of lung diseases, which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema). Arformoterol is in a class of medications called long-acting beta agonists (LABAs). It works by relaxing and opening air passages in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nArformoterol comes as a solution (liquid) to inhale by mouth using a nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled). It is usually inhaled twice a day in the morning and the evening. Inhale arformoterol at around the same times every day, and space your doses about 12 hours apart.\n\n* Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n* Use arformoterol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n* Do not swallow or inject arformoterol inhalation.\n* Do not use arformoterol inhalation to treat sudden attacks of COPD. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting beta agonist medication such as albuterol (Accuneb, Proair, Proventil, Ventolin) to use during attacks.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\n* If your COPD symptoms become worse, if arformoterol inhalation becomes less effective, if you need more doses than usual of the medication you use to treat sudden attacks, or if the medication you use to treat attacks does not relieve your symptoms, your condition may be getting worse. Do not use extra doses of arformoterol. Call your doctor right away.\n* Arformoterol controls the symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but does not cure the condition. Continue to use arformoterol even if you feel well. Do not stop using arformoterol without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop using arformoterol, your symptoms may worsen.\n\n**To use arformoterol inhalation:**\n\n* Open the foil pouch by tearing through the rough edge along the edge of the pouch and remove the vial.\n* Look at the solution in the vial to be sure it is colorless. If it is not colorless, call your doctor or pharmacist and do not use the solution.\n* Twist off the top of the vial and squeeze all of the liquid into the reservoir of your nebulizer.

    "content": "**Arginase Deficiency**\n\n**What is Arginase Deficiency?**\n\nArginase deficiency is an inherited disorder that causes the amino acid arginine (a building block of proteins) and ammonia to accumulate gradually in the blood. Ammonia, which is formed when proteins are broken down in the body, is toxic if levels become too high. The nervous system is especially sensitive to the effects of excess ammonia.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nArginase deficiency usually becomes evident by about the age of 3. It most often appears as stiffness, especially in the legs, caused by abnormal tensing of the muscles (spasticity). Other symptoms may include slower than normal growth, developmental delays and eventual loss of developmental milestones, intellectual disabilities, seizures, tremors, and difficulty with balance and coordination (ataxia).\n\n**Frequency**\n\nArginase deficiency is a very rare disorder; it has been estimated to occur once in every 300,000 to 1,000,000 individuals.\n\n**Causes**\n\nArginase deficiency is caused by variants (also called mutations) in the ARG1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called arginase. The arginase enzyme facilitates the final step of the urea cycle, which produces urea by removing nitrogen from arginine. In people with arginase deficiency, arginase is damaged or missing, and arginine is not broken down properly.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nArginase deficiency belongs to a class of genetic diseases called urea cycle disorders. The urea cycle is a sequence of reactions that occurs in liver cells. This cycle processes excess nitrogen, generated when protein is used by the body, to make a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nArginase deficiency is also known as argininosuccinic aciduria or AS.\n\n**References**\n\n* National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)\n* MedlinePlus Genetics\n\n---\n\n**Arginase Deficiency**\n\nLearn more about the gene associated with Arginase deficiency\n\n**The Gene Associated with Arginase Deficiency**\n\nThe ARG1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called arginase.\n\n**What is Arginase Deficiency?**\n\nArginase deficiency belongs to a class of genetic diseases called urea cycle disorders.

In people with arginase deficiency, arginase is damaged or missing, and arginine is not broken down properly. As a result, urea cannot be produced normally, and excess nitrogen accumulates in the blood in the form of ammonia.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* ARG1 deficiency\n* Arginase deficiency disease\n* Hyperargininemia\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Information: [Genetic Testing Registry: Arginase deficiency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/54)\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: [Argininemia](http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=argininemia)\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: [National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)](http://www.rarediseases.org/)\n* Clinical Trials: [ClinicalTrials.gov](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/)\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: [ARGININEMIA](http://omim.org/entry/215605)\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed: [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/)\n\n**References**\n\nAh Mew N, Simpson KL, Gropman AL, Lanpher BC, Chapman KA, Summar ML.

    "content": "**Arginine Vasopressin Deficiency**\n\n**What is Arginine Vasopressin Deficiency?**\n\nArginine vasopressin deficiency, previously known as neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus, is a disorder of water balance. The body normally balances fluid intake by releasing fluid in urine. However, people with arginine vasopressin deficiency produce an excessive amount of urine (polyuria), which depletes the amount of water in the body. This water loss also leads to excessive thirst (polydipsia).\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPeople with arginine vasopressin deficiency can quickly become dehydrated if they do not drink enough water. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fatigue. Prolonged dehydration can lead to confusion, low blood pressure, seizures, and coma. People with this condition often develop high levels of sodium in the blood (hypernatremia) due to dehydration. Repeated cycles of dehydration can cause long-term health problems, particularly in children.\n\n**Causes**\n\nArginine vasopressin deficiency can be either acquired or familial. The acquired form occurs when the brain is damaged due to head injuries, brain tumors, or other events, and this form can occur at any time during life. The familial form is caused by genetic changes; its signs and symptoms usually become apparent in childhood and worsen over time.\n\n**Importance of Correct Diagnosis**\n\nResearchers have recommended using the condition name arginine vasopressin deficiency because the previous name, neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus, was often confused with a much more common disorder called diabetes mellitus. Arginine vasopressin deficiency and diabetes mellitus are separate disorders with different features, causes, and treatment.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n*   Disorder of water balance\n*   Excessive urine production (polyuria)\n*   Dehydration can cause dizziness, fatigue, confusion, low blood pressure, seizures, and coma\n*   Familial form caused by genetic changes; acquired form occurs due to brain damage\n*   Correct diagnosis is crucial to distinguish from diabetes mellitus\n\n---\n\n**Arginine Vasopressin Deficiency**\n\n**What is Arginine Vasopressin Deficiency?**\n\nArginine vasopressin deficiency, previously known as neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus, is a rare disorder that affects the body's ability to balance fluids. It occurs in approximately 1 in 25,000 individuals.\n\n**Causes of Arginine Vasopressin Deficiency**\n\nThe familial form of arginine vasopressin deficiency is caused by variants (also called mutations) in the AVP gene. This gene provides instructions for making a hormone called arginine vasopressin (AVP), which helps control the body's water balance.\n\n*   Variants in the AVP gene result in the production of an AVP hormone that does not get released from brain cells.\n*   Without this hormone, the kidneys do not reabsorb water as they should, and the body makes excessive amounts of urine.\n\nThe acquired form of arginine vasopressin deficiency occurs when the areas of the brain that produce or store AVP are damaged by:\n\n*   Head injuries\n*   Brain tumors\n*   Brain surgery\n*   Certain diseases and infections\n*   Bleeding in the brain\n\nIn 30 to 50 percent of all cases of arginine vasopressin deficiency, the cause of the disorder is unknown. Studies suggest that some of these cases may be caused by a malfunctioning immune system that attacks the body's own tissues and organs.\n\n**Symptoms of Arginine Vasopressin Deficiency**\n\nPeople with arginine vasopressin deficiency produce an excessive amount of urine (polyuria), which depletes the amount of water in the body. This water loss also leads to excessive thirst (polydipsia). If left untreated, dehydration can cause dizziness and fatigue, confusion, low blood pressure, seizures, and coma.\n\n**Treatment of Arginine Vasopressin Deficiency**\n\nThe treatment for arginine vasopressin deficiency depends on the underlying cause of the disorder. In some cases, hormone replacement therapy may be necessary to replace the deficient hormone. In other cases, treatment may focus on managing the symptoms of dehydration and addressing any underlying medical conditions that may have contributed to the development of the disorder.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nArginine vasopressin deficiency is a rare disorder that affects the body's ability to balance fluids. It occurs in approximately 1 in 25,000 individuals and can be caused by genetic mutations or damage to the brain. If left untreated, dehydration can cause serious health complications. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for managing the symptoms of arginine vasopressin deficiency and preventing long-term health problems.\n\n---\n\n**Arginine Vasopressin Deficiency**\n\n**What is Arginine Vasopressin Deficiency?**\n\nArginine vasopressin deficiency, also known as central diabetes insipidus, is a rare disorder characterized by the inability of the body to produce sufficient antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as arginine vasopressin. This leads to an imbalance in water balance, resulting in excessive urine production and other features of the disorder.\n\n**Causes of Arginine Vasopressin Deficiency**\n\nIn 30 to 50 percent of all cases of arginine vasopressin deficiency, the cause of the disorder is unknown. Studies suggest that some of these cases may be caused by a malfunctioning immune system that attacks the body's own tissues and organs.\n\n**Genetic Inheritance**\n\nFamilial arginine vasopressin deficiency is almost always inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that one copy of the altered AVP gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In a few affected families, familial arginine vasopressin deficiency has had an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nCentral diabetes insipidus\nDiabetes insipidus secondary to vasopressin deficiency\nDiabetes insipidus, central\nDiabetes insipidus, neurogenic\nDiabetes insipidus, neurohypophyseal\nDiabetes insipidus, pituitary\nNeurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus\nPituitary diabetes insipidus\nVasopressin defective diabetes insipidus\nVasopressin deficiency\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Information:\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Central diabetes insipidus\n*   Patient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n    *   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   Clinical Trials:\n    *   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n    *   DIABETES INSIPIDUS, NEUROHYPOPHYSEAL\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n    *   PubMed\n\n**References**\n\nAtila C, Loughrey PB, Garrahy A, Winzeler B, Refardt J, Gildroy P, Hamza M,\nPal A, Verbalis JG, Thompson CJ, Hemkens LG, Hunter SJ, Sherlock M, Levy MJ,\nKaravitaki N, Newell-Price J, Wass JAH, Christ-Crain M.

This hormone plays a crucial role in regulating fluid balance and electrolyte levels in the body.\n\n**Causes of AVP Deficiency**\n\nThe causes of AVP deficiency can be genetic or acquired. Genetic forms are usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, while acquired forms can result from head trauma, infections, or other injuries that damage the hypothalamus or pituitary gland.\n\n**Symptoms of AVP Deficiency**\n\nThe symptoms of AVP deficiency include:\n\n*   Polyuria (excessive urine production)\n*   Polydipsia (excessive thirst)\n*   Hypernatremia (elevated sodium levels in the blood)\n*   Dehydration\n*   Electrolyte imbalances\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment of AVP Deficiency**\n\nThe diagnosis of AVP deficiency typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Treatment usually involves replacement therapy with synthetic AVP or desmopressin, a medication that mimics the effects of AVP.\n\n**Prognosis of AVP Deficiency**\n\nWith proper treatment and management, individuals with AVP deficiency can lead normal lives. However, they may require ongoing medical care to monitor their condition and adjust their treatment as needed.\n\n**Genetic Aspects of AVP Deficiency**\n\nAVP deficiency is a genetic disorder that can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means that a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the condition. The genetic basis of AVP deficiency has been extensively studied, and several genes have been identified as contributing to the development of the disorder.\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\nGenetics play a crucial role in understanding the causes and consequences of AVP deficiency. By studying the genetic aspects of the disorder, researchers can gain insights into the underlying mechanisms that lead to the condition and develop more effective treatments.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\nAVP deficiency is related to other health topics, including diabetes insipidus, genetic disorders, antidiuretic hormone blood tests, central diabetes insipidus, and genetics.",

    "content": "**Arginine Vasopressin Resistance**\n\n**What is Arginine Vasopressin Resistance?**\n\nArginine vasopressin resistance (previously called nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) is a disorder of water balance. The body normally balances fluid intake by releasing excess fluid in urine. However, people with arginine vasopressin resistance produce an excessive amount of urine (polyuria), which depletes the amount of water in the body. This water loss also leads to excessive thirst (polydipsia).\n\n**Symptoms and Effects**\n\nAffected individuals can quickly become dehydrated if they do not drink enough water. Dehydration can cause dizziness and fatigue. Prolonged dehydration can lead to confusion, low blood pressure, seizures, and coma. People with arginine vasopressin resistance often develop high levels of sodium in the blood (hypernatremia) due to dehydration.\n\n**Forms of Arginine Vasopressin Resistance**\n\nArginine vasopressin resistance can be either acquired or familial. The acquired form can occur at any time during life. The familial form usually become apparent within the first year of life, though in some cases they develop in adolescence or early adulthood.\n\n**Effects on Infants with Familial Form**\n\nInfants with familial arginine vasopressin resistance tend to have problems feeding and gaining weight (failure to thrive). They may also be irritable and experience fevers, diarrhea, and vomiting. Recurrent episodes of dehydration can lead to slow growth and delayed development. If the condition is not well-managed, it can damage the bladder and kidneys leading to pain, infections, and kidney failure.\n\n**Treatment and Outcome**\n\nWith appropriate treatment, affected individuals usually have few complications and a normal lifespan. Researchers have recommended using the condition name arginine vasopressin resistance because the previous name, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, was often confused with a much more common disorder called diabetes mellitus. Arginine vasopressin resistance and diabetes mellitus are separate disorders with different features, causes, and treatment.\n\n**References**\n\n(No references provided in the original text)\n\n---\n\n**Arginine Vasopressin Resistance**\n\n**What is Arginine Vasopressin Resistance?**\n\nArginine vasopressin resistance, previously known as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, is a disorder of water balance where the body produces an excessive amount of urine (polyuria), leading to dehydration and other complications.\n\n**Causes of Arginine Vasopressin Resistance**\n\nThe familial form of arginine vasopressin resistance can be caused by variants in at least two genes that are active in the kidneys: AVPR2 and AQP2. About 90% of cases are caused by variants in the AVPR2 gene, while the remaining 10% are caused by variants in the AQP2 gene.\n\n**Symptoms of Arginine Vasopressin Resistance**\n\nAffected individuals can quickly become dehydrated if they do not drink enough water, leading to dizziness and fatigue. Prolonged dehydration can cause confusion, low blood pressure, seizures, and coma. People with arginine vasopressin resistance often develop high levels of sodium in the blood (hypernatremia) due to dehydration.\n\n**Types of Arginine Vasopressin Resistance**\n\nThere are two types of arginine vasopressin resistance: familial and acquired. The familial form usually becomes apparent within the first year of life, while the acquired form can occur at any time during life due to head injuries, brain tumors, or other events.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nWith appropriate treatment, affected individuals usually have few complications and a normal lifespan. However, if the condition is not well-managed, it can damage the bladder and kidneys leading to pain, infections, and kidney failure.\n\n**Frequency of Arginine Vasopressin Resistance**\n\nThe prevalence of arginine vasopressin resistance is unknown, although the condition is thought to be rare. The acquired form occurs more frequently than the familial form.\n\n**Learn More About the Genes Associated with Arginine Vasopressin Resistance**\n\n*   AQP2\n*   AVPR2\n\n---\n\n**Arginine Vasopressin Resistance**\n\n**What is Arginine Vasopressin Resistance?**\n\nArginine vasopressin resistance, also known as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, is a condition where the kidneys are unable to respond to arginine vasopressin (AVP), a hormone that helps regulate water balance in the body.\n\n**Causes of Arginine Vasopressin Resistance**\n\nThere are two forms of arginine vasopressin resistance: familial and acquired. The familial form is caused by variants in at least two genes, AVPR2 and AQP2, which are active in the kidneys. About 90 percent of all cases of familial arginine vasopressin resistance are caused by variants in the AVPR2 gene.\n\nThe acquired form of arginine vasopressin resistance occurs when the brain is damaged due to head injuries, brain tumors, or other events. It can also be caused by chronic kidney disease, certain medications (such as lithium), low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia), high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia), or an obstructed urinary tract.\n\n**Genetic Basis of Arginine Vasopressin Resistance**\n\nThe AVPR2 gene provides instructions for making the vasopressin V2 receptor protein, and the AQP2 gene provides instructions for making aquaporin-2 protein. Both proteins work with arginine vasopressin (AVP) to help determine how much water is released in urine.\n\nVariants in the AVPR2 or AQP2 genes lead to the production of proteins that are unable to respond to AVP. The brain produces and releases AVP normally, but the kidneys function as if little or no hormone is present.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nWhen arginine vasopressin resistance is caused by variants in the AVPR2 gene, the condition has an X-linked pattern of inheritance. This means that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.\n\nWhen arginine vasopressin resistance is caused by variants in the AQP2 gene, it can have either an autosomal recessive or, less commonly, an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nADH-resistant diabetes insipidus\nCongenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus\nDiabetes insipidus renalis\nDiabetes insipidus, nephrogenic\nNDI\nNephrogenic diabetes insipidus\nVasopressin-resistant diabetes insipidus\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Registry: Diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic, autosomal\nGenetic Testing Registry: Diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic, X-linked\nGenetic Testing Registry: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus\nGenetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus\nPatient Support and Advocacy Resources:\nNational Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n---\n\n**Arginine Vasopressin Resistance: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 4/4)**\n\n**Information Center**\n\n*   **Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus**\n*   **Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n    *   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   **Clinical Trials**\n    *   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n    *   DIABETES INSIPIDUS, NEPHROGENIC, 2, AUTOSOMAL; NDI2\n    *   DIABETES INSIPIDUS, NEPHROGENIC, 1, X-LINKED; NDI1\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   Atila C, Loughrey PB, Garrahy A, Winzeler B, Refardt J, Gildroy P, Hamza M,\n    Pal A, Verbalis JG, Thompson CJ, Hemkens LG, Hunter SJ, Sherlock M, Levy MJ,\n    Karavitaki N, Newell-Price J, Wass JAH, Christ-Crain M.

    "content": "**Arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency**\n\n**Description**\n\nArginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency is an inherited disorder that primarily affects the brain. People with this disorder have mild to moderate intellectual disability and delayed speech development. Some affected individuals develop autistic behaviors that affect communication and social interaction. They may experience seizures, especially when they have a fever.\n\nChildren with arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency may not gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive), and have delayed development of motor skills such as sitting and walking. Affected individuals may also have weak muscle tone and tend to tire easily.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThe prevalence of arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency is unknown. The disorder has been identified in only a few families.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the GATM gene cause arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency. The GATM gene provides instructions for making the enzyme arginine:glycine amidinotransferase. This enzyme participates in the two-step production (synthesis) of the compound creatine from the protein building blocks (amino acids) glycine, arginine, and methionine. Specifically, arginine:glycine amidinotransferase controls the first step of the process. In this step, a compound called guanidinoacetic acid is produced by transferring a cluster of nitrogen and hydrogen atoms called a guanidino group from arginine to glycine. Guanidinoacetic acid is converted to creatine in the second step of the process. Creatine is needed for the body to store and use energy properly.\n\nGATM gene mutations impair the ability of the arginine:glycine amidinotransferase enzyme to participate in creatine synthesis, resulting in a shortage of creatine. The effects of arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency are most severe in organs and tissues that require large amounts of energy, especially the brain.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n* Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* AGAT deficiency\n* GATM deficiency\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* National Institutes of Health (NIH) - Genetic Disorders\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - Genetic Disorders\n\n---\n\n**Arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency**\n\nThe effects of arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency are most severe in organs and tissues that require large amounts of energy, especially the brain.\n\n**Learn more about the gene associated with Arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency**\n\n*   **GATM**\n    Learn more about the gene associated with Arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.

    "content": "**Argininosuccinic Aciduria**\n\n**What is Argininosuccinic Aciduria?**\n\nArgininosuccinic aciduria is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia to accumulate in the blood. Ammonia, which is formed when proteins are broken down in the body, is toxic if the levels become too high. The nervous system is especially sensitive to the effects of excess ammonia.\n\n**Symptoms of Argininosuccinic Aciduria**\n\nArgininosuccinic aciduria usually becomes evident in the first few days of life. An infant with argininosuccinic aciduria may be lacking in energy (lethargic) or unwilling to eat, and have a poorly controlled breathing rate or body temperature. Some babies with this disorder experience seizures or unusual body movements, or go into a coma. Complications from argininosuccinic aciduria may include developmental delay and intellectual disability. Progressive liver damage, high blood pressure (hypertension), skin lesions, and brittle hair may also be seen.\n\n**Mild Form of Argininosuccinic Aciduria**\n\nOccasionally, individuals may inherit a mild form of the disorder. These individuals can have an accumulation of ammonia in the bloodstream only during periods of illness or other stress, or mild intellectual disability or learning disabilities with no evidence of elevated ammonia levels.\n\n**Frequency of Argininosuccinic Aciduria**\n\nArgininosuccinic aciduria occurs in approximately 1 in 70,000 to 218,000 newborns. Most cases of this condition are detected shortly after birth by newborn screening.\n\n**Causes of Argininosuccinic Aciduria**\n\nMutations in the ASL gene cause argininosuccinic aciduria. This condition belongs to a class of genetic diseases called urea cycle disorders because they are caused by problems with a process in the body called the urea cycle. The urea cycle is a sequence of reactions that occurs in liver cells. This cycle breaks down excess nitrogen, which is made when protein is used by the body, to make a compound called urea. Urea is removed from the body in urine. Breaking down excess nitrogen and excreting it as urea prevents it from accumulating in the body as ammonia.\n\n**Inheritance of Argininosuccinic Aciduria**\n\nThe ASL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called argininosuccinate lyase, which is needed for the fourth step of the urea cycle. The specific role of the argininosuccinate lyase enzyme is to start the reaction in which the amino acid arginine, a building block of proteins, is produced from argininosuccinate, the molecule that carries the waste nitrogen collected earlier in the urea cycle. In people with argininosuccinic aciduria, argininosuccinate lyase is dysfunctional or missing.\n\n---\n\n**Argininosuccinic Aciduria**\n\nAs a result, the urea cycle cannot proceed normally, arginine is not produced, and nitrogen is not broken down efficiently. The excess nitrogen accumulates in the blood in the form of ammonia. This buildup of ammonia damages the brain and other tissues and causes neurological problems and other signs and symptoms of argininosuccinic aciduria.\n\n**The Urea Cycle**\n\nThe urea cycle is a sequence of reactions that occurs in liver cells. This cycle breaks down excess nitrogen, which is made when protein is used by the body, to make a compound called urea. Urea is removed from the body in urine.

    "content": "**Argininosuccinic Aciduria**\n\n**What is Argininosuccinic Aciduria?**\n\nArgininosuccinic aciduria is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia to accumulate in the blood. Ammonia, which is formed when proteins are broken down in the body, is toxic if the levels become too high. The nervous system is especially sensitive to the effects of excess ammonia.\n\n**Symptoms of Argininosuccinic Aciduria**\n\nArgininosuccinic aciduria usually becomes evident in the first few days of life. An infant with argininosuccinic aciduria may be lacking in energy (lethargic) or unwilling to eat, and have a poorly controlled breathing rate or body temperature. Some babies with this disorder experience seizures or unusual body movements, or go into a coma. Complications from argininosuccinic aciduria may include developmental delay and intellectual disability. Progressive liver damage, high blood pressure (hypertension), skin lesions, and brittle hair may also be seen.\n\n**Mild Form of Argininosuccinic Aciduria**\n\nOccasionally, individuals may inherit a mild form of the disorder. These individuals can have an accumulation of ammonia in the bloodstream only during periods of illness or other stress, or mild intellectual disability or learning disabilities with no evidence of elevated ammonia levels.\n\n**Frequency of Argininosuccinic Aciduria**\n\nArgininosuccinic aciduria occurs in approximately 1 in 70,000 to 218,000 newborns. Most cases of this condition are detected shortly after birth by newborn screening.\n\n**Causes of Argininosuccinic Aciduria**\n\nMutations in the ASL gene cause argininosuccinic aciduria. This condition belongs to a class of genetic diseases called urea cycle disorders because they are caused by problems with a process in the body called the urea cycle. The urea cycle is a sequence of reactions that occurs in liver cells. This cycle breaks down excess nitrogen, which is made when protein is used by the body, to make a compound called urea. Urea is removed from the body in urine. Breaking down excess nitrogen and excreting it as urea prevents it from accumulating in the body as ammonia.\n\n**Inheritance of Argininosuccinic Aciduria**\n\nThe ASL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called argininosuccinate lyase, which is needed for the fourth step of the urea cycle. The specific role of the argininosuccinate lyase enzyme is to start the reaction in which the amino acid arginine, a building block of proteins, is produced from argininosuccinate, the molecule that carries the waste nitrogen collected earlier in the urea cycle. In people with argininosuccinic aciduria, argininosuccinate lyase is dysfunctional or missing.\n\n---\n\n**Argininosuccinic Aciduria**\n\nAs a result, the urea cycle cannot proceed normally, arginine is not produced, and nitrogen is not broken down efficiently. The excess nitrogen accumulates in the blood in the form of ammonia. This buildup of ammonia damages the brain and other tissues and causes neurological problems and other signs and symptoms of argininosuccinic aciduria.\n\n**The Urea Cycle**\n\nThe urea cycle is a sequence of reactions that occurs in liver cells. This cycle breaks down excess nitrogen, which is made when protein is used by the body, to make a compound called urea. Urea is removed from the body in urine.

    "content": "**Aripiprazole**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nAripiprazole is used to treat:\n\n* schizophrenia (a mental illness that affects how a person thinks, feels and behaves)\n* bipolar disorder (a disease that causes depression, mania, and other abnormal moods)\n* major depressive disorder\n* irritability symptoms (aggression, temper tantrums, mood changes) in those with autistic disorder (a developmental problem that affects how individuals communicate, learn and behave)\n* Tourette's disorder (a condition causing involuntary, repetitive movements or sounds)\n\nAripiprazole is in a class of medications called atypical antipsychotics. It works by changing the activity of certain natural substances in the brain.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAripiprazole comes as a tablet and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth, an orally disintegrating tablet—a tablet that dissolves quickly in the mouth), and a film to place on the tongue. Take once a day with or without food. Take aripiprazole at around the same time every day.\n\nTake aripiprazole exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n---\n\n**Aripiprazole: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**How Should This Medicine Be Used?**\n\nAripiprazole comes as a tablet and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth, an orally disintegrating tablet—a tablet that dissolves quickly in the mouth), and a film to place on the tongue. Take once a day with or without food. Take aripiprazole at around the same time every day.\n\nTake aripiprazole exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n*   Use an oral syringe or dosing cup (measuring device) to accurately measure and take your dose of aripiprazole solution. Do not use a household spoon or cup.\n*   Swallow the tablets whole; do not divide, crush, or chew.\n*   Use dry hands to peel back the foil packaging of the orally disintegrating tablet. Do not try to push it through the foil. Immediately take out the tablet. Place the entire tablet on your tongue. Do not try to split the tablet.\n*   Place the film on the top of the tongue. It should dissolve in saliva and can be swallowed. Do not chew the film.\n\nYour doctor may start you on a low dose of aripiprazole and gradually increase or decrease your dose depending on how well the medication works for you and the side effects you experience.\n\nAripiprazole may help control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. It may take 2 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of aripiprazole. Continue to take aripiprazole even if you feel well. Do not stop taking aripiprazole without talking to your doctor.\n\n**What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n\nBefore taking aripiprazole, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to this drug, any part of this drug, or any other drugs, foods or substances. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about the allergy and what symptoms you had.\n\nTell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking aripiprazole. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nThe following nonprescription drugs or herbal products may interact with aripiprazole: allergy medications (diphenhydramine, loratadine, fexofenadine, chlorpheniramine or cetirizine), and St. John's wort. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these products before you start taking aripiprazole.\n\nDo not start any of these medications while taking aripiprazole without discussing with your healthcare provider.\n\nTell your doctor if you have severe diarrhea or vomiting or you think you may be dehydrated. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had heart disease, heart failure, a heart attack, an irregular heartbeat, high or low blood pressure, a stroke, a ministroke, seizures, a low number of white blood cells, dyslipidemia (high cholesterol levels), trouble keeping your balance, or any condition that makes it difficult for you to swallow.\n\nTell your doctor if you or anyone in your family use or have ever used street drugs or have overused prescription medication or alcohol or has or has ever had diabetes, obsessive compulsive disorder, impulse-control disorder, bipolar disorder, or an impulsive personality. Also tell your doctor if you have ever had to stop taking a medication for mental illness because of severe side effects.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking aripiprazole, call your doctor. Aripiprazole may cause problems in newborns following delivery if it is taken during the last months of pregnancy.\n\nIf you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking aripiprazole.\n\nYou should know that aripiprazole may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.\n\nYou should know that alcohol can add to the drowsiness caused by this medication.

If you have schizophrenia, you're more likely to develop diabetes than people who don't have schizophrenia. Taking aripiprazole or similar medications may increase this risk.\n    *   Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms:\n        1.  Extreme thirst\n        2.  Frequent urination\n        3.  Extreme hunger\n        4.  Blurred vision\n        5.  Weakness\n\n**Dizziness and Fainting**\n\nAripiprazole may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting when you get up too quickly from a lying position. This is more common when you first start taking aripiprazole.\n\n*   To avoid this problem, get out of bed slowly, resting your feet on the floor for a few minutes before standing up.\n\n**Heat Exposure**\n\nAripiprazole may make it harder for your body to cool down when it gets very hot. Tell your doctor if you plan to do vigorous exercise or be exposed to extreme heat.\n\n**Phenylketonuria (PKU)**\n\nIf you have PKU, an inherited condition in which a special diet must be followed to prevent damage to your brain that can cause severe intellectual disability, you should know that the orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine.\n\n**Diabetes**\n\nIf you have diabetes, you should know that aripiprazole solution contains sugar.\n\n**Gambling Problems and Intense Urges**\n\nSome people who have taken medications such as aripiprazole have developed gambling problems or other intense urges or behaviors that were compulsive or unusual for them. Call your doctor if you experience any of the following:\n\n*   Intense urges to shop, eat, have sex, or gamble\n*   Unable to control your behavior\n\nTell your family members about this risk so that they can call the doctor even if you don't realize that these behaviors have become a problem.\n\n**Children's Treatment**\n\nWhen aripiprazole is used to treat children, it should be used as part of a treatment program that may include counseling and special education. Be sure that your child follows all of his or her doctor's or therapist's instructions.\n\n**Special Dietary Instructions**\n\nTalk to your doctor about drinking grapefruit juice and eating grapefruit while taking this medicine.\n\n---\n\n**Aripiprazole: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 4/5)**\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nTalk to your doctor about drinking grapefruit juice and eating grapefruit while taking this medicine.\n\nBe sure to drink plenty of water every day while you are taking this medication.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nAripiprazole may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* headache\n* nervousness\n* restlessness\n* dizziness, feeling unsteady, or having trouble keeping your balance\n* heartburn\n* constipation\n* diarrhea\n* stomach pain\n* weight gain\n* changes in appetite\n* increased salivation\n* pain, especially in the arms, legs, or joints\n* tiredness\n\nSome side effects can be serious.

    "content": "**Arm CT Scan**\n\nComputed tomography (CT) scan of the arm is an imaging method that uses x-rays to make cross-sectional pictures of the arm.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nYou will lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner. The machine's x-ray beam rotates around you, creating separate images of the arm area called slices. These images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, or printed on film. Three-dimensional models of the arm can be created by adding the slices together.\n\nYou must remain still during the exam to avoid blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time. The scan should take only 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nFor some tests, you will need to have a special dye, called contrast, delivered into the body before the test starts. Contrast can be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. If contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.\n\nLet your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test to safely receive contrast. Before receiving the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes drug metformin (Glucophage). You may need to take special steps if you are on this medicine.\n\nIf you weigh more than 300 pounds (135 kilograms), find out if the CT machine has a weight limit. Too much weight can cause damage to the scanner's working parts. Remove jewelry and wear a hospital gown during the study as metal can affect the CT images.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nSome people may have discomfort from lying on the hard table. Contrast given through an IV may cause a slight burning sensation, a metallic taste in the mouth, and a warm flushing of the body. These feelings are normal and will go away within a few seconds.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nCT rapidly creates detailed pictures of the body, including the arms. The test may help detect or diagnose:\n\n* An abscess or infection\n* The cause of pain or other problems in the wrist, shoulder, or elbow joints (usually when MRI cannot be done)\n* A broken bone\n* Masses and tumors, including cancer\n* Healing problems or scar tissue following surgery\n* A deformity so the provider can plan appropriate treatment\n\nA CT scan may also be used to guide a surgeon to the right area during a biopsy.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nResults are considered normal if no problems are seen in the images.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal results may be due to:\n\n* Degenerative changes due to age\n* Abscess (collection of pus)\n* Blood clot in the arm (deep venous thrombosis)\n* Bone tumors\n* Cancer\n* Broken or fractured bone\n* Damage to the hand, wrist, or elbow joints\n* Cyst\n* Healing problems or development of scar tissue after surgery\n* Deformity from growth\n\n---\n\n**Arm CT Scan**\n\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the arm is an imaging method that uses x-rays to make cross-sectional pictures of the arm.\n\n**What the Test is For**\n\nThe test helps guide a surgeon to the right area during a biopsy.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nResults are considered normal if no problems are seen in the images.\n\n**Abnormal Results**\n\nAbnormal results may be due to:\n\n* Degenerative changes due to age\n* Abscess (collection of pus)\n* Blood clot in the arm (deep venous thrombosis)\n* Bone tumors\n* Cancer\n* Broken or fractured bone\n* Damage to the hand, wrist, or elbow joints\n* Cyst\n* Healing problems or development of scar tissue after surgery\n* Deformity from growth\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of CT scans include:\n\n* Being exposed to radiation\n* Allergic reaction to contrast dye\n* Birth defect if done during pregnancy\n\nCT scans expose you to more radiation than regular x-rays. Having many x-rays or CT scans over time may increase your risk for cancer. However, the risk from any one scan is small. You and your provider should weigh this risk against the benefits of getting a correct diagnosis for a medical problem.\n\nSome people have allergies to contrast dye.

    "content": "**Arm MRI Scan**\n\nAn arm MRI scan uses strong magnets to create pictures of the upper and lower arm. This includes the elbow, wrist, hands, fingers, and surrounding muscles and other tissues.\n\nIt does not use radiation (x-rays).\n\n*Single MRI images are called slices.* The images can be stored on a computer or printed on film. One exam produces many images.*\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nYou will wear a hospital gown or clothes without metal zippers or snaps (such as sweatpants and a t-shirt). Make sure you take off your watch, jewelry, and wallet. MRI can pull on any metallic objects. Some types of metal can cause blurry images.\n\nYou will lie on a narrow table that slides into a large tunnel-like scanner.\n\nSome exams use a special dye (contrast). Most of the time, you will get the dye through a vein in your arm or hand before the test. The dye helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly.\n\nDuring the MRI, the person who operates the machine will watch you from another room. The test most often lasts 30 to 60 minutes, but may take longer.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan.\n\nTell your health care provider if you are afraid of closed spaces (have claustrophobia). You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious. Your provider may suggest an \"open\" MRI, in which the machine is not as close to the body.\n\nBefore the test, tell your provider if you have:\n\n* Brain aneurysm clips\n* Certain types of artificial heart valves\n* Heart defibrillator or pacemaker\n* Inner ear (cochlear) implants\n* Kidney disease or dialysis (you may not be able to receive contrast)\n* Recently placed artificial joints or surgery with metal plates and screws\n* Certain types of vascular stents\n* Worked with sheet metal in the past (you may need tests to check for metal pieces in your eyes)\n\nBecause the MRI contains strong magnets, metal objects are not allowed into the room with the MRI scanner:\n\n* Pens, pocketknives, and eyeglasses may fly across the room.\n* Items such as jewelry, watches, credit cards, and hearing aids can be damaged.\n* Pins, hairpins, metal zippers, and similar metallic items can distort the images.\n* Removable dental work should be taken out just before the scan.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nAn MRI exam causes no pain. You will need to lie still. Too much movement can blur MRI images and cause errors.\n\nThe table may be hard or cold, but you can ask for a blanket or pillow. The machine makes loud thumping and humming noises when turned on. You can wear ear plugs to help block out the noise.\n\nAn intercom in the room allows you to speak to someone at any time. Some MRIs have televisions and special headphones to help the time pass.\n\nThere is no recovery time, unless you were given a medicine to relax. After an MRI scan, you can return to your normal diet, activity, and medicines.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test provides clear pictures of parts of the arm that are hard to see clearly on CT scans.\n\nYour provider may order this test if you have:\n\n* A mass that can be felt on a physical exam\n* An abnormal finding on an x-ray or bone scan\n* Arm pain and a history of cancer\n* Arm or wrist pain that does not get better with treatment\n* Bone infection (osteomyelitis)\n* Bone pain and fever\n* Broken bone\n* Decreased motion or \"locking up\" of the wrist or elbow joint\n* Redness or swelling of the wrist or elbow joints\n* Injuries to the cartilage and ligaments\n* Deformity to allow your physician assess the condition better\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA normal result means your arm looks OK.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal results may be due to:\n\n* Degenerative changes due to age\n* Abscess\n* Bursitis of the elbow or wrist\n* Broken bone or fracture\n* Ganglion cyst in the wrist\n* Infection in the bone\n* Ligament, tendon, or cartilage injury in the wrist or elbow\n* Muscle damage\n* Osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis)\n* Tumor or cancer in the bone, muscle, or soft tissue\n\nTalk to your provider if you have questions and concerns.\n\n**Risks**\n\nMRI uses no radiation. There have been no reported side effects from the magnetic fields and radio waves.\n\nIt is also safe to have MRI performed during pregnancy. No side effects or complications have been proven.\n\nThe most common type of contrast (dye) used is gadolinium. It is very safe. Allergic reactions to the substance are rare. However, gadolinium can be harmful to people with kidney problems that need dialysis. If you have kidney problems, please tell your provider before the test.\n\nThe strong magnetic fields created during an MRI can cause heart pacemakers and other implants to not work as well. It can also cause a piece of metal inside your body to move or shift. For safety reasons, please do not bring anything that contains metal into the scanner room.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nTests that may be done instead of an MRI of the arm include:\n\n* CT scan of the arm\n* Arm x-ray\n\nA CT scan may be preferred in an emergency.

    "content": "**Armodafinil**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nArmodafinil is used to treat excessive sleepiness caused by narcolepsy (a condition that causes excessive daytime sleepiness) or shift work sleep disorder (sleepiness during scheduled waking hours and difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep during scheduled sleeping hours in people who work at night or on rotating shifts). Armodafinil is also used along with breathing devices or other treatments to prevent excessive sleepiness caused by obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS; a sleep disorder in which the patient briefly stops breathing or breathes shallowly many times during sleep and therefore does not get enough restful sleep).\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nArmodafinil comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day. If you are taking armodafinil to treat narcolepsy or OSAHS, you will probably take it in the morning. If you are taking armodafinil to treat shift work sleep disorder, you will probably take it 1 hour before the start of your shift. Take armodafinil at around the same time every day. Do not change the time of day that you take armodafinil without talking to your doctor.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nArmodafinil may be habit forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor. Armodafinil may decrease your sleepiness, but it will not cure your sleep disorder. Continue to take armodafinil even if you feel well-rested. Do not stop taking armodafinil without talking to your doctor.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake armodafinil exactly as directed. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nThe most common side effects of armodafinil include headache, back pain, dry mouth, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, and nausea. Less common side effects may include increased heart rate, high blood pressure, and changes in appetite or weight.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore armodafinil at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Do not take medicine that is expired or spoiled. If you have any leftover armodafinil tablets, ask your pharmacist how to dispose of them safely.\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you think you have taken too much armodafinil, call your doctor or local poison control center right away. Symptoms of overdose may include agitation, confusion, hallucinations, and seizures.\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nArmodafinil is a prescription medication that should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Do not share armodafinil with others, even if they have similar symptoms or conditions. Keep armodafinil out of reach of children and pets.\n\n---\n\n**Armodafinil: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking armodafinil, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to armodafinil, modafinil (Provigil) or any other medications. Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking armodafinil.\n\nThe following nonprescription products may interact with armodafinil: omeprazole. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking armodafinil. Do not start any of these medications while taking armodafinil without discussing with your healthcare provider.\n\nTell your doctor if you drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, use or have ever used street drugs or have overused prescription medications. Also tell your doctor if you have ever had chest pain, an irregular heartbeat, or other heart problems after taking a stimulant, and if you have or have ever had a heart attack; chest pain; high blood pressure; a mental illness such as depression, mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood), or psychosis (difficulty thinking clearly, communicating, understanding reality, and behaving appropriately); or heart, liver, or kidney disease.\n\nYou should know that armodafinil may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, implants, injections, and intrauterine devices). Use another form of birth control while you are taking armodafinil and for 1 month after you stop taking it. Talk to your doctor about types of birth control that will work for you during and after your treatment with armodafinil.\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking armodafinil, call your doctor.\n\nIf you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking armodafinil.\n\nYou should know that armodafinil may affect your judgment, thinking and movement, and may not completely relieve the sleepiness caused by your disorder. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you. If you avoided driving and other dangerous activities because of your sleep disorder, do not start performing these activities again without talking to your doctor even if you feel more alert.\n\nBe aware that you should avoid drinking alcohol while you are taking this medication.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nTalk to your doctor about eating grapefruit and drinking grapefruit juice while taking this medicine.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nSkip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nArmodafinil may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* headache\n* dizziness\n* difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep\n* difficulty concentrating or paying attention\n* uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body\n* numbness, burning, or tingling of the hands or feet\n* nausea\n* vomiting\n* heartburn\n* stomach pain\n* constipation\n* diarrhea\n* loss of appetite\n* thirst\n* dry mouth\n* sweating\n* frequent urination\n\nSome side effects can be serious.

Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom).\n\nStore armodafinil in a safe place so that no one else can take it accidentally or on purpose. Keep track of how many tablets are left so you will know if any are missing.\n\nDispose of unneeded medications in a way so that pets, children, and other people cannot take them. Do not flush this medication down the toilet. Use a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist about take-back programs in your community. Visit the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website for more information.\n\nKeep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers are not child-resistant. Always lock safety caps. Place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.\n\n**In Case of Emergency/Overdose**\n\nIn case of overdose, call the poison control helpline at 1-800-222-1222.

    "content": "**Armpit Lump**\n\nAn armpit lump is a swelling or bump under the arm. A lump in the armpit can have many causes, including swollen lymph nodes, infections, or cysts.\n\n**Causes**\n\nLymph nodes act as filters that can catch germs or cancerous tumor cells. When they do, lymph nodes increase in size and are easily felt. Reasons lymph nodes in the armpit area may be enlarged are:\n\n* Arm or breast infection\n* Some body-wide infections, such as mono, AIDS, or herpes\n* Cancers, such as lymphomas or breast cancer\n\nCysts or abscesses under the skin may also produce large, painful lumps in the armpit. These may be caused by shaving or use of antiperspirants (not deodorants). This is most often seen in teens just beginning to shave.\n\nOther causes of armpit lumps may include:\n\n* Cat scratch disease\n* Lipomas (harmless fatty growths)\n* Use of certain medicines or vaccinations\n\n**Home Care**\n\nHome care depends on the reason for the lump. Check with your health care provider to determine the cause.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nAn armpit lump in a woman may be a sign of breast cancer, and it should be checked by a provider right away.\n\nContact your provider if you have an unexplained armpit lump. Do not try to diagnose lumps by yourself.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will examine you and gently press on the nodes. You will be asked questions about your medical history and symptoms, such as:\n\n* When did you first notice the lump? Has the lump changed?\n* Are you breastfeeding?\n* Is there anything that makes the lump worse?\n* Is the lump painful?\n* Do you have any other symptoms?\n\nYou may need more tests, depending on the results of your physical exam.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nLump in the armpit; Localized lymphadenopathy - armpit; Axillary lymphadenopathy; Axillary lymph enlargement; Lymph nodes enlargement - axillary; Axillary abscess\n\n**References**\n\nMiyake KK, Ikeda DM.

In this article, we'll explore the possible causes of an armpit lump and what you can do about it.\n\n**Causes of Armpit Lumps**\n\nThere are several possible causes of an armpit lump, including:\n\n*   **Shaving or use of antiperspirants**: These can cause lumps in the armpit, especially in teens who are just starting to shave.\n*   **Cat scratch disease**: This is a bacterial infection that can cause swollen lymph nodes in the armpit.\n*   **Lipomas**: These are harmless fatty growths that can occur under the skin in the armpit.\n*   **Medicines or vaccinations**: Certain medicines or vaccinations can cause lumps in the armpit as a side effect.\n*   **Cysts or abscesses**: These can be caused by bacterial infections and can produce large, painful lumps in the armpit.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf you have an unexplained armpit lump, it's always best to contact a medical professional for advice. An armpit lump in a woman may be a sign of breast cancer, and it should be checked by a provider right away.\n\n**Home Care**\n\nHome care depends on the reason for the lump. Check with your health care provider to determine the cause. In some cases, home care may involve applying heat or cold packs to reduce swelling, taking over-the-counter pain relievers, or practicing good hygiene to prevent infection.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nWhen you visit your healthcare provider, they will examine you and gently press on the nodes. You will be asked questions about your medical history and symptoms, such as:\n\n*   When did you first notice the lump? Has the lump changed?\n*   Are you breastfeeding?\n*   Is there anything that makes the lump worse?\n*   Is the lump painful?\n*   Do you have any other symptoms?\n\nYou may need more tests, depending on the results of your physical exam.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nArmpit lumps are also known by several other names, including:\n\n*   Lump in the armpit\n*   Localized lymphadenopathy - armpit\n*   Axillary lymphadenopathy\n*   Axillary lymph enlargement\n*   Lymph nodes enlargement - axillary\n*   Axillary abscess",

    "content": "**Arnica**\n\n**What is it?**\nArnica is an herb sometimes used to flavor foods. It can be poisonous when consumed in larger amounts. Arnica gel can be applied to the skin for osteoarthritis.\n\nThe active chemicals in arnica may reduce swelling, decrease pain, and act as antibiotics. But arnica can be unsafe when taken by mouth unless it's used in homeopathic dilutions. Homeopathic products contain extreme dilutions of the active chemicals.\n\nPeople most commonly use arnica for pain caused by osteoarthritis. It is also used for bleeding, bruising, swelling after surgery, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Arnica is also used as a flavor ingredient in beverages, candy, baked goods, and other foods.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\nNatural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\n\nThe effectiveness ratings for ARNICA are as follows:\n\nPossibly effective for...\nOsteoarthritis. Applying an arnica gel (A. Vogel Arnica Gel, Bioforce AG) twice daily for 3 weeks can reduce pain and stiffness and improve function in people with osteoarthritis in the hand or knee. It might work as well as ibuprofen.\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: Homeopathic arnica is possibly safe. Homeopathic products often contain no active ingredient, so side effects are unlikely. It is also possibly safe to take arnica in the amounts found in food. But the Canadian government is concerned enough about its safety to prohibit its use in food.\n\nTaking arnica in amounts more than what is found in food is likely unsafe. In fact, arnica is considered poisonous. When taken by mouth it can cause vomiting, heart damage, organ failure, increased bleeding, coma, and death.\n\nWhen applied to the skin: Arnica is possibly safe when applied to unbroken skin, short-term. But it is likely unsafe to apply arnica to broken skin because it can be absorbed into the body.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n* Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Don't take arnica by mouth or apply it to the skin if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. It is considered likely unsafe.\n* Allergy to ragweed and related plants: Arnica may cause an allergic reaction in people who are sensitive to the Asteraceae/Compositae family. Members of this family include ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, daisies, and many others. If you have allergies, be sure to check with your healthcare provider before applying arnica to your skin. Do not take arnica by mouth.\n* Surgery: Arnica might cause extra bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using it at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.\n\n---\n\n**Arnica: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Allergies and Interactions**\n\nIf you have allergies, be sure to check with your healthcare provider before applying arnica to your skin. Do not take arnica by mouth.\n\n**Surgery**\n\nArnica might cause extra bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using it at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.\n\n* **Medications that slow blood clotting (Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet drugs)**: Arnica might slow blood clotting. Taking arnica along with medications that also slow blood clotting might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding.\n* **Herbs and supplements that might slow blood clotting**: Arnica might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might increase the risk of bleeding in some people. Examples of supplements with this effect include garlic, ginger, ginkgo, nattokinase, and Panax ginseng.\n\n**Typical Use**\n\nArnica has most often been used by adults in homeopathic dilutions. Typical homeopathic arnica products are 5C-30C dilutions. The \"C\" means that the active ingredient was initially diluted by 100-fold. The \"5\" or \"30\" means that the resulting dilution is then diluted again by 100-fold, 5 or 30 more times.\n\nArnica is also used in gels, creams, and ointments. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what dose or product might be best for a specific condition.\n\n**Other Names**\n\nAmerican Arnica, Arctic Arnica, Arnica angustifolia, Arnica chamissonis, Arnica cordifolia, Arnica des Montagnes, Arnica Flos, Arnica Flower, Arnica fulgens, Arnica latifolia, Arnica montana, Arnica sororia, Arnikablüten, Bergwohlverleih, Doronic d'Allemagne, European Arnica, Fleurs d'Arnica, Foothill Arnica, Heart-Leaf Arnica, Herbe aux Chutes, Herbe aux Prêcheurs, Hillside Arnica, Kraftwurz, Leopard's Bane, Mountain Arnica, Mountain Snuff, Mountain Tobacco, North American Meadow Arnica, Plantin des Alpes, Quinquina des Pauvres, Souci des Alpes, Tabac des Savoyards, Tabac des Vosges, Twin Arnica, Wolf's Bane, Wolfsbane, Wundkraut.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nTo learn more about how this article was written, please see the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database methodology.\n\n---\n\n**Arnica: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 3/3)**\n\n\\n\\n* **Effectiveness of hyaluronic acid and arnica extract ophthalmic solution in reducing dry eye symptoms in pediatric population**: Tti L, Petroni S, Federici M.

These individuals typically have normal internal reproductive organs, but develop ovarian cysts early in childhood, which impair the release of egg cells from the ovaries (ovulation). In adolescence, most affected females do not develop secondary sexual characteristics, such as breast growth and menstrual periods. They tend to develop acne and excessive body hair growth (hirsutism).\n\n**Symptoms in Males**\n\nMen with this condition have a typical male chromosome pattern (46,XY) and are born with male external genitalia. Some men with this condition have decreased sex drive, abnormal sperm production, or testes that are small or undescended (cryptorchidism).\n\n**Other Features Associated with Aromatase Deficiency**\n\nAffected individuals are abnormally tall because of excessive growth of long bones in the arms and legs. The abnormal bone growth results in slowed mineralization of bones (delayed bone age) and thinning of the bones (osteoporosis), which can lead to bone fractures with little trauma. In affected individuals, the body does not respond correctly to the hormone insulin, so people with aromatase deficiency can have abnormally high blood sugar (glucose), a condition known as hyperglycemia. In addition, people with armoatase deficiency can have excessive weight gain and a fatty liver.\n\n**Symptoms in Pregnant Women**\n\nWomen who are pregnant with fetuses that have aromatase deficiency often experience mild symptoms of the disorder even though they themselves do not have the disorder. These women may develop hirsutism, acne, an enlarged clitoris (clitoromegaly), and a deep voice. These features can appear as early as 12 weeks of pregnancy and go away soon after delivery.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the CYP19A1 gene cause aromatase deficiency. The CYP19A1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aromatase. This enzyme converts a class of hormones called androgens, which are involved in male sexual development, to different forms of estrogen. In females, estrogen guides female sexual development before birth and during puberty. In both males and females, estrogen plays a role in regulating bone growth and blood glucose levels.\n\n**Prevalence**\n\nThe prevalence of aromatase deficiency is unknown; approximately 20 cases have been described in the medical literature.\n\n---\n\n**Aromatase Deficiency**\n\n_A rare genetic disorder affecting estrogen production_\n\nIn this article, we'll delve into the world of aromatase deficiency, a rare genetic disorder that affects estrogen production in the body.\n\n**What is Aromatase Deficiency?**\n\nAromatase deficiency is a condition where the enzyme aromatase is either deficient or absent. This enzyme plays a crucial role in converting androgens to estrogens in the body. Without sufficient aromatase, the levels of estrogen decrease, while the levels of androgens, such as testosterone, increase.\n\n**Symptoms of Aromatase Deficiency**\n\nThe symptoms of aromatase deficiency can vary depending on the individual and the severity of the condition. Some common symptoms include:\n\n* Impaired female sexual development\n* Unusual bone growth\n* Insulin resistance\n* Virilization (masculinization) in females\n\n**Causes of Aromatase Deficiency**\n\nAromatase deficiency is caused by mutations in the CYP19A1 gene, which codes for the aromatase enzyme. These mutations can lead to a reduction or complete loss of aromatase activity.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nAromatase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with this condition typically carry one copy of the mutated gene and do not show symptoms themselves.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nThis condition is also known by other names, including:\n\n* 46,XX disorder of sex development (DSD) due to placental aromatase deficiency\n* Estrogen synthetase deficiency\n* Oestrogen synthetase deficiency\n* Placental aromatase deficiency\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on aromatase deficiency, you can visit the following resources:\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Aromatase deficiency\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Aromatase deficiency\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: AROMATASE DEFICIENCY\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed: Search for articles on aromatase deficiency\n\n**References**\n\nFor further reading, check out the following references:\n\n* Baykan EK, Erdogan M, Ozen S, Darcan S, Saygili LF.

It is more prevalent in certain Asian populations, particularly among people from Taiwan, Japan, and China.\n\n**Causes of AADC deficiency**\n\nVariants (also called mutations) in the DDC gene cause AADC deficiency. The DDC gene provides instructions for making the AADC enzyme, which plays an important role in the nervous system. Within neurons, the AADC enzyme helps produce dopamine and serotonin, two types of neurotransmitters.\n\n**Inheritance pattern of AADC deficiency**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other names for AADC deficiency**\n\n* AADCD\n* DDC deficiency\n* Dopa decarboxylase deficiency\n\n**Additional information & resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Information: Deficiency of aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase (available through the Genetic Testing Registry)\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n\t+ National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n---\n\n**Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency**\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   AROMATIC L-AMINO ACID DECARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCY; AADCD\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Deficiency of aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency\n*   Patient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n    *   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   Clinical Trials:\n    *   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n    *   AROMATIC L-AMINO ACID DECARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCY; AADCD\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n\n**References**\n\nExpand Section\n\n1.

    "content": "**Arrhythmia | Irregular Heartbeat**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Basics**\n**Summary**\n**Start Here**\n\nAn arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. Your heart beats too quickly, too slowly, or with an irregular pattern. Changes in the electrical signals that control your heartbeat cause arrhythmias.\n\nWhen your heart beats faster than normal, it's called tachycardia.\nWhen your heart beats too slowly, it's called bradycardia.\nWhen the signal to beat comes too early, it's called a premature or extra heartbeat. It may feel like your heart skipped a beat.\n\nThere are many types of arrhythmias. Arrhythmias may affect the upper or lower chamber of your heart. The most common type of arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation, which causes an irregular and fast heartbeat.\n\nSome arrhythmias are harmless, such as when your heart rate speeds up during exercise and slows down when you sleep. But if you have a frequent irregular rhythm, it may mean your heart isn't pumping enough blood into your body. Getting treatment and following a heart-healthy lifestyle can help control arrhythmias. It may also help prevent heart damage that can trigger some heart arrhythmias.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What causes an arrhythmia?**\n\nMany factors can affect your heart's rhythm, such as having had a heart attack, smoking, congenital heart defects, and stress. Other factors that could increase your risk for some types of arrhythmias could include if you:\n\nHave a family history of arrhythmias.\nHave certain health conditions, which can include heart and blood vessel diseases, lung diseases, kidney diseases, obesity, and sleep apnea.\nAre an older adult.\nHave had recent surgery for your heart, lungs, or throat.\nTake certain medicines for other health conditions.\nUse illegal drugs.\n\nIf you have risk factors, some situations that make your heart work harder, raise your blood pressure, or cause strong emotional stress may trigger an arrhythmia.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the symptoms of an arrhythmia?**\n\nYou may not have any noticeable symptoms of an arrhythmia. Your provider may find an arrhythmia during your routine checkup. Symptoms of an arrhythmia can include:\n\nFast or slow heartbeat\nSkipping, fluttering, or pounding heartbeats\nChest pain or discomfort\nDizziness or fainting\nShortness of breath\nSweating\nTiredness or weakness\n\nSeek emergency medical care if you have chest pain, shortness of breath, or think you are having a heart attack.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is an arrhythmia diagnosed?**\n\nTo find out if you have an arrhythmia, your health care provider may order an electrocardiogram (EKG). This test records your heart's electrical activity and is the most common for finding an arrhythmia. Your provider may also:\n\nAsk about your medical history, including your symptoms and lifestyle habits.\nDo a physical exam, which includes checking your heartbeat and pulse.\nOrder blood tests and other heart tests.\nCheck your legs or feet for swelling.\nLook for signs of other health conditions that could cause an arrythmia, such as thyroid disease.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the treatments for an arrhythmia?**\n\nTreatment may include medicines, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or pacemaker, or sometimes surgery. Your provider may also recommend avoiding activities that may trigger your arrhythmia.\n\nThe goal of treatment is to restore a normal heart rhythm. If not treated, arrhythmias can damage your heart, brain, and other organs and could be life-threatening.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Can arrhythmias be prevented?**\n\nTo help prevent an arrhythmia, your provider may suggest that you make heart-healthy lifestyle changes and treat health conditions that may cause arrhythmias.\n\n---\n\n**Arrhythmia | Irregular Heartbeat**\n\n**What is an Arrhythmia?**\n\nAn arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat.

Some common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Rapid or irregular heartbeat**: This is one of the most common symptoms of an arrhythmia.\n*   **Shortness of breath**: In some cases, an arrhythmia can cause shortness of breath due to the heart's inability to pump blood efficiently.\n*   **Fatigue**: Arrhythmias can also cause fatigue, as the heart has to work harder to pump blood.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nTo diagnose an arrhythmia, a healthcare provider will typically perform a physical exam and take a thorough medical history. They may also use various tests, including:\n\n*   **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: This test measures the electrical activity of the heart.\n*   **Echocardiogram**: This test uses sound waves to create images of the heart.\n*   **Stress test**: This test measures the heart's response to exercise.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for an arrhythmia will depend on the type and severity of the condition. Some common treatments include:\n\n*   **Medications**: In some cases, medications may be used to slow or regulate the heartbeat.\n*   **Pacemakers**: A pacemaker is a small device that is implanted in the chest to help regulate the heartbeat.\n*   **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to correct an arrhythmia.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile some arrhythmias cannot be prevented, there are steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing certain types of arrhythmias. These include:\n\n*   **Maintaining a healthy lifestyle**: Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and not smoking can all help reduce the risk of arrhythmias.\n*   **Managing underlying medical conditions**: Conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes should be closely monitored and managed to reduce the risk of arrhythmias.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   Arrhythmia",

    "content": "**Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)**\n\n**Description**\n\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a form of heart disease that usually appears in adulthood. It's a disorder of the myocardium, which is the muscular wall of the heart. This condition causes part of the myocardium to break down over time, increasing the risk of an abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia) and sudden death.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nARVC may not cause any symptoms in its early stages. However, affected individuals may still be at risk of sudden death, especially during strenuous exercise. When symptoms occur, they most commonly include a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations), light-headedness, and fainting (syncope). Over time, ARVC can also cause shortness of breath and abnormal swelling in the legs or abdomen. If the myocardium becomes severely damaged in the later stages of the disease, it can lead to heart failure.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nARVC occurs in an estimated 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 1,250 people. This disorder may be underdiagnosed because it can be difficult to detect in people with mild or no symptoms.\n\n**Causes**\n\nARVC can result from mutations in at least 13 genes. Many of these genes are known as desmosomal genes because they provide instructions for making components of cell structures called desmosomes. Desmosomes attach heart muscle cells to one another, providing strength to the myocardium and playing a role in signaling between neighboring cells.\n\nMutations in desmosomal genes impair the function of desmosomes. Without normal desmosomes, cells of the myocardium detach from one another and die, particularly when the heart muscle is placed under stress (such as during vigorous exercise). These changes primarily affect the myocardium surrounding the right ventricle, one of the two lower chambers of the heart.\n\nThe damaged myocardium is gradually replaced by fat and scar tissue. As this abnormal tissue builds up, the walls of the right ventricle become stretched out, preventing the heart from pumping blood effectively. These changes also disrupt the electrical signals that control the heartbeat, which can lead to arrhythmia.\n\nLess commonly, mutations in non-desmosomal genes can cause ARVC. These genes have a variety of functions, including cell signaling, providing structure and stability to heart muscle cells, and helping to maintain a normal heart rhythm. Researchers are working to determine how mutations in non-desmosomal genes can lead to ARVC.\n\nGene mutations have been found in about 60 percent of people with ARVC. Mutations in a desmosomal gene called PKP2 appear to be most common. In people without an identified mutation, the cause of the disorder is unknown. Researchers are looking for additional genetic factors that play a role in causing ARVC.\n\n---\n\n**Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy**\n\n**Genetic Basis**\n\nARVC can result from mutations in at least 13 genes. Many of these genes are known as desmosomal genes because they provide instructions for making components of cell structures called desmosomes.\n\n* DES\n* DSC2\n* DSP\n* JUP\n* LMNA\n* PKP2\n* RYR2\n* TGFB3\n* TTN\n\nThese genes have a variety of functions, including:\n\n* Cell signaling\n* Providing structure and stability to heart muscle cells\n* Helping to maintain a normal heart rhythm\n\n**Impact of Mutations**\n\nMutations in desmosomal genes impair the function of desmosomes. Without normal desmosomes, cells of the myocardium detach from one another and die, particularly when the heart muscle is placed under stress (such as during vigorous exercise).\n\nThese changes primarily affect the myocardium surrounding the right ventricle, one of the two lower chambers of the heart. The damaged myocardium is gradually replaced by fat and scar tissue.\n\nAs this abnormal tissue builds up, the walls of the right ventricle become stretched out, preventing the heart from pumping blood effectively. These changes also disrupt the electrical signals that control the heartbeat, which can lead to arrhythmia.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nUp to half of all cases of ARVC appear to run in families. Most familial cases of the disease have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\nRarely, ARVC has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n---\n\n**Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy**\n\n**What is Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy?**\n\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a disorder of the heart muscle that can cause abnormal heart rhythms, also known as arrhythmias. It is characterized by the replacement of healthy heart tissue with scar tissue, which can lead to sudden cardiac death.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact causes of ARVC are still not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to genetic mutations that affect the structure and function of the heart muscle. Rarely, ARVC has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, meaning both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of ARVC may include:\n\n* Abnormal heart rhythms\n* Shortness of breath\n* Fatigue\n* Dizziness or lightheadedness\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing ARVC can be challenging and often requires a combination of clinical evaluation, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, and genetic testing. Genetic testing can help identify individuals with a family history of the disorder.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for ARVC typically involves medications to regulate heart rhythms, as well as lifestyle modifications such as avoiding strenuous exercise. In some cases, implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator (CVD) may be necessary to prevent sudden cardiac death.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy-dysplasia\n* Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia\n* Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy\n* ARVC\n* ARVD\n* ARVD/C\n* Right ventricular dysplasia, arrhythmogenic\n* Ventricular dysplasia, right, arrhythmogenic\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, familial, 11, with mild palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, familial, 7\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n---\n\n**Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy**\n\n**Overview**\n\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a genetic disorder that affects the heart's electrical system, leading to abnormal heart rhythms. It is characterized by fatty infiltration and fibrosis of the right ventricle, which can lead to sudden cardiac death.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nARVC is caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in the structure and function of the heart muscle cells. The most common affected gene is the PKP2 gene, but other genes such as PLN, LAMP2, and CAV3 are also implicated. Family history plays a significant role in the development of ARVC, with approximately 50% of cases having a familial component.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of ARVC can vary widely among individuals, but common manifestations include:\n\n*   **Palpitations**: Episodes of rapid or irregular heartbeat\n*   **Shortness of breath**: Difficulty breathing due to decreased cardiac output\n*   **Fatigue**: Feeling tired or exhausted due to reduced physical performance\n*   **Dizziness or lightheadedness**: Feeling faint or disoriented due to decreased blood flow to the brain\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThe diagnosis of ARVC is typically made through a combination of:\n\n1.  **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: An ECG can show abnormal heart rhythms, such as ventricular tachycardia.\n2.  **Echocardiogram**: An echocardiogram can reveal structural abnormalities in the right ventricle, such as fatty infiltration and fibrosis.\n3.  **Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: A cardiac MRI can provide detailed images of the heart's structure and function.\n4.  **Genetic testing**: Genetic testing can identify mutations in genes associated with ARVC.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment of ARVC depends on the severity of symptoms and the presence of structural abnormalities. Treatment options may include:\n\n*   **Anti-arrhythmic medications**: Medications that help regulate abnormal heart rhythms.\n*   **Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)**: A device implanted under the skin to detect and correct life-threatening arrhythmias.\n*   **Catheter ablation**: A procedure that uses radiofrequency energy to destroy abnormal electrical pathways in the heart.\n*   **Heart transplant**: In severe cases, a heart transplant may be necessary.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis of ARVC varies widely among individuals, depending on the severity of symptoms and the presence of structural abnormalities. With proper treatment and management, many people with ARVC can lead active and fulfilling lives. However, sudden cardiac death remains a significant risk, particularly in individuals with severe structural abnormalities or a family history of ARVC.\n\n---\n\n**Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy**\n\n\\n\\n* **What is Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy?**\n\t+ A rare heart condition characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the heart, leading to arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.\n* **Causes and Risk Factors**\n\t+ Genetic mutations affecting the desmosome proteins, particularly plakoglobin, plakophilin 2, and desmoplakin.\n\t+ Family history of the condition.\n* **Symptoms**\n\t+ Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias).\n\t+ Shortness of breath.\n\t+ Fatigue.\n\t+ Palpitations.\n* **Diagnosis**\n\t+ Electrocardiogram (ECG) to detect abnormal heart rhythms.\n\t+ Echocardiogram to visualize the heart's structure and function.\n\t+ Genetic testing to identify specific mutations.\n* **Treatment and Management**\n\t+ Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) to prevent sudden cardiac death.\n\t+ Anti-arrhythmic medications to control abnormal heart rhythms.\n\t+ Lifestyle modifications, such as regular exercise and a healthy diet.\n\nNote: The original content included code blocks, ads, disclaimers, and standalone URLs, which were removed according to the formatting rules.

    "content": "**Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Test**\n\nWhat is an arterial blood gas test?\n\nAn arterial blood gas (ABG) test measures the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood. It also checks the acidity of your blood, known as your acid-base balance or pH level.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe blood sample is taken from an artery, which carries oxygen-rich blood from your lungs to your body. The ABG test shows how well your lungs move oxygen into your blood and remove carbon dioxide when you breathe out.\n\nWhat are the risks of an arterial blood gas test?\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood oxygen level test. You may experience some bleeding, bruising, or soreness at the puncture site. Rarely, the needle may damage a nerve or the artery.\n\nHow do I prepare for the test?\n\nIf you take blood thinners, including aspirin, ask your healthcare provider if you should stop taking them before the test. Also, inform your provider about all other medicines and supplements you take. If you're on oxygen therapy, your oxygen may be turned off for 20 minutes before the test.\n\nWhat do the results mean?\n\nABG test results involve many body systems that affect each other. Abnormal results may indicate a problem with your lungs or kidneys or a metabolic disorder. Your healthcare provider will explain what your results mean for your health.\n\nIs there anything else I need to know about blood oxygen level tests?\n\nPulse oximetry is another type of test that can check your blood oxygen saturation levels using a small clip-like device attached to your finger. Ask your provider if this test is right for you.\n\n---\n\n**Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Test**\n\n**What is an Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Test?**\n\nAn arterial blood gas (ABG) test measures the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood. It also checks the acidity of your blood, which is called your acid-base balance or pH level.\n\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\nFor this test, a healthcare provider will take a sample of blood from an artery. The sample is usually taken from an artery on the inside of your wrist, but it may be taken from an artery in your arm or groin. For a newborn, the sample may be taken from the baby's heel or the umbilical cord shortly after birth.\n\n**What Happens During the Test?**\n\nThe provider will first test your blood circulation by applying pressure to the arteries to cut off blood flow to your hand for several seconds. Then they will let go of your wrist to check how quickly blood flow returns to your hand. If your blood flow is normal, the provider will collect a blood sample.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nIf you take blood thinners, including aspirin, ask your healthcare provider whether you should stop taking them before your test. And tell your provider about all other medicines and supplements you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood oxygen level test. You may have some bleeding, bruising, or soreness at the spot where the needle was put in. Very rarely, the needle may damage a nerve or the artery. You may be told to avoid lifting heavy objects for 24 hours after the test.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nABG test results involve many body systems that affect each other. And there are many health conditions that can cause abnormal results. For these reasons, it's best to have your provider explain what your results mean for your health.\n\nYour ABG test results will list many measurements, including:\n\n* Oxygen saturation (O2Sat)\n* Partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)\n* Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2)\n* Acid-base balance (pH level)\n\nThese measurements help show how well your lungs are moving oxygen from the air into your blood and how easily carbon dioxide can move out of your body.\n\n---\n\n**Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Test**\n\n**What is an Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Test?**\n\nAn ABG test measures the acidity of your blood. Too much acid is called acidosis, and too much base (alkaline) is called alkalosis. These conditions are symptoms of other problems that upset the acid-base balance in your body.\n\n**What Does an ABG Test Involve?**\n\nAn ABG test alone usually can't provide a final diagnosis. So, if your results are not normal, your provider will likely order more tests to make a diagnosis. In general, abnormal results may mean you have a problem with your lungs or kidneys or a metabolic disorder. Metabolic disorders affect how your body uses food for energy. Certain medicines may also upset your acid-base balance and lead to abnormal ABG test results.\n\n**Understanding Your ABG Test Results**\n\nYour ABG test results will list many measurements, including:\n\n*   pH: measures the acidity of your blood\n*   PaCO2: measures the amount of carbon dioxide in your blood\n*   HCO3-: measures the amount of bicarbonate in your blood\n*   Base excess (BE): measures the difference between the actual and normal bicarbonate levels in your blood\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About Blood Oxygen Level Tests?**\n\nAnother type of test, called pulse oximetry, can check your blood oxygen saturation levels. A small clip-like device, called a pulse oximeter, is usually attached to your finger. The device tells you the percentage of red blood cells that are full of oxygen. Pulse oximetry may be useful if blood oxygen levels are the only concern. Ask your provider if this test is right for you.\n\n**References**\n\n*   American Lung Association.

    "content": "**Arterial Embolism**\n\nArterial embolism refers to a clot (embolus) that has come from another part of the body and causes a sudden interruption of blood flow to an organ or body part.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAn \"embolus\" is a blood clot or a piece of atherosclerotic plaque that acts like a clot. The word \"emboli\" means there is more than one clot or piece of plaque. When the clot travels from the site where it formed to another location in the body, it is called an embolism.\n\nAn arterial embolism may be caused by one or more clots. The clots can get stuck in an artery and block blood flow. The blockage starves tissues of blood and oxygen. This can result in damage or tissue death (necrosis).\n\nArterial emboli often occur in the legs and feet. Emboli that occur in the brain cause a stroke. Ones that occur in the heart cause a heart attack. Other sites include the kidneys, intestines, and eyes.\n\nRisk factors for arterial embolism include:\n\n* Abnormal heart rhythms such as atrial fibrillation\n* Injury or damage to an artery wall\n* Conditions that increase blood clotting\n\nAnother condition that poses a high risk for embolization (especially to the brain) is mitral stenosis. Endocarditis (infection of the inside of the heart) can also cause arterial emboli.\n\nA common source for an embolus is from areas of hardening (atherosclerosis causing plaque) in the aorta and other large blood vessels. These clots can break loose and flow down to the abdominal organs, legs and feet.\n\nParadoxical embolization can take place when a clot in a vein enters the right side of the heart and passes through a hole into the left side of the heart. The clot can then move to an artery and block blood flow to the brain (stroke) or other organs.\n\nIf a clot travels and lodges in the arteries supplying blood flow to the lungs, it is called a pulmonary embolus.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nYou may not have any symptoms.\n\nSymptoms may begin quickly or slowly depending on the size of the embolus and how much it blocks the blood flow.\n\nSymptoms of an arterial embolism in the arms or legs may include:\n\n* Cold arm or leg\n* Decreased or no pulse in an arm or leg\n* Lack of movement in the arm or leg\n* Pain in the affected area\n* Numbness and tingling in the arm or leg\n* Pale color of the arm or leg (pallor)\n* Weakness of an arm or leg\n\nLater symptoms:\n\n* Blisters of the skin fed by the affected artery\n* Shedding (sloughing) of skin\n* Skin erosion (ulcer)\n* Tissue death (necrosis; skin is dark and damaged)\n\nSymptoms of a clot in an organ vary with the organ involved but may include:\n\n* Pain in the part of the body that is involved\n* Temporarily decreased organ function\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider may find decreased or no pulse, and decreased or no blood pressure in the arm or leg. There may be signs of tissue death or gangrene.\n\nTests to diagnose arterial embolism or reveal the source of emboli may include:\n\n* Angiography of the affected extremity or organ\n* Doppler ultrasound exam of an extremity\n* Duplex Doppler ultrasound exam of an extremity\n* Duplex Doppler ultrasound exam of arteries to the brain\n* Echocardiogram\n* MRI of the arm or leg\n* Myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE)\n* Plethysmography\n* Transcranial Doppler exam of arteries to the brain\n* Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)\n\nThis disease may also affect the results of the following tests:\n\n* D-dimer\n* Factor VIII assay\n* Isotope study of the affected organ\n* Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity\n* Platelet aggregation test\n* Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) levels\n\n**Treatment**\n\nArterial embolism requires prompt treatment at a hospital. The goals of treatment are to control symptoms and to improve the interrupted blood flow to the affected area of the body. The cause of the clot, if found, should be treated to prevent further problems.\n\nMedicines include:\n\n* Anticoagulants (such as warfarin or heparin or one of the newer blood thinners such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or dabigatran) can prevent new clots from forming\n* Antiplatelet medicines (such as aspirin or clopidogrel) can prevent new clots from forming\n* Painkillers given through a vein (by IV)\n* Thrombolytics (such as streptokinase or tissue-type plasminogen activator) can dissolve clots\n\nSome people need surgery. Procedures include:\n\n* Bypass of the artery (arterial bypass) to create a second source of blood supply\n* Clot removal through a balloon catheter placed into the affected artery or through open surgery on the artery (embolectomy)\n* Opening of the artery with a balloon catheter (angioplasty) with or without a stent\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well a person does depends on the location of the clot and how much the clot has blocked blood flow and for how long the blockage has been present. Arterial embolism can be very serious if not treated promptly.\n\nThe affected area can be permanently damaged. Amputation is needed in up to 1 in 4 cases.\n\nArterial emboli can come back even after successful treatment.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Acute MI (heart attack)\n* Infection in the affected tissue\n* Septic shock\n* Stroke (CVA)\n* Temporary or permanent decrease or loss of other organ functions\n* Temporary or permanent kidney failure\n* Tissue death (necrosis) and gangrene\n* Transient ischemic attack (TIA)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nGo to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have symptoms of arterial embolism.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nPrevention begins with finding possible sources of a blood clot. Your provider may prescribe blood thinners (such as warfarin or heparin) to prevent clots from forming. Antiplatelet drugs may also be needed.\n\nYou have a higher risk atherosclerosis and clots if you:\n\n* Smoke\n* Do little exercise\n* Have high blood pressure\n* Have abnormal cholesterol levels\n* Have diabetes\n* Are overweight\n* Are stressed\n\n---\n\n**Arterial Embolism**\n\nAn arterial embolism refers to a clot (embolus) that has come from another part of the body and causes a sudden interruption of blood flow to an organ or body part.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAn \"embolus\" is a blood clot or a piece of atherosclerotic plaque that acts like a clot.

    "content": "**Arterial Insufficiency**\n\nArterial insufficiency is any condition that slows or stops the flow of blood through your arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to other places in your body.\n\n**Causes**\n\nOne of the most common causes of arterial insufficiency is atherosclerosis or \"hardening of the arteries.\" Fatty material (called plaque) builds up on the walls of your arteries. This causes them to become narrow and stiff. As a result, it is hard for blood to flow through your arteries.\n\nBlood flow may be suddenly stopped due to a blood clot. Clots can form on the plaque or less often travel from another place such as the heart or other artery (also called embolus).\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms depend on where your arteries become narrowed:\n\n* If it affects your heart arteries, you may have chest pain (angina pectoris) or a heart attack.\n* If it affects your brain arteries, you may have a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke.\n* If it affects the arteries that bring blood to your legs, you may have frequent leg cramping when you walk called claudication.\n* If it affects the arteries in your belly area, you may have pain after you eat called abdominal angina (due to mesenteric ischemia).\n\n**References**\n\nGoodney PP.

    "content": "**Arterial Stick**\n\nAn arterial stick is the collection of blood from an artery for laboratory testing.\n\n**How the Test Is Performed**\n\nBlood is usually drawn from an artery in the wrist. It may also be drawn from an artery on the inside of the elbow, groin, or other site. If blood is drawn from the wrist, the health care provider will first check the pulse. This is to make sure blood is flowing into the hand from the main arteries in the forearm (radial and ulnar arteries).\n\nThe procedure is done as follows:\n\n*   The area is cleaned with antiseptic.\n*   A needle is inserted. A small amount of anesthetic may be injected or applied before the needle is inserted.\n*   Blood flows into a special collecting syringe.\n*   The needle is removed after enough blood is collected.\n*   Pressure is applied to the puncture site for 5 to 10 minutes to stop the bleeding. The site will be checked during this time to make sure the bleeding stops.\n\nIf it is easier to get blood from one location or side of your body, let the person who is drawing your blood know it before starting the test.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nPreparation varies with the specific test performed.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nPuncture of an artery may be more uncomfortable than puncture of a vein. This is because arteries are deeper than veins. Arteries also have thicker walls and have more nerves.\n\nWhen the needle is inserted, there may be some discomfort or pain. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\n\n**Why the Test Is Performed**\n\nBlood transports oxygen, nutrients, waste products, and other materials within the body. Blood also helps control body temperature, fluids, and the balance of chemicals.\n\nBlood is made up of a fluid portion (plasma) and a cellular portion. Plasma contains substances dissolved in the fluid. The cellular portion is made up mainly of red blood cells, but it also includes white blood cells and platelets.\n\nBecause blood has many functions, tests on the blood or its components may give valuable clues to help providers diagnose many medical conditions.\n\nBlood in the arteries (arterial blood) differs from blood in the veins (venous blood) mainly in its content of dissolved gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide). Testing arterial blood shows the makeup of the blood before any of its contents are used by the body tissues.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAn arterial stick is done to get blood samples from arteries. Blood samples are mainly taken to measure gases dissolved in the arterial blood. Abnormal results may point to breathing problems or problems with the body's metabolism. Sometimes arterial sticks are done to get blood culture (testing for infection) or blood chemistry samples.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk in having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:\n\n*   Excessive bleeding\n*   Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n*   Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n*   Multiple punctures to locate veins\n*   Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\nThere is a slight risk for damage to nearby tissues when the blood is drawn. Blood can be taken from lower-risk sites, and techniques can be used to limit tissue damage.\n\n---\n\n**Arterial Stick: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 2/3)**\n\n**How the Test Is Performed**\n\nBlood is usually drawn from an artery in the wrist.

    "content": "**Arterial Tortuosity Syndrome**\n\nArterial tortuosity syndrome is a disorder that affects connective tissue. Connective tissue provides strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body, including blood vessels, skin, joints, and the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n**Characteristics of Arterial Tortuosity Syndrome**\n\nAs its name suggests, arterial tortuosity syndrome is characterized by blood vessel abnormalities, particularly abnormal twists and turns (tortuosity) of the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the arteries). Tortuosity arises from abnormal elongation of the arteries; since the end points of the arteries are fixed, the extra length twists and curves. Other blood vessel abnormalities that may occur in this disorder include constriction (stenosis) and abnormal bulging (aneurysm) of vessels, as well as small clusters of enlarged blood vessels just under the skin (telangiectasia).\n\n**Complications**\n\nComplications resulting from the abnormal arteries can be life-threatening. Rupture of an aneurysm or sudden tearing (dissection) of the layers in an arterial wall can result in massive loss of blood from the circulatory system. Blockage of blood flow to vital organs such as the heart, lungs, or brain can lead to heart attacks, respiratory problems, and strokes. Stenosis of the arteries forces the heart to work harder to pump blood and may lead to heart failure.\n\n**Features Outside the Circulatory System**\n\nFeatures of arterial tortuosity syndrome outside the circulatory system are caused by abnormal connective tissue in other parts of the body. These features include joints that are either loose and very flexible (hypermobile) or that have deformities limiting movement (contractures), and unusually soft and stretchable skin. Some affected individuals have long, slender fingers and toes (arachnodactyly); curvature of the spine (scoliosis); or a chest that is either sunken (pectus excavatum) or protruding (pectus carinatum). They may have protrusion of organs through gaps in muscles (hernias), elongation of the intestines, or pouches called diverticula in the intestinal walls.\n\n**Distinctive Facial Features**\n\nPeople with arterial tortuosity syndrome often look older than their age and have distinctive facial features including a long, narrow face with droopy cheeks; eye openings that are narrowed (blepharophimosis) with outside corners that point downward (downslanting palpebral fissures); a beaked nose with soft cartilage; a high, arched roof of the mouth (palate); a small lower jaw (micrognathia); and large ears.

About 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nArterial tortuosity syndrome is caused by mutations in the SLC2A10 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called GLUT10. The level of GLUT10 appears to be involved in the regulation of a process called the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway. This pathway is involved in cell growth and division (proliferation) and the process by which cells mature to carry out special functions (differentiation). The TGF-β signaling pathway is also involved in bone and blood vessel development and the formation of the extracellular matrix, an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells and defines the structure and properties of connective tissues.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Mechanism of Action**\n\nSLC2A10 gene mutations that cause arterial tortuosity syndrome reduce or eliminate GLUT10 function. By mechanisms that are not well understood, a lack (deficiency) of functional GLUT10 protein leads to overactivity (upregulation) of TGF-β signaling. Excessive growth signaling results in elongation of the arteries, leading to tortuosity. Overactive TGF-β signaling also interferes with normal formation of the connective tissues in other parts of the body, leading to the additional signs and symptoms of arterial tortuosity syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**Arterial Tortuosity Syndrome**\n\n**Causes**\n\nArterial tortuosity syndrome is caused by mutations in the SLC2A10 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called GLUT10.\n\n**How it Works**\n\nThe level of GLUT10 appears to be involved in the regulation of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway.

Excessive growth signaling results in elongation of the arteries, leading to tortuosity.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nArterial tortuosity ATS\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Information\nGenetic and Rare Diseases Information Center\nPatient Support and Advocacy Resources\nClinical Trials\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\nScientific Articles on PubMed\n\n---\n\n**Arterial Tortuosity Syndrome**\n\n**What is Arterial Tortuosity Syndrome?**\n\nArterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the presence of arterial tortuosity, which can lead to various complications such as aneurysms, dissections, and stenosis.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nATS is caused by mutations in the SLC2A10 gene, which codes for a facilitative glucose transporter. The exact mechanism by which these mutations lead to arterial tortuosity is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve alterations in angiogenesis and vascular remodeling.\n\n**Symptoms and Signs**\n\nThe symptoms of ATS can vary widely depending on the severity and location of the arterial tortuosity. Common features include:\n\n* Arterial aneurysms\n* Dissections\n* Stenosis\n* Hypertension\n* Cardiopulmonary complications\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis of ATS is typically made through a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging studies (such as ultrasound or MRI), and genetic testing.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for ATS, but various treatments can help manage the symptoms and prevent complications. These may include:\n\n* Medications to control blood pressure\n* Antiplatelet therapy\n* Surgical intervention in cases of aneurysm or dissection\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with ATS varies widely depending on the severity of the condition, the presence of complications, and the effectiveness of treatment.\n\n**Genetic Considerations**\n\nATS is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that affected individuals must inherit two mutated copies of the SLC2A10 gene (one from each parent). Genetic counseling may be helpful for families with a history of ATS.",

Your vascular system is your body's network of blood vessels, including:\n\n* Arteries, which carry oxygen-rich blood from your heart to your tissues and organs.\n* Veins, which carry the blood and waste products back to your heart.\n* Capillaries, which are tiny blood vessels that connect your small arteries to your small veins.\n\nAn AVM is an abnormal tangle of arteries and veins. They are connected to each other, with no capillaries between them. Without the capillaries, the blood flow from the arteries goes directly into the veins at a faster rate than normal. Because of this, the nearby tissue does not get all the oxygen it would normally get. This lack of oxygen can lead to tissue damage and the death of nerve cells and other cells. The fast rate of blood flow can also increase the blood pressure inside the arteries and veins. This can weaken the arteries and veins. A weakened artery or blood vessel could burst or leak blood.\n\n**What causes arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)?**\n\nAVMs are rare. The cause of AVMs is unknown. Most of the time, people are born with them. But sometimes they can appear shortly after birth or later in life.\n\n**What are the symptoms of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)?**\n\nThe symptoms of AVM will depend on where the AVM is located. They can happen anywhere in the body, but they are more common in the brain or spinal cord. Most people with brain or spinal cord AVMs have few, if any, major symptoms. But if a weakened blood vessel bursts, it can spill blood into the brain (called a hemorrhage). Severe hemorrhages can cause a stroke and brain damage.\n\nIf an AVM is causing symptoms, they can include:\n\n* Seizures\n* Headache\n* Pain in the area where the AVM is located\n* Vision problems\n* Muscle weakness\n* Problems with movement and speech\n* Confusion\n* Dizziness\n* Loss of consciousness\n\n**How are arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) diagnosed?**\n\nTo find out if you have an AVM, your health care provider:\n\nWill ask about your symptoms and medical history.\nWill do a physical exam. This may include listening for a bruit. A bruit is whooshing sound caused by the rapid blood flow through the arteries and veins of an AVM.\nMay order imaging tests, such as a CT scan, MRI, ultrasound, or cerebral angiography. For a cerebral angiography, you are injected with a special dye that helps the blood vessels in your brain show up on x-rays.\n\n**What are the treatments for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)?**\n\nTreatments for AVMs will depend on factors such as:\n\nWhere the AVM is located\nIts size\nYour symptoms\nYour overall health\nYour risk of bleeding\n\nThe treatment options may include:\n\nMonitoring for any signs that may mean you have an increased risk of hemorrhage.\nMedicines to help with the symptoms from AVMs.\nSurgery, which may be done if you have a higher-than-usual risk of bleeding.

    "content": "**Arthritis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nArthritis involves the breakdown of structures of the joint, particularly cartilage. Normal cartilage protects a joint and allows it to move smoothly. Cartilage also absorbs shock when pressure is placed on the joint, such as when you walk. Without the normal amount of cartilage, the bones under the cartilage become damaged and rub together. This causes swelling (inflammation), and stiffness.\n\nOther joint structures affected by arthritis include:\n\n*   The synovium\n*   The bone next to the joint\n*   Ligaments and tendons\n*   Sacs that may be fluid-filled next to bone, ligaments and tendons (bursae)\n\nJoint inflammation and damage may result from:\n\n*   An autoimmune disease (the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue)\n*   Broken bone\n*   General \"wear and tear\" on joints\n*   Infection, most often by bacteria or viruses\n*   Crystals such as uric acid or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nArthritis causes joint pain, swelling, stiffness, and limited movement. Symptoms can include:\n\n*   Joint pain\n*   Joint swelling\n*   Joint deformity\n*   Reduced ability to move the joint\n*   Redness and warmth of the skin around a joint\n*   Joint stiffness, especially in the morning\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history.\n\nThe physical exam may show:\n\n*   Fluid in or around a joint\n*   Warm, red, tender joints\n*   Difficulty moving a joint (called \"limited range of motion\")\n\nSome types of arthritis may cause joint deformity. This may be a sign of severe, untreated rheumatoid arthritis or of osteoarthritis.\n\nBlood tests and joint x-rays are often done to check for infection and other causes of arthritis.\n\nThe provider may also remove a sample of joint fluid with a needle and send it to a lab to be checked for inflammation crystals or infection.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe underlying cause often cannot be cured. The goal of treatment is to:\n\n*   Reduce pain and inflammation\n*   Improve function\n*   Prevent further joint damage\n\nLIFESTYLE CHANGES\n\nLifestyle changes are the preferred treatment for osteoarthritis and other types of joint swelling. Exercise can help relieve stiffness, reduce pain and fatigue, and improve muscle and bone strength. Your health care team can help you design an exercise program that is best for you.\n\nExercise programs may include:\n\n*   Low-impact aerobic activity (also called endurance exercise) such as walking\n*   Range of motion exercises for flexibility\n*   Strength training for muscle tone\n\nYour provider may suggest physical therapy. This might include:\n\n*   Heat or ice.\n*   Splints or orthotics to support joints and help improve their position. This is often needed for rheumatoid arthritis.\n*   Water therapy.\n*   Massage.\n\nOther things you can do include:\n\n*   Get plenty of sleep. Sleeping 8 to 10 hours a night and taking naps during the day can help you recover from a flare-up more quickly, and may even help prevent flare-ups.\n*   Avoid staying in one position for too long.\n*   Avoid positions or movements that place extra stress on your sore joints.\n*   Change your home to make activities easier. For example, install grab bars in the shower, the tub, and near the toilet.\n*   Try stress-reducing activities, such as meditation, yoga, or tai chi.\n*   Eat a healthy diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables, which contain important vitamins and minerals.\n*   Eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as cold-water fish (salmon, mackerel, and herring), flaxseed, rapeseed (canola) oil, soybeans, soybean oil, pumpkin seeds, and walnuts.\n*   Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.\n*   Apply capsaicin cream over your painful joints. You may feel improvement after applying the cream for 3 to 7 days.\n*   Lose weight, if you are overweight. Weight loss can greatly improve joint pain in the legs and feet.\n*   Use a cane to reduce pain from hip, knee, ankle, or foot arthritis.\n\nMEDICINES\n\nMedicines may be prescribed along with lifestyle changes. All medicines have some risks. You should be closely followed by a provider when taking arthritis medicines, even ones you buy over-the-counter.\n\nOver-the-counter medicines:\n\n*   Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is often the first medicine tried to reduce pain. Take up to 3,000 mg a day (2 extra-strength Tylenol every 8 hours). To prevent damage to your liver, do not take more than the recommended dose. Since multiple medicines are available without a prescription that also contain acetaminophen, you will need to include them in the 3,000 mg per day maximum. Also, avoid alcohol when taking acetaminophen.\n*   Aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that can relieve arthritis pain. However, they can carry risks when used for a long time. Possible side effects include heart attack, stroke, stomach ulcers, bleeding from the digestive tract, and kidney damage.\n\nDepending on the type of arthritis, a number of other medicines may be prescribed:\n\n*   Corticosteroids (\"steroids\") help reduce inflammation. They may be injected into painful joints or given by mouth.\n*   Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are used to treat autoimmune arthritis and SLE\n*   Biologics and kinase inhibitors are used for the treatment of autoimmune arthritis. They may be given by injection or by mouth.\n*   For gout, certain medicines to lower uric acid levels may be used.\n\nIt is very important to take your medicines as directed by your provider. If you are having problems doing so (for example, because of side effects), you should talk to your provider. Also make sure your provider knows about all the medicines you are taking, including vitamins and supplements bought without a prescription.\n\nSURGERY AND OTHER TREATMENTS\n\nIn some cases, surgery may be done if other treatments have not worked and severe damage to a joint occurs. \n\nThis may include:\n\n*   Joint replacement, such as a total knee joint replacement\n\n---\n\n**Arthritis: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia**\n\n\\n\\n**Causes of Arthritis**\n\nArthritis involves the breakdown of structures of the joint, particularly cartilage.

There are over 100 types of arthritis, but the most common ones are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of Arthritis**\n\n*   **Osteoarthritis**: a degenerative joint disease that affects the cartilage in joints, causing pain and stiffness.\n*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis**: an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and damage to the joints, leading to pain, swelling, and deformity.\n*   **Psoriatic Arthritis**: a type of arthritis that occurs in people with psoriasis, causing joint pain, stiffness, and swelling.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nArthritis can be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Some risk factors include:\n\n*   Family history\n*   Age (arthritis becomes more common with age)\n*   Obesity\n*   Injuries or trauma to the joint\n*   Certain medical conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of arthritis can vary depending on the type and severity of the condition. Common symptoms include:\n\n*   Joint pain and stiffness\n*   Swelling and redness in the affected joints\n*   Limited range of motion in the affected joint\n*   Fatigue and weakness\n*   Loss of appetite\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing arthritis typically involves a physical examination, medical history, and diagnostic tests such as X-rays or MRI scans. In some cases, blood tests may be ordered to rule out other conditions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for arthritis depends on the type and severity of the condition. Common treatments include:\n\n*   Medications: pain relievers, anti-inflammatory medications, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)\n*   Physical therapy: exercises to improve range of motion and strengthen surrounding muscles\n*   Assistive devices: canes, walkers, or splints to help with mobility and balance\n*   Lifestyle changes: maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and getting enough rest\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent arthritis, some lifestyle changes may help reduce the risk of developing the condition. These include:\n\n*   Maintaining a healthy weight\n*   Exercising regularly\n*   Getting enough rest\n*   Eating a balanced diet\n*   Avoiding injuries or trauma to the joint\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   Arthritis\n*   Osteoarthritis\n*   Rheumatoid arthritis",

    "content": "**Artificial Urinary Sphincter**\n\nSphincters in the urinary system are muscles that allow your body to hold in urine. An inflatable artificial (man-made) sphincter is a medical device that keeps urine from leaking. It is used when your urinary sphincter no longer works well.\n\n**Other Procedures**\n\n*   Tension-free vaginal tape (midurethral sling) and autologous sling (women)\n*   Urethral bulking with artificial material (men and women)\n*   Retropubic suspension (women)\n*   Male urethral sling (men)\n\n**Description**\n\nThis procedure may be done while you are under:\n\n*   General anesthesia. You will be asleep and unable to feel pain.\n*   Spinal anesthesia. You will be awake but will not be able to feel anything below your waist. You will be given medicines to help you relax.\n\nAn artificial sphincter has 3 parts:\n\n1.  A cuff, which fits around your urethra. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from your bladder to the outside of your body. When the cuff is inflated (full), the cuff closes off your urethra to stop urine flow or leakage.\n2.  A balloon, which is placed under your belly muscles. It holds the same liquid as the cuff.\n3.  A pump, which relaxes the cuff by moving fluid from the cuff to the balloon.\n\nA surgical cut will be made in one of these areas so that the cuff can be put in place:\n\n*   Scrotum or perineum (men).\n*   Labia (women).\n*   Lower belly (men and women). In some cases, this incision may not be necessary.\n\nThe pump can be placed in a man's scrotum. It can also be placed underneath the skin in a woman's lower belly or leg.\n\nOnce the artificial sphincter is in place, you will use the pump to empty (deflate) the cuff. Squeezing the pump moves fluid from the cuff to the balloon. When the cuff is empty, your urethra opens so that you can urinate. The cuff will re-inflate on its own in 90 seconds.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nArtificial urinary sphincter surgery is done to treat stress incontinence. Stress incontinence is a leakage of urine, which occurs with activities such as walking, lifting, exercising, or even coughing or sneezing.\n\nThe procedure is recommended for men who have urine leakage with activity. This type of leakage can occur after prostate surgery. The artificial sphincter is advised when other treatments do not work.\n\nWomen who have urine leakage most often try other treatment options before having an artificial sphincter placed. It is rarely used to treat stress urinary incontinence in women in the United States.\n\nMost of the time, your doctor will recommend medicines and bladder retraining before surgery.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThis procedure is most often safe. Ask your provider about the possible complications.\n\nRisks related to anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n*   Reactions to medicines\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Bleeding, blood clots\n*   Infection\n\nRisks for this surgery may include:\n\n*   Damage to the urethra (at the time of surgery or later), bladder, or vagina\n*   Difficulty emptying your bladder, which may require a catheter\n*   Urine leakage that may get worse\n*   Failure or wearing away of the device that requires surgery to replace or remove it\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nAlways tell your doctor what medicines you are taking. Also let them know about the over-the-counter medicines, herbs and supplements that you bought without a prescription.\n\nDuring the days before the surgery:\n\nYou may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other medicines that make it hard for your blood to clot.\n\nAsk your doctor which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\n\nOn the day of your surgery:\n\nYou will usually be asked not to drink or eat anything for 6 to 12 hours before the surgery.\n\nTake the medicines your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water.\n\nYour doctor will tell you when to arrive at the hospital.\n\nYour doctor will test your urine. This will make sure you do not have a urinary infection before starting your surgery.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou may return from surgery with a urinary catheter in place. This catheter will drain urine from your bladder for a little while. It will be removed before you leave the hospital.\n\nYou will not use the artificial sphincter for a while after surgery. This means you will still have urine leakage. Your body tissues need this time to heal.\n\nAbout 6 weeks after surgery, you will be taught how to use your pump to inflate your artificial sphincter.\n\nYou will need to carry a wallet card or wear medical identification. This tells health care providers you have an artificial sphincter. The sphincter must be turned off if you need to have a urinary catheter placed.\n\nWomen may need to change how they do some activities (such as bicycle riding), since the pump is placed in the labia.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nUrinary leakage decreases for many people who have this procedure. However, there may still be some leakage. Over time, some or all of the leakage may come back.\n\nThere may be a slow wearing away of the urethra tissue under the cuff. This tissue may become spongy. This may make the device less effective or cause it to erode into the urethra. If your incontinence comes back, changes may be made to the device to correct it. If the device erodes into the urethra, it will need to be removed.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nArtificial sphincter (AUS) - urinary; Inflatable artificial sphincter\n\n---\n\n**Artificial Urinary Sphincter**\n\nThis procedure may be done while you are under:\n\n* **General Anesthesia**: You will be asleep and unable to feel pain.\n* **Spinal Anesthesia**: You will be awake but will not be able to feel anything below your waist.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/arts-syndrome/",
    "content": "**Arts Syndrome**\n\n**Description**\nArts syndrome is a disorder that causes serious neurological problems in males. Females can also be affected by this condition, but they typically have much milder symptoms.\n\nBoys with Arts syndrome have profound sensorineural hearing loss, which is a complete or almost complete loss of hearing caused by abnormalities in the inner ear. Other features of the disorder include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), developmental delay, and intellectual disability. In early childhood, affected boys develop vision loss caused by degeneration of nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain (optic nerve atrophy). They also experience loss of sensation and weakness in the limbs (peripheral neuropathy).\n\nBoys with Arts syndrome also usually have recurrent infections, especially involving the respiratory system. Because of these infections and their complications, affected boys often do not survive past early childhood.\n\nIn females with Arts syndrome, hearing loss that begins in adulthood may be the only symptom.\n\n**Frequency**\nArts syndrome appears to be extremely rare. Only a few families with this disorder have been described in the medical literature.\n\n**Causes**\nMutations in the PRPS1 gene cause Arts syndrome. The PRPS1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1, or PRPP synthetase 1. This enzyme is involved in producing purines and pyrimidines, which are building blocks of DNA, its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as ATP and GTP that serve as energy sources in the cell.\n\nThe PRPS1 gene mutations that cause Arts syndrome replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the PRPP synthetase 1 enzyme. The resulting enzyme is probably unstable, reducing or eliminating its ability to perform its function. The disruption of purine and pyrimidine production may impair energy storage and transport in cells. Impairment of these processes may have a particularly severe effect on tissues that require a large amount of energy, such as the nervous system, resulting in the neurological problems characteristic of Arts syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**Arts Syndrome**\n\n**What is Arts Syndrome?**\n\nArts syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects males and females differently due to its X-linked inheritance pattern.\n\n**Causes of Arts Syndrome**\n\nThe PRPS1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1, or PRPP synthetase 1. This enzyme is involved in producing purines and pyrimidines, which are building blocks of DNA, its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as ATP and GTP that serve as energy sources in the cell.\n\nMutations in the PRPS1 gene cause Arts syndrome by replacing single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the PRPP synthetase 1 enzyme. The resulting enzyme is probably unstable, reducing or eliminating its ability to perform its function. This disruption of purine and pyrimidine production may impair energy storage and transport in cells.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an X-linked pattern. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell sometimes causes features of the disorder; in other cases, these females do not experience any symptoms.\n\nIn the small number of Arts syndrome cases that have been identified, affected individuals have inherited the mutation from a mother who carries an altered copy of the PRPS1 gene.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAtaxia, fatal X-linked, with deafness and loss of vision\nAtaxia-deafness-optic atrophy, lethal\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Information:\nGenetic Testing Registry: Arts syndrome\nGenetic and Rare Diseases Information Center:\nLethal ataxia with deafness and optic atrophy\nPatient Support and Advocacy Resources:\nNational Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\nClinical Trials:\nClinicalTrials.gov\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\nARTS SYNDROME; ARTS\nScientific Articles on PubMed:\nPubMed\n\n**References**\n\nArts WF, Loonen MC, Sengers RC, Slooff JL.

It is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, including hearing loss, weakness, vision loss, and ataxia.\n\n**Causes of Arts Syndrome**\n\nArts syndrome is caused by mutations in the PRPS1 gene, which codes for an enzyme involved in the production of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP). PRPP is a crucial molecule in the biosynthesis of nucleotides. Loss-of-function mutations in the PRPS1 gene lead to a deficiency of the PRPS enzyme, resulting in the accumulation of toxic metabolites and subsequent damage to various tissues.\n\n**Symptoms of Arts Syndrome**\n\nThe symptoms of Arts syndrome can vary widely among affected individuals, but they often include:\n\n* Hearing loss\n* Weakness\n* Vision loss\n* Ataxia (uncoordinated movement)\n* Optic nerve atrophy\n\n**Treatment and Management of Arts Syndrome**\n\nThere is currently no cure for Arts syndrome, but treatment focuses on managing the symptoms and preventing further tissue damage. This may involve a combination of medications, physical therapy, and supportive care.\n\n**Prognosis of Arts Syndrome**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with Arts syndrome is generally poor, as the disorder can lead to severe disability and premature death. However, with proper management and support, some affected individuals may experience a better quality of life.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern of Arts Syndrome**\n\nArts syndrome is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, meaning that the mutated gene is located on the X chromosome and affects males more frequently than females. Females can be carriers of the mutation, while males are more likely to express the full spectrum of symptoms due to their single X chromosome.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Degenerative Nerve Diseases\n* Genetic Disorders\n* Optic Nerve Disorders",
