    "content": "**Diabetes - insulin therapy**\n\nInsulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to help the body use and store glucose (sugar). Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.\n\nIn people with diabetes, the body cannot regulate the amount of glucose in the blood (called glycemia or blood sugar). Insulin therapy can help some people with diabetes maintain their blood sugar levels.\n\n**Information**\n\nCarbohydrates from food are broken down into glucose and other sugars. Glucose is absorbed from the digestive tract into the bloodstream. Insulin lowers blood sugar by allowing it to move from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and other cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel. Insulin also tells the liver how much glucose to produce when you are fasting (have not had a recent meal).\n\nPeople with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body does not make enough insulin or because their body does not respond to insulin properly.\n\n* In people with type 1 diabetes, the pancreas produces little to no insulin.\n* In people with type 2 diabetes, the fat, liver, and muscle cells do not respond correctly to insulin. This is called insulin resistance. Over time, the pancreas stops making as much insulin.\n\n**Insulin Doses and Types**\n\nInsulin therapy replaces the insulin the body would normally make. People with type 1 diabetes must take insulin every day.\n\nPeople with type 2 diabetes need to take insulin when other treatments and medicines fail to control blood sugar levels.\n\nInsulin doses are given in two main ways:\n\n* Basal dose: provides a steady amount of insulin delivered all day and night. This helps maintain blood glucose levels by controlling how much glucose the liver releases (mainly at night when the time between meals is longer).\n* Bolus dose: provides a dose of insulin at meals to help move absorbed sugar from the blood into muscle and fat. Bolus doses can also help correct blood sugar when it gets too high. Bolus doses are also called nutritional or meal-time doses. Sometimes, a bolus dose must also be taken with large snacks.\n\nThere are several types of insulin available. Insulin types are based on the following factors:\n\n* Onset: how quickly it starts working after injection\n* Peak: time when the dose is the strongest and most effective\n* Duration: total time the insulin dose stays in the bloodstream and lowers blood sugar\n\nBelow are the different types of insulin:\n\n* Rapid-acting or fast-acting insulin starts working within 15 minutes, peaks in 1 hour, and lasts for 2 to 4 hours. It is taken right before or just after meals and snacks.\n* Regular or short-acting insulin reaches the bloodstream 30 minutes after use, peaks within 2 to 3 hours, and lasts 3 to 6 hours. This is taken a half-hour before meals and snacks.\n* Intermediate-acting insulin starts working within 2 to 4 hours, peaks in 4 to 12 hours, and lasts 12 to 18 hours. This is taken mostly either twice a day or once at bedtime.\n* Long-acting insulin starts to work a few hours after injection and works for about 24 hours, sometimes longer. It helps control glucose throughout the day. It is often combined with rapid- or short-acting insulin as needed.\n* Premixed or mixed insulin is a combination of 2 different types of insulin. It has both a basal and bolus dose to control glucose after meals and throughout the day.\n* Inhaled insulin is a rapid-acting breathable insulin powder that starts working within 15 minutes of use. It peaks 30 minutes after taking it and lasts about 3 hours. It is used just before meals.\n\nOne or more types of insulin may be used together to help control your blood sugar. You also may use insulin along with other diabetes medicines. Your health care provider will work with you to find the right combination of medications for you.\n\n**Ways to Take Insulin**\n\nInsulin cannot be taken by mouth because stomach acid destroys insulin. It is most often injected under the skin into fatty tissue. There are different insulin delivery methods available:\n\n* Insulin syringe: insulin is drawn from a vial into a syringe. Using the needle, you inject the insulin under the skin.\n* Insulin pen: disposable insulin pens have prefilled insulin delivered under the skin using a replaceable needle.\n* Insulin pump: a small machine worn on the body pumps insulin under the skin throughout the day. A small tube connects the pump to a small needle inserted into the skin.\n* Inhaler: a small device you use to inhale insulin powder through your mouth. It is used at the start of meals.\n* Injection port: a short tube is inserted into the tissue under the skin. The port containing tube is adhered to skin using adhesive tape. Fast-acting insulin is injected into the tube using a syringe or pen.\n\nYou should talk with your provider about your preferences when deciding on an insulin delivery method.\n\n**Insulin is injected into these sites on the body:**\n\n* Abdomen\n* Upper arm\n* Thighs\n* Hips\n\nYour provider will teach you how to give an insulin injection or use an insulin pump or other device. It is important not to always use the same site as this can decrease how effective the insulin is for you.\n\n**Points to Remember**\n\nYou need to know how to adjust the amount of insulin you are taking:\n\n* When you exercise\n* When you are sick\n* When you will be eating more or less food\n* When you are traveling\n* Before and after surgery\n\nIf you are taking insulin, contact your provider if:\n\n* You think you may need to change your insulin routine\n* You have any problems taking insulin\n* Your blood sugar is too high or too low and you don't understand why\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes - Insulin Therapy**\n\nInsulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to help the body use and store glucose (sugar).

    "content": "**Diabetes - Keeping Active**\n\nIf you have diabetes, you may think that only vigorous exercise is helpful. But this is not true. Increasing your daily activity by any amount can help improve your health. And there are a lot of ways to add more activity to your day.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThere are many benefits to being active. Staying active can:\n\n* Help control your blood sugar\n* Help control your weight\n* Keep your heart, lungs, and blood vessels healthy\n\nWhile the focus of activity is often weight loss, you can benefit and become healthier from activity even without losing weight.\n\n**Staying Active at Home**\n\nOne of the best things you can do is get up and start moving. Any activity is better than no activity.\n\n* Clean the house.\n* Walk around when you are on the phone.\n* Take frequent, short breaks at least every 30 minutes to get up and walk around when using the computer.\n* Get outside of your house and do chores, such as gardening, raking leaves, or washing the car.\n* Play outside with your kids or grandchildren.\n* Take the dog for a walk.\n\n**Staying Active Outside the Home**\n\nFor many people with diabetes, an activity program outside the home is a great option.\n\n* Talk to your health care provider about your plans and discuss what activities are right for you.\n* Visit the gym or a fitness facility and have an instructor show you how to use the equipment. Pick a gym that has an atmosphere you enjoy and gives you a number of options in terms of activities and locations.\n* When the weather is cold or wet, stay active by walking around in places like a mall.\n* Make sure you are using the right shoes and equipment.\n* Start slowly. A common mistake is to try and do too much too quickly. This can result in muscle and joint injury.\n* Involve friends or family. Activity in a group or with partners is usually more fun and motivating.\n\n**Health Risks**\n\nThere are some health risks to beginning new activity programs. Always check with your provider before getting started.\n\n* People with diabetes are at increased risk of having heart problems. They don't always sense the warning signs of a heart attack. Ask your provider if you need to be screened for heart disease, particularly if you:\n\t+ Also have high blood pressure\n\t+ Also have high cholesterol\n\t+ Smoke\n\t+ Have a history of heart disease in your family\n* People with diabetes who are overweight or obese are at higher risk of having arthritis or other joint problems. Talk to your provider if you have had joint pain with activity in the past.\n* Some people who are obese may develop skin rashes when they start new exercises. These can often be prevented by choosing the right clothing. If you develop a skin infection or rash, often in skin folds, talk to your provider and make sure it is treated before you continue being active.\n* People with diabetes and nerve damage in their feet need to be extra careful when starting new activities. Check your feet daily for redness, blisters, or calluses that are starting to form. Always wear socks. Check your socks and shoes for rough spots, which can cause blisters or ulcers. Make sure your toenails are trimmed. Let your provider know right away if you have warmth, swelling, or redness across the top of your foot or your ankle.\n* Some types of vigorous exercise (mostly heavier weight lifting) can damage your eyes if you already have diabetic eye disease. Be sure to get an eye exam before starting a new exercise program.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nPhysical activity - diabetes; Exercise - diabetes\n\n**References**\n\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 5.

Staying active can:\n\n* Help control your blood sugar\n* Help control your weight\n* Keep your heart, lungs, and blood vessels healthy\n\nWhile the focus of activity is often weight loss, you can benefit and become healthier from activity even without losing weight.\n\n**Staying Active at Home**\n\nOne of the best things you can do is get up and start moving. Any activity is better than no activity.\n\n* Clean the house\n* Walk around when you are on the phone\n* Take frequent, short breaks at least every 30 minutes to get up and walk around when using the computer\n* Get outside of your house and do chores, such as:\n\t+ Gardening\n\t+ Raking leaves\n\t+ Washing the car\n\t+ Play outside with your kids or grandchildren\n\t+ Take the dog for a walk\n\n**Staying Active Outside the Home**\n\nFor many people with diabetes, an activity program outside the home is a great option.\n\n* Talk to your health care provider about your plans and discuss what activities are right for you.\n* Visit the gym or a fitness facility and have an instructor show you how to use the equipment. Pick a gym that has an atmosphere you enjoy and gives you a number of options in terms of activities and locations.\n* When the weather is cold or wet, stay active by walking around in places like a mall.\n* Make sure you are using the right shoes and equipment.\n* Start slowly. A common mistake is to try and do too much too quickly. This can result in muscle and joint injury.\n* Involve friends or family. Activity in a group or with partners is usually more fun and motivating.\n\n**Staying Active at Work**\n\nWhen you run errands:\n\n* Walk as much as you can\n* If you do drive, park your car in the farthest part of the parking lot\n* Do not use drive-up windows. Get out of your car and walk inside the restaurant or retailer\n\nAt work:\n\n* Walk over to your co-workers instead of calling, texting, or sending them emails\n* Take the stairs instead of the elevator -- start with 1 floor up or 2 floors down and try to increase over time\n* Stand up and move around while making phone calls\n* Stretch or walk around instead of taking a coffee break or snacking\n* During lunch, walk to the bank or post office, or do other errands that allow you to move around\n\nAt the end of your commute, get off the train or bus one stop earlier and walk the rest of the way to work or home.\n\n**Health Risks**\n\nThere are some health risks to beginning new activity programs. Always check with your provider before getting started.\n\n* People with diabetes are at increased risk of having heart problems.\n* People with diabetes who are overweight or obese are at higher risk of having arthritis or other joint problems.\n* Some people who are obese may develop skin rashes when they start new exercises.\n* People with diabetes and nerve damage in their feet need to be extra careful when starting new activities.\n\n**References**\n\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 5.

Make sure your toenails are trimmed. Let your provider know right away if you have warmth, swelling, or redness across the top of your foot or your ankle.\n*   Some types of vigorous exercise (mostly heavier weight lifting) can damage your eyes if you already have diabetic eye disease. Be sure to get an eye exam before starting a new exercise program.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes - Keeping Active**\n\nIf you have diabetes, it's essential to be mindful of your health when starting a new exercise program. Here are some crucial considerations:\n\n*   **Foot Care**: People with diabetes who have nerve damage in their feet need to be extra careful when starting new activities. Check your feet daily for redness, blisters, or calluses that are starting to form. Always wear socks and check your socks and shoes for rough spots, which can cause blisters or ulcers.\n*   **Eye Care**: Some types of vigorous exercise (mostly heavier weight lifting) can damage your eyes if you already have diabetic eye disease. Be sure to get an eye exam before starting a new exercise program.\n*   **Heart Health**: People with diabetes are at increased risk of having heart problems. They don't always sense the warning signs of a heart attack. Ask your provider if you need to be screened for heart disease, particularly if you:\n    *   Have a family history of heart disease\n    *   Are overweight or obese\n    *   Have high blood pressure or high cholesterol\n*   **Joint Health**: People with diabetes who are overweight or obese are at higher risk of having arthritis or other joint problems.

    "content": "**Diabetes - Preventing Heart Attack and Stroke**\n\nPeople with diabetes have a higher chance of having heart attacks and strokes than those without diabetes. Smoking and having high blood pressure and high cholesterol increase these risks even more. Controlling blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels are very important for preventing heart attacks and strokes as is stopping smoking.\n\n**See Your Health Care Provider**\n\nSee your health care provider who treats your diabetes as often as instructed. During these visits, providers will check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure. You may also be instructed to take medicines.\n\n**Lower Your Risks**\n\nYou can lower your chance of having a heart attack or a stroke by being active or exercising every day. For instance, a daily 30-minute walk can help lower your risks.\n\n* Follow your meal plan and watch how much you eat. This can help you lose weight if you are overweight or obese.\n* Do not smoke cigarettes. Talk with your provider if you need help quitting. Also avoid exposure to cigarette smoke.\n* Take your medicines the way your providers recommend.\n* Don't miss provider appointments.\n\n**Blood Sugar**\n\nGood control of blood sugar can lower your risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\n**Review Your Diabetes Medicines**\n\nReview your diabetes medicines with your provider. Some diabetes medicines have a better effect than others in reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes. This benefit is stronger if you have already been diagnosed with cardiovascular problems.\n\n**Cholesterol**\n\nWhen you have extra cholesterol in your blood, it can build up inside the walls of your heart's arteries (blood vessels). This buildup is called plaque. It can narrow your arteries and reduces or stops blood flow. The plaque may become unstable and suddenly rupture and cause a blood clot. This is what causes a heart attack, stroke, or other serious heart disease.\n\n* Most people with diabetes are prescribed a medicine to reduce their LDL cholesterol levels.\n* Medicines called statins are most often used.\n* You should learn how to take your statin medicine and how to watch for side effects.\n* Your provider will tell you if there is a target LDL level you need to aim for.\n\n**Blood Pressure**\n\nHave your blood pressure checked often. Your provider should check your blood pressure at every visit. For almost all people with diabetes, a good blood pressure goal is a systolic (top number) blood pressure below 130 mm Hg, and a diastolic blood pressure (bottom number) less than 80 mm Hg. Ask your provider what blood pressure target is best for you.\n\n* Exercising, eating low-salt foods, and losing weight (if you are overweight or obese) can lower your blood pressure.\n* If your blood pressure is too high, your provider will prescribe medicines to lower it. Controlling blood pressure is as important as controlling blood sugar for preventing heart attack and stroke.\n\n**Before You Exercise**\n\nGetting exercise will help you control your diabetes and make your heart stronger. Always talk with your provider before you start a new exercise program or before you increase the amount of exercise you are doing. Some people with diabetes may have heart problems and not know it because they do not have symptoms. Doing moderate intensity exercise for at least 2.5 hours every week can help protect against heart disease and stroke.\n\n**Taking Aspirin May Help**\n\nTaking aspirin every day may lower your chance of having a heart attack. The recommended dose is 81 milligrams (mg) a day. Do not take aspirin in this way without talking to your provider first. Ask your provider about taking an aspirin every day if:\n\n* You are a man over 50 or a woman over 60\n* You have had heart problems\n* People in your family have had heart problems\n* You have high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels\n* You are a smoker\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes - Preventing Heart Attack and Stroke**\n\nPeople with diabetes have a higher chance of having heart attacks and strokes than those without diabetes.

Your healthcare provider may recommend that you check your blood sugar at home using a special device called a glucometer. They may also ask you to keep a record of your blood sugar readings to monitor any changes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diabetes - When You Are Sick**\n\nIf you have diabetes and become sick, it's crucial to inform your healthcare provider as soon as possible. Sickness can cause your blood sugar levels to rise or fall rapidly, which can lead to serious complications if not managed properly.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Low Blood Sugar - Self-Care**\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycemia) is a common complication of diabetes. If you experience symptoms such as shakiness, dizziness, or confusion, it's essential to consume 15-20 grams of fast-acting carbohydrates, like glucose tablets or juice, immediately. Then, wait for 30 minutes before checking your blood sugar levels again.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Managing Your Blood Sugar**\n\nTo manage your blood sugar effectively, it's crucial to:\n\n*   Monitor your blood sugar levels regularly\n*   Take your medications as prescribed by your healthcare provider\n*   Make healthy food choices and maintain a balanced diet\n*   Engage in regular physical activity\n*   Get enough sleep each night\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Type 2 Diabetes - What to Ask Your Doctor**\n\nWhen discussing your treatment plan with your healthcare provider, consider asking the following questions:\n\n*   What are my blood sugar goals, and how can I achieve them?\n*   How often should I check my blood sugar levels, and what are the normal ranges for my condition?\n*   Are there any lifestyle changes or dietary modifications that can help me manage my diabetes more effectively?",

This can lead to numbness, reduced feeling, and increased susceptibility to injuries that may not heal properly. Even small sores or blisters can become serious problems if left untreated.\n\n**Self-Care**\n\nFollow your healthcare provider's instructions on how to take care of your feet. Here are some essential reminders:\n\n*   Check your feet every day by inspecting the tops, sides, soles, heels, and between your toes for:\n    *   Dry and cracked skin\n    *   Blisters or sores\n    *   Bruises or cuts\n    *   Redness, warmth, or tenderness (often absent due to nerve damage)\n    *   Firm or hard spots\n\nIf you have poor vision, ask someone else to check your feet for you.\n\n*   Wash your feet daily with lukewarm water and mild soap. Avoid using strong soaps that can damage the skin.\n*   Gently dry your feet, paying extra attention to the areas between your toes.\n*   Apply lotion, petroleum jelly, lanolin, or oil on dry skin. However, only apply these products between your toes if instructed to do so by your healthcare provider.\n\n**Foot Care Tips**\n\n*   Check the temperature of the water with your hand or elbow before washing your feet.\n*   Trim your toenails straight across and avoid cutting them too short, as this can lead to ingrown toenails.\n*   Soak your feet in lukewarm water to soften your toenails before trimming.\n*   Wear clean, dry socks every day to prevent pressure points and infections.\n*   Avoid walking barefoot, especially on hot surfaces like pavement or sandy beaches.\n\n**When to Seek Medical Attention**\n\nContact your healthcare provider immediately if you notice any of the following changes in your feet:\n\n*   Redness\n*   Increased warmth\n*   Swelling\n*   Sores or cracks\n*   Tingling or burning sensation\n*   Pain\n\nDon't try to treat these issues yourself.

Only apply lotion between your toes if instructed by your provider.\n\n**Trimming Toenails**\n\nAsk your provider to show you how to trim your toenails:\n\n*   Soak your feet in lukewarm water to soften the nails before trimming.\n*   Cut the nails straight across. Curved nails are more likely to become ingrown.\n*   Ensure the edge of each nail doesn't press into the skin of the next toe.\n\n**Treating Corns and Calluses**\n\nIf your foot doctor has given you permission to treat corns or calluses on your own:\n\n*   Gently use a pumice stone to remove corns and calluses after a shower or bath, when your skin is soft.\n*   Avoid using medicated pads or trying to shave or cut corns and calluses away at home.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n*   Stop smoking, as it decreases blood flow to your feet. Talk to your provider or nurse if you need help quitting.\n*   Wear shoes that fit well and are comfortable. Check the inside of your shoes for stones, nails, or rough areas that may hurt your feet.\n*   Remove your shoes and socks during visits to your provider so they can check your feet.\n\nBy following these steps and tips, you can help prevent diabetic foot ulcers and other complications related to diabetes.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes - Taking Care of Your Feet**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Self-Care**\n\nFollow your health care provider's instructions on how to take care of your feet.

Strong soaps may damage the skin.\n* Check the temperature of the water with your hand or elbow first.\n* Gently dry your feet, especially between the toes.\n* Use lotion, petroleum jelly, lanolin, or oil on dry skin. Do not put lotion, oil, or cream between your toes unless instructed to do so by your provider.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Shoes and Socks**\n\nWear shoes at all times to protect your feet from injury. Before you put them on, always check the inside of your shoes for stones, nails, or rough areas that may hurt your feet.\n\n* Wear shoes that are comfortable and fit well when you buy them. Never buy shoes that are tight, not even if you think they will stretch as you wear them. You may not feel pressure from shoes that do not fit well. Blisters and sores can develop when your foot presses against your shoe.\n* Ask your provider if you need special shoes that can give your feet more room. When you get new shoes, break them in slowly. Wear them 1 or 2 hours a day for the first 1 or 2 weeks.\n* Change your broken-in shoes after 5 hours during the day to change the pressure points on your feet. Do not wear flip-flop sandals or stockings with seams. Both can cause pressure points.\n* To protect your feet, wear clean, dry socks or non-binding panty hose every day. Holes in socks or stockings can put damaging pressure on your toes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n* If you smoke, stop. Smoking decreases blood flow to your feet. Talk to your provider or nurse if you need help quitting.\n* Do not use a heating pad or hot water bottle on your feet. Don't walk barefoot, particularly on hot pavement, hot tiles, or hot, sandy beaches. This can cause severe burns in people with diabetes because their skin does not respond normally to the heat.\n* Remove your shoes and socks during visits to your provider so that they can check your feet.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Special Cases**\n\n* Do not try to cut very thick toenails by yourself. Your foot doctor (podiatrist) can trim your toenails if you are unable to. If your toenails are thick and discolored (possibly due to a fungal infection) do not trim the nails yourself. If your vision is poor or you have decreased sensation in your feet, you should see a podiatrist to trim your toenails to prevent possible injury.\n* Most people with diabetes should have corns or calluses treated by a foot doctor. If your foot doctor has given you permission to treat corns or calluses on your own:\n\t+ Gently use a pumice stone to remove corns and calluses after a shower or bath, when your skin is soft.\n\t+ Don't use medicated pads or try to shave or cut corns and calluses away at home.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes - Taking Care of Your Feet**\n\nAs a person with diabetes, you're at risk for foot problems. To protect your feet, follow these steps:\n\n*   Wear clean, dry socks or non-binding panty hose every day.\n*   Avoid holes in socks or stockings, which can cause damaging pressure on your toes.\n*   Consider special socks with extra padding or moisture-wicking properties to keep your feet drier.\n*   In cold weather, wear warm socks and limit your time outdoors.\n\n**Shoe Care**\n\n*   Wear shoes at all times to protect your feet from injury.\n*   Before putting on shoes, check the inside for stones, nails, or rough areas that may hurt your feet.\n*   Buy comfortable, well-fitting shoes. Avoid tight shoes, even if you think they'll stretch as you wear them.\n*   Ask your provider if you need special shoes that can give your feet more room.\n*   Break in new shoes slowly by wearing them 1 or 2 hours a day for the first 1 or 2 weeks.\n*   Change your broken-in shoes after 5 hours during the day to change the pressure points on your feet.\n\n**Foot Care Tips**\n\n*   Avoid flip-flop sandals or stockings with seams, which can cause pressure points.\n*   Wear clean, dry socks to bed if your feet are cold.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider right away about any foot problems you have. Don't try to treat these problems yourself. Contact your provider if you have any of the following changes to any part of your foot:\n\n*   Redness\n*   Increased warmth\n*   Swelling\n*   Sores or cracks\n*   Tingling or burning feeling\n*   Pain\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes - Taking Care of Your Feet**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diabetes Tests and Checkups**\n\nIf you have diabetes, it's essential to keep track of your blood sugar levels. You should get a hemoglobin A1c test at least twice a year to check your average blood sugar level over the past 2-3 months. Additionally, you may need to take other tests, such as urine tests or oral glucose tolerance tests, depending on your specific situation.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diabetes - When You Are Sick**\n\nIf you have diabetes and become sick or injured, it's crucial to monitor your blood sugar levels closely. Illness can cause your blood sugar level to rise, so be sure to check your levels frequently and adjust your treatment plan as needed. Your healthcare provider may also recommend that you take extra insulin or oral medications to help manage your blood sugar.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Low Blood Sugar - Self-Care**\n\nIf you experience low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), follow these steps:\n\n*   Take a quick-acting source of sugar, such as glucose tablets or candy\n*   Eat a snack that contains protein and complex carbohydrates to help stabilize your blood sugar level\n*   If your symptoms persist or worsen, seek medical attention\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Managing Your Blood Sugar**\n\nTo manage your blood sugar levels effectively, make sure to:\n\n*   Monitor your blood sugar levels regularly\n*   Take your medications as prescribed by your healthcare provider\n*   Eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources\n*   Engage in regular physical activity, such as walking or other low-impact exercises\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Type 2 Diabetes - What to Ask Your Doctor**\n\nWhen discussing your treatment plan with your healthcare provider, be sure to ask about:\n\n*   The best ways to manage your blood sugar levels\n*   Any lifestyle changes you can make to improve your overall health\n*   The potential risks and benefits of different medications or treatments\n\n\\n\\n",

    "content": "**Diabetes - When You Are Sick**\n\nWaiting too long to get medical care when you are sick can lead to getting much sicker. When you have diabetes, a delay in getting care can be life threatening. Even a minor cold can make your diabetes harder to control. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to more serious health problems.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nWhen you are sick, insulin does not work as well in your cells and your blood sugar level can be higher. This can happen even if you are taking the normal doses of your medicines, including insulin.\n\nWhen you are sick, keep a close watch on diabetes warning signs. These are:\n\n* High blood sugar that will not come down with treatment\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Low blood sugar that will not rise after you eat\n* Confusion or changes in how you normally behave\n\nIf you have any of these warning signs and cannot treat them yourself, contact your health care provider right away. Make sure your family members also know the warning signs.\n\n**Sick-day Plan**\n\nDiscuss with your provider, before you are sick, how best to handle illnesses. Typical sick day plans are below.\n\n* Check your blood sugar more often than usual (every 2 to 4 hours). Try to keep your blood sugar at less than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L).\n* There may be times when you need to check your blood sugar every hour.\n* Write down or record all your blood sugar levels, the time of each test, and the medicines you have taken.\n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, check your urine ketones every time you urinate.\n\n**Eating When You Are Sick**\n\nWhen you have an upset stomach, try to eat small meals. Try carbohydrates, such as:\n\n* Bagels or bread\n* Cooked cereal\n* Mashed potatoes\n* Noodle or rice soup\n* Saltines\n* Fruit-flavored gelatin\n* Graham crackers\n\nMany foods have the right amount of carbohydrates (about 15 grams) for your sick-day diet. Remember, on sick days it is OK to eat some foods you might not normally eat, if you cannot eat your regular foods. Always check the label of foods to be sure you know their carbohydrate content.\n\n**Drinking Lots of Fluids**\n\nDrink plenty of sugar-free fluids to keep your body from getting dried out (dehydrated). Drink at least twelve 8-ounce (oz) cups (3 liters) of fluid a day.\n\nFeeling sick often makes you not want to eat or drink, which, surprisingly, can lead to a higher blood sugar.\n\nFluids you can drink if you are dehydrated include:\n\n* Water\n* Club soda\n* Diet soda (caffeine-free)\n* Tomato juice\n* Chicken broth\n\nIf your blood sugar is less than 100 mg/dL (5.5 mmol/L) or falling quickly, it is OK to drink fluids that have sugar in them. Try to check their effect on your blood sugar in the same way you check how other foods affect your blood sugar.\n\nFluids you can drink if your blood sugar is low include:\n\n* Apple juice\n* Orange juice\n* Grapefruit juice\n* Sports drink\n* Tea with honey\n* Lemon-lime drinks\n* Ginger ale\n\nIf you throw up, do not drink or eat anything for 1 hour. Rest, but do not lie flat. After 1 hour, take sips of soda, such as ginger ale, every 10 minutes. If vomiting persists, contact or see your provider.\n\n**Diabetes Medicines**\n\nMost of the time, you should take all of your medicines as you usually do. Do not skip or double up on any medicine unless your provider tells you to.\n\nIf you cannot eat your normal amount of carbohydrates, use your sick day plan or contact your provider. You may need to make a change in your insulin dose or in the dose of your diabetes pills or other injections. You may also need to do this if your illness is making your blood sugar higher than normal.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nBeing sick increases the risk of more serious emergencies seen with diabetes.\n\nContact your provider if you have:\n\n* Blood sugar higher than 240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) for more than 1 day\n* Moderate-to-large ketones with your urine tests\n* Vomiting or diarrhea for more than 4 hours\n* Any severe pain or chest pain\n* A fever of 100°F (37.7°C) or higher\n* Trouble moving your arms or legs\n* Vision, speech, or balance problems\n* Confusion or new memory problems\n\nIf your provider does not contact you back right away, you may need to go to the emergency room. This is particularly important if you are vomiting or have diarrhea for more than 4 hours.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nSick-day management - diabetes; Diabetes - sick day management; Insulin resistance - sick day management; Ketoacidosis - sick day management; Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome - sick day management\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes - When You Are Sick**\n\nWaiting too long to get medical care when you are sick can lead to getting much sicker.

If you use insulin, you may even need extra insulin injections or higher doses.\n\nDo not do vigorous exercise when you are sick.\n\nIf you take insulin, you should also have a glucagon emergency treatment kit prescribed by your provider. Always have this kit available.\n\n**Drink Lots of Fluids**\n\nDrink plenty of sugar-free fluids to keep your body from getting dried out (dehydrated).

Remember, on sick days it is OK to eat some foods you might not normally eat, if you cannot eat your regular foods. Always check the label of foods to be sure you know their carbohydrate content. Some foods to try are:\n\n*   One half cup (120 milliliters, mL) apple juice\n*   One half cup (120 mL) regular soft drink (non-diet, caffeine free)\n*   One fruit-flavored frozen pop (1 stick)\n*   Five small hard candies\n*   One slice of dry toast\n*   One half cup (120 mL) cooked cereal\n*   Six saltine crackers\n*   One half cup (120 mL) frozen yogurt\n*   One cup (240 mL) sports drink\n*   One half cup (120 mL) regular ice cream (if you are not throwing up)\n*   One quarter cup (60 mL) sherbet\n*   One quarter cup (60 mL) regular pudding (if you are not throwing up)\n*   One half cup (120 mL) regular fruit-flavored gelatin\n*   One cup (240 mL) yogurt (not frozen), sugar-free or plain\n*   Milkshake made with one half cup (120 mL) low-fat milk and one quarter cup (60 mL) ice cream mixed in a blender (if you are not throwing up)\n\nWhen you are sick, you should try to eat the same amount of carbohydrates that you normally do. If possible, follow your regular diet. If you are having a hard time swallowing, eat soft foods.\n\nIf you have already taken your insulin and are sick to your stomach, drink enough liquids with the same amount of carbohydrates that you would normally eat. If you cannot keep food or liquids down, go to the emergency room for treatment. You will receive intravenous (IV) fluids.\n\n**Diabetes Medicines**\n\nMost of the time, you should take all of your medicines as you usually do. Do not skip or double up on any medicine unless your provider tells you to.\n\nIf you cannot eat your normal amount of carbohydrates, use your sick day plan or contact your provider.

But neglecting your condition can lead to serious complications. In this section, we'll cover how to navigate eating and medication when you're sick.\n\n**Eating When You're Sick**\n\nWhen you have an upset stomach, try to eat small meals. Focus on carbohydrates like:\n\n* Bagels or bread\n* Cooked cereal\n* Mashed potatoes\n* Noodle or rice soup\n* Saltines\n* Fruit-flavored gelatin\n* Graham crackers\n\nMany foods contain the right amount of carbohydrates (about 15 grams) for your sick-day diet. If you can't eat your regular foods, it's okay to try new ones. Always check the label to ensure you know the carbohydrate content.\n\nSome specific foods to consider are:\n\n* One half cup (120 milliliters) apple juice\n* One half cup (120 mL) regular soft drink (non-diet, caffeine-free)\n* One fruit-flavored frozen pop (1 stick)\n* Five small hard candies\n* One slice of dry toast\n* One half cup (120 mL) cooked cereal\n* Six saltine crackers\n* One half cup (120 mL) frozen yogurt\n* One cup (240 mL) sports drink\n* One half cup (120 mL) regular ice cream (if you're not throwing up)\n* One quarter cup (60 mL) sherbet\n* One quarter cup (60 mL) regular pudding (if you're not throwing up)\n* One half cup (120 mL) regular fruit-flavored gelatin\n* One cup (240 mL) yogurt (not frozen), sugar-free or plain\n* Milkshake made with one half cup (120 mL) low-fat milk and one quarter cup (60 mL) ice cream (if you're not throwing up)\n\nAim to eat the same amount of carbohydrates as you normally would. If possible, stick to your regular diet. If swallowing is a challenge, opt for soft foods.\n\n**Fluids When You're Sick**\n\nIf your blood sugar is low (<100 mg/dL or 5.5 mmol/L), it's okay to drink fluids with sugar in them. Check their effect on your blood sugar just like you would with other foods.\n\nFor dehydration:\n\n* Drink at least twelve 8-ounce (oz) cups (3 liters) of fluid a day.\n* Focus on sugar-free fluids to avoid drying out.\n\nIf you throw up, don't drink or eat anything for 1 hour. Rest, but avoid lying flat. After 1 hour, take sips of soda like ginger ale every 10 minutes. If vomiting persists, contact your provider.\n\n**Diabetes Medicines**\n\nMost of the time, take all your medicines as usual. Don't skip or double up on any medicine unless your provider tells you to.\n\nIf you can't eat your normal amount of carbohydrates, use your sick day plan or consult your provider. You may need to adjust your insulin dose or diabetes pill dosage. This might also be necessary if your illness is causing higher-than-normal blood sugar levels.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nBeing sick increases the risk of serious emergencies related to diabetes. Contact your provider if you experience:\n\n* Blood sugar >240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) for more than 1 day\n* Moderate-to-large ketones with urine tests\n* Vomiting or diarrhea >4 hours\n* Severe pain or chest pain\n* Fever ≥100°F (37.7°C)\n* Trouble moving your arms or legs\n* Vision, speech, or balance problems\n* Confusion or new memory issues\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes - When You Are Sick**\n\nBeing sick increases the risk of more serious emergencies seen with diabetes.

Diabetes can damage the nerves in your feet, making it difficult to feel pain or discomfort. This increases the risk of foot injuries and infections going unnoticed. To prevent complications:\n\n*   Check your feet daily for cuts, blisters, or other injuries\n*   Wash your feet gently with soap and water\n*   Dry your feet thoroughly, especially between the toes\n*   Trim toenails straight across to avoid ingrown toenails\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diabetes Tests and Checkups**\n\nRegular tests and checkups are crucial for managing diabetes. Your healthcare provider may recommend:\n\n*   Fasting blood sugar test: measures glucose levels in the blood after an overnight fast\n*   Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): measures how your body responds to a sugary drink\n*   Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test: measures average blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months\n*   Annual eye exam to detect potential vision problems\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Low Blood Sugar - Self-Care**\n\nIf you experience low blood sugar, also known as hypoglycemia, follow these steps:\n\n*   Consume a quick source of sugar or glucose, such as candy, fruit juice, or glucose tablets\n*   Eat a snack containing protein and complex carbohydrates to stabilize your blood sugar levels\n*   Monitor your blood sugar levels regularly to avoid future episodes\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Managing Your Blood Sugar**\n\nTo manage your blood sugar effectively:\n\n*   Work with your healthcare provider to develop a personalized treatment plan\n*   Adhere to your medication regimen, including insulin injections if necessary\n*   Make healthy lifestyle choices, such as maintaining a balanced diet and engaging in regular physical activity\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Type 2 Diabetes - What to Ask Your Doctor**\n\nWhen discussing your type 2 diabetes with your healthcare provider:\n\n*   Inquire about the best course of treatment for your specific condition\n*   Discuss potential lifestyle changes to improve blood sugar control\n*   Explore options for managing related health issues, such as high blood pressure or kidney disease",

    "content": "**Diabetes Complications**\n\nIf you have diabetes, your blood glucose levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy.\n\nWith type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood.\n\n**Health Problems Caused by Diabetes**\n\nOver time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause complications, including:\n\n* Eye disease, due to changes in fluid levels, swelling in the tissues, and damage to the blood vessels in the eyes.\n* Foot problems, caused by damage to the nerves and reduced blood flow to your feet.\n* Gum disease and other dental problems, because a high amount of glucose in your saliva helps harmful bacteria grow in your mouth. The bacteria combine with food to form a soft, sticky film called plaque. Plaque also comes from eating foods that contain sugars or starches. Some types of plaque cause gum disease and bad breath. Other types cause tooth decay and cavities.\n* Heart disease and stroke, caused by damage to your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels.\n* Kidney disease, due to damage to the blood vessels in your kidneys. Many people with diabetes develop high blood pressure. That can also damage your kidneys.\n* Nerve problems (diabetic neuropathy), caused by damage to the nerves and the small blood vessels that nourish your nerves with oxygen and nutrients.\n* Sexual and bladder problems, caused by damage to the nerves and reduced blood flow in the genitals and bladder.\n* Skin conditions, some of which are caused by changes in the small blood vessels and reduced circulation. People with diabetes are also more likely to have infections, including skin infections.\n\n**Other Problems That Can Affect People With Diabetes**\n\nIf you have diabetes, you need to watch out for blood glucose levels that are too high (hyperglycemia) or too low for you (hypoglycemia). These can happen quickly and can become dangerous. Some of the causes include having another illness or infection and certain medicines. They can also happen if you don't get the right amount of diabetes medicines. To try to prevent these problems, make sure to take your diabetes medicines correctly, follow your diabetic diet, and check your blood glucose regularly.\n\n**Preventing Diabetes Complications**\n\nTo avoid complications, it's essential to manage your blood sugar levels effectively. This includes:\n\n* Taking your diabetes medicines correctly\n* Following a healthy diet\n* Exercising regularly\n* Monitoring your blood glucose levels regularly\n\nBy taking these steps, you can reduce your risk of developing complications related to diabetes.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes Complications**\n\nWithout enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood.\n\n**What health problems can diabetes cause?**\n\nOver time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause complications, including:\n\n* Eye disease, due to changes in fluid levels, swelling in the tissues, and damage to the blood vessels in the eyes.\n* Foot problems, caused by damage to the nerves and reduced blood flow to your feet.\n* Gum disease and other dental problems, because a high amount of glucose in your saliva helps harmful bacteria grow in your mouth.

    "content": "**Diabetes Insipidus**\n\nAlso called: DI\n\n**What is Diabetes Insipidus?**\n\nDiabetes insipidus (DI) causes frequent urination. You become extremely thirsty, so you drink. Then you urinate. This cycle can keep you from sleeping or even make you wet the bed. Your body produces lots of urine that is almost all water.\n\n**How is Diabetes Insipidus Different from Diabetes Mellitus?**\n\nDI is different from diabetes mellitus (DM), which involves insulin problems and high blood sugar. The symptoms can be similar. However, DI is related to how your kidneys handle fluids. It's much less common than DM. Urine and blood tests can show which one you have.\n\n**What Causes Diabetes Insipidus?**\n\nUsually, DI is caused by a problem with your pituitary gland or your kidneys. Treatment depends on the cause of the problem. Medicines can often help.\n\n**NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases**\n\n*   **Start Here**\n    *   Diabetes Insipidus (Endocrine Society)\n    *   Diabetes Insipidus  (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases)\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\n*   Osmolality Tests  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Also in Spanish\n*   Sodium Blood Test  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Also in Spanish\n\n**Genetics**\n\n*   Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Wolfram syndrome: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov: Diabetes Insipidus  (National Institutes of Health)\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\n*   References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Article: Development and validation of a predictive machine learning model for postoperative... \n*   Article: Urinary oxytocin secretion after pituitary surgery, early arginine vasopressin deficiency and... \n*   Article: Nomogram for predicting diabetes insipidus following endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery in pituitary...\n\n**Find an Expert**\n\n*   National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n\n**Patient Handouts**\n\n*   Central diabetes insipidus (Medical Encyclopedia)\n*   Also in Spanish\n*   Diabetes insipidus (Medical Encyclopedia)\n*   Also in Spanish\n*   Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (Medical Encyclopedia)\n*   Also in Spanish\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes Insipidus**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Diabetes Insipidus?**\n\nDiabetes insipidus (DI) is a rare disorder that affects the regulation of fluids in the body. It is characterized by an inability to regulate thirst and urination, leading to excessive production of urine.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of Diabetes Insipidus**\n\nThere are two main types of diabetes insipidus:\n\n*   **Central Diabetes Insipidus**: This type is caused by a deficiency in antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which is produced by the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary gland. Central DI can be caused by head trauma, infections, or tumors that damage the hypothalamus or pituitary gland.\n*   **Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus**: This type is caused by a problem with the kidneys' ability to respond to ADH. The kidneys are unable to reabsorb water, leading to an excessive loss of urine.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Diabetes Insipidus**\n\nThe symptoms of diabetes insipidus include:\n\n*   **Excessive Thirst**: A constant feeling of thirst that cannot be quenched by drinking fluids.\n*   **Polyuria**: The production of large amounts of urine, often exceeding 4 liters per day.\n*   **Weight Loss**: Despite excessive fluid intake, individuals with DI may experience weight loss due to the excessive loss of water and electrolytes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis of Diabetes Insipidus**\n\nThe diagnosis of diabetes insipidus is typically made through a combination of:\n\n*   **Medical History**: A thorough review of the individual's medical history to identify any underlying conditions that may be contributing to the development of DI.\n*   **Physical Examination**: A physical examination to assess for any signs of dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.\n*   **Laboratory Tests**: Laboratory tests, such as a urine concentration test and a 24-hour urine volume test, can help diagnose DI by measuring the levels of ADH in the blood and the concentration of urine.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment of Diabetes Insipidus**\n\nThe treatment of diabetes insipidus depends on the underlying cause of the condition. In some cases, treatment may involve:\n\n*   **Hormone Replacement Therapy**: For individuals with central DI, hormone replacement therapy may be necessary to replace deficient ADH.\n*   **Fluid and Electrolyte Management**: Close monitoring and management of fluid and electrolyte balance are crucial in preventing dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**National Institutes of Health**\n\nThe primary NIH organization for research on Diabetes Insipidus is the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.",

Glucose comes from the foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.\n\n**Treatments for Diabetes**\n\nTreatments for diabetes can depend on the type. Common treatments include a diabetic meal plan, regular physical activity, and medicines. Some less common treatments are weight loss surgery for either type and an artificial pancreas or pancreatic islet transplantation for some people with type 1 diabetes.\n\n**Who Needs Diabetes Medicines?**\n\nPeople with type 1 diabetes need to take a diabetes medicine called insulin to control their blood sugar. Some people with type 2 diabetes can control their blood sugar with healthy food choices and physical activity. But for others, a diabetic meal plan and physical activity are not enough. They need to take diabetes medicines.\n\n**Types of Medicines for Type 1 Diabetes**\n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, you must take insulin because your body no longer makes it. There are different types of insulin that start to work at different speeds, and the effects of each last a different length of time. Your health care provider will measure your blood glucose to decide on the type of insulin. You may need to use more than one type.\n\nYou can take insulin several different ways:\n\n* With a needle and syringe\n* With an insulin pen\n* With an insulin pump\n* With inhalers, injection ports, or jet injectors\n\n**Types of Medicines for Type 2 Diabetes**\n\nThere are several different medicines for type 2 diabetes. Each works in a different way. Many of them are pills. There are also medicines that you inject under your skin, such as insulin.\n\nOver time, you may need more than one diabetes medicine to manage your blood sugar. You might add another diabetes medicine or switch to a combination medicine. A combination medicine contains more than one type of diabetes medicine in the same pill. Some people with type 2 diabetes take both pills and injections.\n\n**What Else Should I Know About Taking Medicines for Diabetes?**\n\nEven if you take medicines for diabetes, you still need to eat a healthy diet, stop smoking, take your other medicines, and get regular physical activity. These will help you manage your diabetes.\n\nIt is important to make sure that you understand your diabetes treatment plan. Talk to your provider about:\n\n* What your target blood sugar level is\n* What to do if your blood sugar gets too low or too high\n* Whether your diabetes medicines will affect other medicines you take\n* If you will have any side effects from the diabetes medicines\n\nYou should not change or stop your diabetes medicines on your own.

    "content": "**Diabetes Tests**\n\n**What are Diabetes Tests?**\n\nDiabetes tests measure glucose levels in your blood to monitor your blood glucose level or see if you have or are at risk for diabetes.\n\n**What is Diabetes?**\n\nDiabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a disease that affects how your body uses glucose (blood sugar). Glucose is your body's main source of energy. A hormone called insulin helps move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells.\n\nIf you have diabetes, your body can't make insulin or can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. This can cause glucose levels to get too high, which can lead to serious health conditions.\n\n**What are Diabetes Tests Used For?**\n\nDiabetes tests are used to screen, monitor, and/or diagnose the following:\n\n* Type 1 diabetes\n* Type 2 diabetes\n* Gestational diabetes\n* Prediabetes\n\n**Why Do I Need a Diabetes Test?**\n\nYou may need testing to monitor your blood glucose level or if you have symptoms of diabetes, such as:\n\n* Increased thirst\n* Frequent urination\n* Increased hunger\n* Fatigue\n* Blurred vision\n* Unexplained weight loss\n* Sores that are slow to heal\n* Numbness or tingling in your feet\n\n**What Happens During a Diabetes Test?**\n\nThere are several ways to screen for, monitor, and diagnose diabetes. Most tests involve measuring your blood glucose levels.\n\nTo get a blood sample, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\nThe different types of glucose blood tests include:\n\n* Blood glucose test\n* Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)\n* Glucose challenge test\n* Random blood sugar\n* Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)\n\nGlucose may also be measured in your urine.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for This Test?**\n\nYou will need to fast (not eat or drink) for a blood glucose and an oral glucose tolerance test.\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a random blood sugar test, glucose challenge test, hemoglobin A1c test, or glucose in urine test.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to This Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. There may be slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\nThere is no risk to having a urine test.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nDepending on the type of test or tests you had, your results may show one of the following:\n\n* Your glucose is at a healthy level for you.\n* Prediabetes. This means you have glucose levels that are higher than what is healthy for you and may be at risk of getting diabetes.\n* Type 1 or type 2 diabetes.\n* Gestational diabetes.\n\nIf you have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, talk to your provider about how to best manage the disease. There is no cure for type 1 diabetes, but it may be controlled with regular glucose monitoring and taking insulin.\n\nIf you've been diagnosed with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, your condition may be managed or even reversed by taking diabetes medicines and making lifestyle changes. These include eating a healthy diet, losing weight, and increasing exercise.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes Tests**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Diabetes?**\n\nDiabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a disease that affects how your body uses glucose (blood sugar). Glucose is your body's main source of energy.

Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. This can cause glucose levels to get too high, which can lead to serious health conditions. These may include heart disease, nerve damage, eye problems, and kidney disease.\n\nYour blood glucose can also drop below what is healthy for you. If it drops very low, you could lose consciousness or have a seizure.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are Diabetes Tests Used For?**\n\nDiabetes tests are used to screen, monitor, and/or diagnose the following:\n\n*   Type 1 diabetes\n*   Type 2 diabetes\n*   Gestational diabetes\n*   Prediabetes\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why Do I Need a Diabetes Test?**\n\nYou may need testing to monitor your blood glucose level or if you have symptoms of diabetes, such as:\n\n*   Increased thirst\n*   Frequent urination\n*   Increased hunger\n*   Fatigue\n*   Blurred vision\n*   Unexplained weight loss\n*   Sores that are slow to heal\n*   Numbness or tingling in your feet\n\nSymptoms of type 1 diabetes usually come on quickly and can be severe. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes often develop slowly, even over years.\n\nGestational diabetes doesn't usually cause symptoms in the early stages of your pregnancy, but you will most likely be screened for the condition between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. If testing shows your glucose levels are too high, you will be tested again to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nYou may also need testing if you have certain risk factors for type 2 diabetes. You may be at higher risk for developing it if you:\n\n*   Are over 35 years old\n*   Have prediabetes\n*   Are overweight or have obesity\n*   Have a family history of diabetes\n*   Have high blood pressure or heart disease\n*   Previously had gestational diabetes\n*   Exercise less than three times a week\n*   Have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)\n*   Are an African American, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian, or an Alaska Native\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Happens During a Diabetes Test?**\n\nThere are several ways to screen for, monitor, and diagnose diabetes.

This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\nThe different types of glucose blood tests include:\n\n*   Fasting plasma glucose (FPG)\n*   Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)\n*   Random blood sugar\n*   Blood sugar\n*   Fasting blood sugar (FBS)\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes Tests**\n\nYou will need to fast (not eat or drink) for a blood glucose and an oral glucose tolerance test.\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a random blood sugar test, glucose challenge test, hemoglobin A1c test, or glucose in urine test.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**The Different Types of Glucose Blood Tests**\n\n*   **Blood glucose test**: Before the test, you will need to fast (not eat or drink) for eight hours before the test. This test is usually done in the morning and is often used as a screening test for diabetes.\n*   **Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)**: This test also requires fasting. When you arrive for your test, a blood sample will be taken. You will then drink a sugary liquid that contains glucose. About two hours later, another blood sample will be taken.\n*   **Glucose challenge test**: This test may be used to test for gestational diabetes. You will drink a sugary liquid that contains glucose. A blood sample will be taken one hour later.\n*   **Random blood sugar**: This test can be taken at any time. No fasting is required.\n*   **Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)**: This test measures the average amount of glucose attached to hemoglobin over the past three months.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Glucose in Urine Test**\n\nGlucose may also be measured in your urine. For a glucose in urine test, your provider may recommend an at-home test kit. The kit will include a test strip that you hold under your stream of urine. The test strip will change colors to show different levels of glucose.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nDepending on the type of test or tests you had, your results may show one of the following:\n\n*   **Healthy level**: Your glucose is at a healthy level for you.\n*   **Prediabetes**: This means you have glucose levels that are higher than what is healthy for you and may be at risk of getting diabetes.\n*   **Type 1 or type 2 diabetes**: Type 1 diabetes has no cure, but it can be controlled with regular glucose monitoring and taking insulin. Type 2 diabetes can be managed or even reversed by taking diabetes medicines and making lifestyle changes.\n*   **Gestational diabetes**: You may be able to lower your glucose levels by eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About Diabetes Testing?**\n\nIf you've been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, you will need to monitor your blood glucose levels daily, often several times a day. Your provider can recommend a kit you can use at home. Most kits include a lancet, a device that pricks your finger. You will use this to collect a drop of blood for testing.\n\nPeople with type 2 diabetes must also check their blood sugar regularly. If you have type 2 diabetes, talk to your provider about how often it should be checked.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes Tests**\n\nIf you have diabetes, your provider will likely recommend that you check your blood sugar levels regularly. The frequency of testing depends on the type of diabetes you have.\n\n**Type 1 Diabetes**\n\nIf you've been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, you will need to monitor your blood glucose levels daily, often several times a day. Your provider can recommend a kit you can use at home. Most kits include a lancet, a device that pricks your finger. You will use this to collect a drop of blood for testing. There are some newer kits available that don't require pricking your finger.\n\n**Type 2 Diabetes**\n\nPeople with type 2 diabetes must also check their blood sugar regularly. If you have type 2 diabetes, talk to your provider about how often it should be checked. People with type 2 diabetes may also need to have their insulin levels checked regularly. Insulin plays a key role in keeping glucose at the right levels. An insulin in blood test is done at a provider's office.\n\n**Gestational Diabetes**\n\nIf you are pregnant and have gestational diabetes, you may also need to monitor your glucose levels in this way.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes Tests**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of Diabetes Mellitus**\n\nThere are several types of diabetes mellitus, including:\n\n*   **Type 1 Diabetes**: An autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin.\n*   **Type 2 Diabetes**: A metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels due to insulin resistance or impaired insulin secretion.\n*   **Prediabetes**: A condition in which blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not yet high enough to be classified as diabetes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diabetes Tests**\n\nThe following tests can help diagnose and monitor diabetes:\n\n*   **Blood Glucose Test**: Measures the level of glucose in the blood.\n*   **Fasting for a Blood Test**: Requires the patient to fast for a certain period before having their blood tested.\n*   **Glucose in Urine Test**: Detects the presence of glucose in the urine.\n*   **Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) Test**: Measures the average level of glucose in the blood over a period of time.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\nThe following health topics are related to diabetes:\n\n*   **Blood Glucose**\n*   **Diabetes and Pregnancy**\n*   **Diabetic Diet**\n*   **Diabetic Eye Problems**\n*   **Diabetic Heart Disease**\n*   **Diabetic Kidney Problems**\n*   **Diabetic Nerve Problems**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Medical Tests**\n\nThe following medical tests are related to diabetes:\n\n*   **Blood Glucose Test**\n*   **Fasting for a Blood Test**\n*   **Glucose in Urine Test**\n*   **Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) Test**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How to Cope with Medical Test Anxiety**\n\nIf you are experiencing anxiety about undergoing a medical test, there are several things you can do to help manage your stress:\n\n*   **Learn as much as you can**: Educate yourself about the test and what to expect.\n*   **Prepare physically and emotionally**: Get plenty of rest, eat well, and engage in relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation.\n*   **Seek support**: Talk to a friend or family member about your concerns.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How to Prepare for a Lab Test**\n\nTo prepare for a lab test, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Follow instructions carefully**: Pay attention to any pre-test instructions provided by your healthcare provider.\n2.  **Arrive early**: Plan to arrive at the testing facility with plenty of time to spare.\n3.  **Bring necessary documents**: Make sure you have all required identification and insurance information.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How to Understand Your Lab Results**\n\nWhen interpreting lab results, consider the following:\n\n*   **Understand the normal range**: Familiarize yourself with what constitutes a normal result for your specific test.\n*   **Look for patterns or trends**: Identify any changes or anomalies in your results over time.\n*   **Consult with your healthcare provider**: Discuss your results with your doctor to gain a deeper understanding of their implications.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Insulin in Blood**\n\nInsulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates blood sugar levels. Measuring insulin levels in the blood can help diagnose and monitor conditions such as diabetes or hypoglycemia.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What You Need to Know About Blood Testing**\n\nBlood testing is a crucial diagnostic tool for detecting various health conditions, including diabetes.

    "content": "**Diabetes and Alcohol**\n\nIf you have diabetes, you may wonder if it's safe to drink alcohol. While many people with diabetes can drink alcohol in moderation, it's important to understand the possible risks of alcohol use and what you can do to lower them.\n\n**Alcohol and Diabetes Medicines**\n\nSome people who take oral diabetes medicines should talk with their provider to see if it is safe to drink alcohol. Alcohol can interfere with the effects of some diabetes medicines, putting you at risk for low blood sugar or high blood sugar (hyperglycemia), depending on how much you drink and what medicine you take.\n\n**Other Risks for People with Diabetes**\n\nDrinking alcohol carries the same health risks for people with diabetes as it does in otherwise healthy people. But there are certain risks related to having diabetes that are important to know:\n\n*   Alcoholic drinks such as beer and sweetened mixed drinks are high in carbohydrates, which can raise blood sugar levels.\n*   Alcohol has a lot of calories, which can lead to weight gain. This makes it harder to manage diabetes.\n*   Calories from alcohol are stored in the liver as fat. Liver fat makes liver cells more insulin resistant and can make your blood sugars higher over time.\n\n**Symptoms of Low Blood Sugar**\n\nThe symptoms of low blood sugar are very similar to symptoms of alcohol intoxication. If you pass out, those around you may just think you are intoxicated. Being intoxicated makes it harder to recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar and increases the risk.\n\n**How Much Alcohol is Safe?**\n\nTo drink alcohol safely, you should be sure of the following:\n\n*   Your diabetes is in good control.\n*   You understand how alcohol may affect you and what steps to take to prevent problems.\n*   Your provider agrees that it is safe.\n\nAnyone who chooses to drink should do so in moderation:\n\n*   Women should have no more than 1 drink per day.\n*   Men should have no more than 2 drinks per day.\n\nOne drink is defined as:\n\n*   12 ounces (oz) or 360 milliliters (mL) of beer (5% alcohol content).\n*   5 oz or 150 mL of wine (12% alcohol content).\n*   1.5-oz or 45-mL shot of liquor (80 proof, or 40% alcohol content).\n\n**Things to Keep in Mind If You Choose to Drink**\n\nIf you decide to drink alcohol, taking these steps can help keep you safe:\n\n*   Do not drink alcohol on an empty stomach or when your blood glucose is low. Any time you drink alcohol, there is a risk of low blood sugar.\n*   Never skip meals or have alcohol in place of a meal.\n*   Drink slowly. If you consume liquor, mix it with water, club soda, diet tonic water, or diet soda.\n*   Carry a source of sugar, such as glucose tablets, in case of low blood sugar.\n*   If you count carbohydrates as part of your meal plan, talk with your provider about how to account for alcohol.\n*   Do not exercise if you have been drinking alcohol, as it increases the risk for low blood sugar.\n*   Carry visible medical ID stating that you have diabetes. This is important because the symptoms of too much alcohol and low blood sugar are similar.\n*   Avoid drinking alone. Drink with someone who knows that you have diabetes. The person should know what to do if you start having symptoms of low blood sugar.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nTalk with your provider if you or someone you know with diabetes has an alcohol problem. Also let your provider know if your drinking habits change.\n\nCall your provider if you feel symptoms of low blood sugar such as:\n\n*   Double vision or blurry vision\n*   Fast or pounding heartbeat\n*   Feeling cranky or acting aggressive\n*   Feeling nervous\n*   Headache\n*   Hunger\n*   Shaking or trembling\n*   Sweating\n*   Tingling or numbness of the skin\n*   Tiredness or weakness\n*   Trouble sleeping\n*   Unclear thinking\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes and Alcohol**\n\nIf you have diabetes, you may wonder if it's safe to drink alcohol. While many people with diabetes can drink alcohol in moderation, it's important to understand the possible risks of alcohol use and what you can do to lower them.\n\n**Low Blood Sugar**\n\nDrinking alcohol can cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) because your liver stops releasing glucose while processing the alcohol. This can lead to seriously low blood sugar if you take insulin or certain types of diabetes medicine. Drinking without eating food at the same time greatly increases this risk.\n\n* The risk for low blood sugar remains for hours after you take your last drink.\n* The more drinks you have at one time, the higher your risk.\n* Drink alcohol with food and in moderation to minimize this risk.\n\n**Alcohol and Diabetes Medicines**\n\nSome people who take oral diabetes medicines should talk with their provider to see if it is safe to drink alcohol. Alcohol can interfere with the effects of some diabetes medicines, putting you at risk for low blood sugar or high blood sugar (hyperglycemia), depending on how much you drink and what medicine you take.\n\n**Other Risks for People with Diabetes**\n\nDrinking alcohol carries the same health risks for people with diabetes as it does in otherwise healthy people.

The person should know what to do if you start having symptoms of low blood sugar.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nTalk with your provider if you or someone you know with diabetes has an alcohol problem. Also let your provider know if your drinking habits change.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes and the Risks of Drinking Alcohol**\n\nFor people with diabetes, drinking alcohol can cause low or high blood sugar, affect diabetes medicines, and cause other possible problems.\n\n**LOW BLOOD SUGAR**\n\nYour liver releases glucose into your blood stream as needed to help keep your blood sugar at normal levels. When you drink alcohol, your liver needs to break down the alcohol. While your liver is processing alcohol, it stops releasing glucose. As a result, your blood sugar level can drop quickly, putting you at risk for low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). If you take insulin or certain types of diabetes medicine, it can cause seriously low blood sugar. Drinking without eating food at the same time also greatly increases this risk.\n\nThe risk for low blood sugar remains for hours after you take your last drink. The more drinks you have at one time, the higher your risk. This is why you should only drink alcohol with food and drink only in moderation.\n\n**ALCOHOL AND DIABETES MEDICINES**\n\nSome people who take oral diabetes medicines should talk with their provider to see if it is safe to drink alcohol. Alcohol can interfere with the effects of some diabetes medicines, putting you at risk for low blood sugar or high blood sugar (hyperglycemia), depending on how much you drink and what medicine you take.\n\n**OTHER RISKS FOR PEOPLE WITH DIABETES**\n\nDrinking alcohol carries the same health risks for people with diabetes as it does in otherwise healthy people. But there are certain risks related to having diabetes that are important to know.\n\n* Alcoholic drinks such as beer and sweetened mixed drinks are high in carbohydrates, which can raise blood sugar levels.\n* Alcohol has a lot of calories, which can lead to weight gain. This makes it harder to manage diabetes.\n* Calories from alcohol are stored in the liver as fat. Liver fat makes liver cells more insulin resistant and can make your blood sugars higher over time.\n* Symptoms of low blood sugar are very similar to symptoms of alcohol intoxication. If you pass out, those around you may just think you are intoxicated.\n* Being intoxicated makes it harder to recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar and increases the risk.\n\n**HOW MUCH ALCOHOL IS SAFE?**\n\nTo drink alcohol safely, you should be sure of the following:\n\n* Your diabetes is in good control.\n* You understand how alcohol may affect you and what steps to take to prevent problems.\n* Your provider agrees that it is safe.\n\nAnyone who chooses to drink should do so in moderation:\n\n* Women should have no more than 1 drink per day.\n* Men should have no more than 2 drinks per day.\n\nOne drink is defined as:\n\n* 12 ounces (oz) or 360 milliliters (mL) of beer (5% alcohol content).\n* 5 oz or 150 mL of wine (12% alcohol content).\n* 1.5-oz or 45-mL shot of liquor (80 proof, or 40% alcohol content).\n\nTalk to your provider about how much alcohol is safe for you.\n\n**THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND IF YOU CHOOSE TO DRINK**\n\nIf you decide to drink alcohol, taking these steps can help keep you safe:\n\n* Do not drink alcohol on an empty stomach or when your blood glucose is low. Any time you drink alcohol, there is a risk of low blood sugar. Drink alcohol with a meal or with a carbohydrate-rich snack to maintain normal blood sugar levels.\n* Never skip meals or have alcohol in place of a meal.\n* Drink slowly. If you consume liquor, mix it with water, club soda, diet tonic water, or diet soda.\n* Carry a source of sugar, such as glucose tablets, in case of low blood sugar.\n* If you count carbohydrates as part of your meal plan, talk with your provider about how to account for alcohol.\n* Do not exercise if you have been drinking alcohol, as it increases the risk for low blood sugar.\n* Carry visible medical ID stating that you have diabetes. This is important because the symptoms of too much alcohol and low blood sugar are similar.\n* Avoid drinking alone. Drink with someone who knows that you have diabetes. The person should know what to do if you start having symptoms of low blood sugar.\n\nBecause alcohol puts you at risk for low blood sugar even hours after you drink, you should check your blood glucose:\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes and Alcohol**\n\nIf you have diabetes, it's essential to know what to do if you start experiencing symptoms of low blood sugar.\n\n**Checking Your Blood Glucose**\n\nBecause alcohol can put you at risk for low blood sugar even hours after drinking, make sure to check your blood glucose:\n\n* Before you start drinking\n* While you are drinking\n* A few hours after drinking\n* Up to the next 24 hours\n\nMake sure your blood glucose is at a safe level before going to sleep.\n\n**Things to Keep in Mind If You Choose to Drink**\n\nIf you decide to drink alcohol, take these steps to help keep yourself safe:\n\n* Do not drink on an empty stomach or when your blood glucose is low.\n* Any time you drink alcohol, there's a risk of low blood sugar. Drink with a meal or a carbohydrate-rich snack to maintain normal blood sugar levels.\n* Never skip meals or have alcohol in place of a meal.\n* Drink slowly and mix liquor with water, club soda, diet tonic water, or diet soda.\n* Carry a source of sugar, such as glucose tablets, in case of low blood sugar.\n* If you count carbohydrates as part of your meal plan, talk to your provider about how to account for alcohol.\n* Do not exercise if you have been drinking alcohol, as it increases the risk for low blood sugar.\n* Carry visible medical ID stating that you have diabetes. This is crucial because the symptoms of too much alcohol and low blood sugar are similar.\n* Avoid drinking alone. Drink with someone who knows that you have diabetes and can help if you start experiencing symptoms of low blood sugar.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nTalk to your provider if you or someone you know with diabetes has an alcohol problem. Also, let your provider know if your drinking habits change.\n\nCall your provider if you experience symptoms of low blood sugar, such as:\n\n* Double vision or blurry vision\n* Fast or pounding heartbeat\n* Feeling cranky or acting aggressive\n* Feeling nervous\n* Headache\n* Hunger\n* Shaking or trembling\n* Sweating\n* Tingling or numbness of the skin\n* Tiredness or weakness\n* Trouble sleeping\n* Unclear thinking",

    "content": "**Diabetes and Exercise**\n\nExercise is an essential part of managing diabetes. If you're obese or overweight, regular physical activity can help you manage your weight effectively.\n\n**Benefits of Exercise for Diabetes**\n\n*   Helps lower blood sugar without the need for medication\n*   Reduces the risk of heart disease\n*   Lessens symptoms of depression and reduces stress\n\nHowever, it's crucial to be patient as it may take several months of consistent exercising before noticeable changes in your health occur. Understanding that exercise can benefit your overall well-being even if it doesn't lead to significant weight loss is vital.\n\n**Consulting Your Doctor**\n\nBefore starting an exercise program, consult with your healthcare provider to ensure it's safe for you. They may ask about symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or leg pain when walking uphill. In rare cases, they may order tests to guarantee your heart can handle the physical demands.\n\nIf you're taking medications that lower blood sugar, exercise can cause blood sugar levels to drop too low. Discuss with your provider or nurse how to adjust your medication schedule or dosages to prevent hypoglycemia.\n\n**Getting Started**\n\nBegin with walking, especially if you're out of shape. Aim for 5-10 minutes a day and gradually increase the duration and frequency.\n\n*   Set a goal for fast walking (30-45 minutes, at least 5 days a week)\n*   Consider swimming or exercise classes as alternative options\n*   If you don't have a safe place to walk or experience pain while walking, start with body weight exercises in the comfort of your own home\n\n**Safety Precautions**\n\n*   Wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace to signal your diabetes status\n*   Inform coaches and exercise partners about your condition\n*   Always carry fast-acting sources of sugar (e.g., juice or hard candy) with you\n*   Keep a cell phone handy with emergency contact numbers\n\n**Monitoring Blood Sugar**\n\nRegularly check your blood sugar levels before, during, and after exercising. This will help you understand how exercise affects your glucose response.\n\n*   Test your blood sugar before exercising\n*   Check it again right after exercise and later on (up to 12 hours post-exercise)\n*   If using insulin, consult with your provider about adjusting dosages or meal plans\n\n**Foot Care**\n\nAlways inspect your feet and shoes for any issues before and after exercise. Due to diabetes, you might not feel pain in your feet, so it's essential to be proactive.\n\n*   Wear socks that keep moisture away from your feet\n*   Choose comfortable, well-fitting shoes\n*   Report any changes or concerns to your provider\n\n**References**\n\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 5.

They will assess individual fitness levels and medical conditions to ensure safe participation.\n\n**Starting an Exercise Program**\n\n1.  **Begin with walking**: Start with short walks (5-10 minutes) and gradually increase duration and frequency.\n2.  **Set realistic goals**: Aim for at least 30-45 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, 5 days a week.\n3.  **Incorporate variety**: Mix aerobic exercises like swimming or cycling with strength-training activities.\n\n**Safety Precautions**\n\n*   Monitor blood sugar levels before, during, and after exercise\n*   Adjust medication doses as needed to prevent low blood sugar\n*   Wear a medical alert device or inform exercise partners about diabetes\n\nBy following these guidelines and consulting with a healthcare provider, individuals with diabetes can safely and effectively incorporate exercise into their lifestyle.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes and Exercise**\n\n**Getting Started**\n\nStart with walking. If you are out of shape, start by walking for 5 to 10 minutes a day.\n\nTry to set a goal of fast walking. You should do this for 30 to 45 minutes, at least 5 days a week. In order to lose weight, the amount of exercise may need to be greater. So do more if you can. Swimming or exercise classes are also good.\n\nIf you don't have a safe place to walk, or have pain when walking, you can start with body weight exercises in your home. Talk to your provider about which exercises are right for you.\n\nWear a bracelet or necklace that says you have diabetes. Tell coaches and exercise partners that you have diabetes. Always have fast-acting sources of sugar with you, such as juice or hard candy. Carry a cell phone with emergency phone numbers with you, as well.\n\nDrink plenty of water. Do this before, during, and after exercising. Try to exercise at the same time of day, for the same amount of time, and at the same level. This will make your blood sugar easier to control. If your schedule is less regular, exercising at different times of the day is still better than not exercising at all.\n\nTry to avoid sitting for more than 30 minutes at a time. Get up and stretch. Walk or do some quick exercises like lunges, squats, or wall push-ups.\n\n**Your Blood Sugar and Exercise**\n\nThe blood sugar response to exercise is not always easy to predict. Different types of exercises can make blood sugar go up or down. Most of the time, your response to any specific exercise will be the same. Testing your blood sugar more often is the safest plan.\n\nCheck your blood sugar before you exercise. Also, check it during exercise if you are working out for more than 45 minutes, especially if this is an exercise you have not done regularly.\n\nCheck your blood sugar again right after exercise, and later on. Exercise can cause your blood sugar to decrease for up to 12 hours after you are done.\n\n**Talk to Your Doctor First**\n\nYour health care provider should make sure your exercise program is safe for you. An exercise program is safe for most people with diabetes. Your provider may ask about symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or leg pain that you may get when you walk upstairs or up a hill. In rare cases, your provider will order tests to make sure that you can exercise safely without damaging your heart.\n\nIf you take medicines that lower your blood sugar, exercise can make your blood sugar go too low. Talk to your provider or nurse about how to take your medicines when you exercise or how to adjust the doses to prevent low blood sugars.\n\nSome types of vigorous exercise can make your eyes worse if you already have diabetic eye disease. Get an eye exam before starting a new exercise program.\n\nAfter you start your exercise program, contact your provider if you have any of the following:\n\n* Feel faint, have chest pain, or feel short of breath when you exercise\n* Feel pain or numbness in your feet. Also contact your provider if you have sores or blisters on your feet\n* Your blood sugar gets too low or too high during or after exercising\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes and Exercise**\n\nIf you have diabetes, exercising regularly can help manage your blood sugar levels. However, it's essential to be aware of the potential effects of exercise on your blood sugar.\n\n**Checking Your Blood Sugar**\n\nBefore exercising, check your blood sugar level to ensure it's within a safe range. If you're planning to engage in strenuous exercise or haven't exercised regularly, check your blood sugar again during exercise and after you've finished.\n\nExercise can cause your blood sugar to decrease for up to 12 hours after you've stopped. If you use insulin, ask your healthcare provider when and what to eat before exercising and how to adjust your insulin dose accordingly.\n\n**Snacking During Exercise**\n\nKeep a snack nearby that can raise your blood sugar quickly, such as:\n\n* Five or six small soft candies\n* One tablespoon (tbsp) of sugar, plain or dissolved in water\n* One tbsp of honey or syrup\n* Three or four glucose tablets\n* One half of a 12-ounce can of regular, non-diet soda or sports drink\n* One half cup (4 ounces or 118 mL) of fruit juice\n\nHave a larger snack if you'll be exercising more than usual. You may need to adjust your medicine if you're planning unusual exercise.\n\n**Monitoring Your Feet**\n\nAlways check your feet and shoes for any problems before and after exercise. You might not feel pain in your feet due to diabetes, so it's crucial to inspect them regularly. Contact your healthcare provider if you notice any changes on your feet, as small problems can become serious if left untreated.\n\nWear socks that keep moisture away from your feet and comfortable, well-fitting shoes. If you experience redness, swelling, and warmth across the middle of your foot or ankle after exercise, let your provider know right away, as this could be a sign of Charcot foot, a joint problem more common in people with diabetes.\n\n**References**\n\n* American Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 5.

If you need help quitting, ask your provider.\n* Women with diabetes who become pregnant should have more frequent eye exams during pregnancy and for a year after delivery.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes and Eye Disease**\n\nIf you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk of damage from high blood sugar levels. This can lead to diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can cause blurred vision, floaters, shadows or missing areas of vision, and trouble seeing at night.\n\n**Causes**\n\nDiabetic retinopathy is caused by damage from diabetes to the small blood vessels in the retina, the back part of your eye. The retina changes light and images into nerve signals sent to the brain. People with type 1 or type 2 diabetes are at risk for this condition.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMost people with diabetic retinopathy have no symptoms until the damage is severe. Symptoms may include:\n\n* Blurred vision and slow vision loss over time\n* Floaters\n* Shadows or missing areas of vision\n* Trouble seeing at night\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour eye doctor will examine your eyes, which may involve reading an eye chart, receiving eye drops to widen your pupils, and tests such as tonometry, slit lamp exam, and fluorescein angiography.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nPeople with early diabetic retinopathy may not need treatment, but they should be closely followed by an eye doctor. If new blood vessels start growing in the eye or macular edema develops, treatment is usually needed. Eye surgery, including laser photocoagulation and vitrectomy, may be necessary to repair damaged blood vessels or remove bleeding.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nGood control of blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol are crucial for preventing diabetic retinopathy. Quitting smoking and having regular eye exams can also help prevent complications.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf you have diabetes and experience any of the following symptoms, contact your provider:\n\n* Reduced vision in dim light\n* Blind spots\n* Double vision\n* Hazy or blurry vision\n* Pain in one eye\n* Headaches\n* Spots floating in your eyes\n* Vision loss on the side of your field of vision\n* Shadows\n\nRemember to manage your diabetes by eating healthy foods, getting regular exercise, checking your blood sugar regularly, and taking medicine or insulin as instructed.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes and Eye Disease**\n\nDiabetes can harm the eyes. It can damage the small blood vessels in the retina, the back part of your eye. This condition is called diabetic retinopathy.\n\nDiabetes also increases the chance of having glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye problems.\n\n**Causes**\n\nDiabetic retinopathy is caused by damage from diabetes to blood vessels of the retina. The retina is the layer of tissue at the back of the inner eye. It changes light and images that enter the eye into nerve signals, which are sent to the brain.\n\nDiabetic retinopathy is a main cause of decreased vision or blindness in Americans ages 20 to 74 years. People with type 1 or type 2 diabetes are at risk for this condition. Some people who have type 2 diabetes that develops slowly already have eye damage when they are first diagnosed.\n\nWatch this video about: Diabetes - retinal conditions\n\nThe chance of developing retinopathy and having a more severe form is higher when:\n\n* You have had diabetes for a long time.\n* Your blood sugar (glucose) has been poorly controlled.\n* You also smoke or you have high blood pressure or high cholesterol.\n\nIf you already have damage to the blood vessels in your eye, some types of exercise can make the problem worse. Check with your health care provider before starting an exercise program.\n\nOther eye problems that can occur in people with diabetes include:\n\n* Cataract -- Cloudiness of the eye lens.\n* Glaucoma -- Increased pressure in the eye that can lead to blindness.\n* Macular edema -- Blurry vision due to fluid leaking into the area of the retina that provides sharp central vision.\n* Retinal detachment -- Scarring that may cause part of the retina to pull away from the back of your eyeball.\n\nHigh blood sugar or rapid changes in blood sugar level often cause blurred vision that is usually brief and temporary. This is because the lens in the middle of the eye cannot change shape when it has too much sugar and water in the lens. This is not the same problem as diabetic retinopathy.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMost often, diabetic retinopathy has no symptoms until the damage to your eyes is severe. This is because damage to much of the retina can occur before your vision is affected.\n\nSymptoms of diabetic retinopathy include:\n\n* Blurred vision and slow vision loss over time\n* Floaters\n* Shadows or missing areas of vision\n* Trouble seeing at night\n\nMany people with early diabetic retinopathy have no symptoms before bleeding occurs in the eye. This is why everyone with diabetes should have regular eye exams.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour eye doctor will examine your eyes. You may first be asked to read an eye chart. Then you will receive eye drops to widen the pupils of your eyes. Tests you may have involve:\n\n* Measuring the fluid pressure inside your eyes (tonometry)\n* Checking the structures inside your eyes (slit lamp exam)\n* Checking and photographing your retinas (fluorescein angiography)\n\nIf you have the early stage of diabetic retinopathy (nonproliferative), the eye doctor may see:\n\n* Blood vessels in the eye that are larger in certain spots (called microaneurysms)\n* Blood vessels that are blocked\n* Small amounts of bleeding (retinal hemorrhages) and fluid leaking into the retina\n\nIf you have advanced retinopathy (proliferative), the eye doctor may see:\n\nNote: The cleaned output has been formatted to be more readable, with bold headings and bullet points used to separate sections.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes and Eye Disease**\n\n**What is Diabetic Retinopathy?**\n\nDiabetic retinopathy is a condition that affects people with diabetes. It occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the retina, causing them to become weak and leaky.\n\n**Symptoms of Diabetic Retinopathy**\n\nIf you have advanced retinopathy (proliferative), your eye doctor may see:\n\n* New blood vessels starting to grow in the eye that are weak and can bleed\n* Small scars forming on the retina and in other parts of the eye (the vitreous)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour eye doctor will examine your eyes. You may first be asked to read an eye chart. Then you will receive eye drops to widen the pupils of your eyes. Tests you may have involve:\n\n* Measuring the fluid pressure inside your eyes (tonometry)\n* Checking the structures inside your eyes (slit lamp exam)\n* Checking and photographing your retinas (fluorescein angiography)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nPeople with early diabetic retinopathy may not need treatment. But they should be closely followed by an eye doctor who is trained to diagnose and treat diabetic eye diseases.\n\nIf your eye doctor notices new blood vessels growing in your retina (neovascularization) or you develop macular edema, treatment is usually needed.\n\nEye surgery is the main treatment for diabetic retinopathy.\n\n* Laser eye surgery creates small burns in the retina where there are abnormal blood vessels. This process is called photocoagulation. It is used to keep vessels from leaking, or to shrink abnormal vessels.\n* Surgery called vitrectomy is used when there is bleeding (hemorrhage) into the eye. It may also be used to repair retinal detachment.\n\nMedicines that are injected into the eyeball may help prevent abnormal blood vessels from growing and improve macular edema.\n\nFollow your eye doctor's advice on how to protect your vision. Have eye exams as often as recommended, usually once every 1 to 2 years.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nMore information and support for people with diabetes and their families can be found at:\n\n* American Diabetes Association -- www.diabetes.org\n* National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases -- www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes\n* Prevent Blindness America -- www.preventblindness.org\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nManaging your diabetes may help slow diabetic retinopathy and other eye problems. Control your blood sugar (glucose) level by:\n\n* Eating healthy foods\n* Getting regular exercise\n* Checking your blood sugar as often as instructed by your diabetes provider and keeping a record of your numbers so you know the types of foods and activities that affect your blood sugar level\n* Taking medicine or insulin as instructed\n\nTreatments can reduce vision loss. They do not cure diabetic retinopathy or reverse the changes that have already occurred.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes and Eye Disease**\n\nIf you have diabetes, it's essential to take care of your eyes. Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication that can lead to reduced vision and blindness.\n\n**Managing Your Diabetes**\n\nTo prevent diabetic retinopathy, manage your diabetes by:\n\n*   Keeping good control of blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol\n*   Not smoking (if you need help quitting, ask your provider)\n*   Having more frequent eye exams during pregnancy and for a year after delivery (if you're pregnant with diabetes)\n\n**Recognizing the Symptoms**\n\nIf you experience any of the following symptoms, contact your provider:\n\n*   You cannot see well in dim light\n*   You have blind spots\n*   You have double vision (you see two things when there is only one)\n*   Your vision is hazy or blurry and you cannot focus\n*   You have pain in one of your eyes\n*   You are having headaches\n*   You see spots floating in your eyes\n*   You cannot see things on the side of your field of vision\n*   You see shadows\n\n**Preventing Diabetic Retinopathy**\n\nGood control of blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol are crucial for preventing diabetic retinopathy. Don't smoke, and if you need help quitting, ask your provider. Women with diabetes who become pregnant should have more frequent eye exams during pregnancy and for a year after delivery.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCall an eye doctor (optometrist or ophthalmologist) if you have diabetes and haven't seen one in the past year. If you experience any of the symptoms mentioned above, contact your provider.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nDiabetic retinopathy is also known as:\n\n*   Retinopathy - diabetic\n*   Photocoagulation - retina\n*   Diabetic retinopathy\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\nTo take care of your eyes with diabetes:\n\n*   Follow your diabetes treatment plan\n*   Keep a record of your numbers to understand how foods and activities affect your blood sugar level\n*   Take medicine or insulin as instructed",

This type of kidney disease is called diabetic nephropathy.\n\n**Causes**\n\nEach kidney is made of hundreds of thousands of small units called nephrons. These structures filter your blood, help remove waste from the body, and control fluid balance.\n\nIn people with diabetes, the nephrons slowly thicken and become scarred over time. The nephrons begin to leak, and protein (albumin) passes into the urine. This damage can happen years before any symptoms of kidney disease begin. Some people who have type 2 diabetes that develops slowly already have kidney damage when they are first diagnosed.\n\nKidney damage is more likely if you:\n\n* Have uncontrolled blood sugar (glucose)\n* Are obese\n* Have high blood pressure\n* Have type 1 diabetes that began before you were 20 years old\n* Have family members who also have diabetes and kidney problems\n* Smoke\n* Are African American, Mexican American, or Native American\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nOften, there are no symptoms as the kidney damage starts and slowly gets worse. Kidney damage can begin 5 to 10 years before symptoms start.\n\nPeople who have more severe and long-term (chronic) kidney disease may have symptoms such as:\n\n* Fatigue most of the time\n* General ill feeling\n* Headache\n* Irregular heartbeat\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Poor appetite\n* Swelling of the legs\n* Shortness of breath\n* Itchy skin\n* Easily develop infections\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will order tests to detect signs of kidney problems.\n\nA urine test looks for a protein, called albumin, leaking into the urine. Too much albumin in the urine is often a sign of kidney damage.\n\nYour provider will also check your blood pressure. High blood pressure damages your kidneys, and blood pressure is harder to control when you have kidney damage.\n\nA kidney biopsy may be ordered to confirm the diagnosis or look for other causes of kidney damage.\n\nIf you have diabetes, your provider will also check your kidneys by using the following blood tests every year:\n\n* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)\n* Serum creatinine\n* Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nWhen kidney damage is caught in its early stages, it can be slowed with treatment. Once larger amounts of protein appear in the urine, kidney damage will slowly get worse.\n\nFollow your provider's advice to keep your condition from getting worse.\n\nCONTROL YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE\n\nKeeping your blood pressure under control (below 130/80 milliliters of mercury (mm Hg)) is one of the best ways to slow kidney damage.\n\nYour provider will prescribe blood pressure medicines known as ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers to protect your kidneys from more damage if your microalbumin test is too high on at least two measurements.\n\nCONTROL YOUR BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL\n\nYou can also slow kidney damage by controlling your blood sugar level through:\n\n* Eating healthy foods\n* Getting regular exercise\n* Taking oral or injectable medicines as instructed by your provider\n* Some diabetes medicines are known to prevent the progression of diabetic nephropathy better than other medicines. Talk to your provider about which medicines are best for you.\n* Checking your blood sugar level as often as instructed and keeping a record of your blood sugar numbers so that you know how meals and activities affect your level\n\nOTHER WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR KIDNEYS\n\nContrast dye that is sometimes used with an MRI, CT scan, or other imaging test can cause more damage to your kidneys. Tell the provider who is ordering the test that you have diabetes. Follow instructions about drinking lots of water after the procedure to flush the dye out of your system.\n\nAvoid taking a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen or naproxen for pain. Ask your provider if there is another kind of medicine that you can take instead. NSAIDs can damage the kidneys, more so when you use them every day.\n\nYour provider may need to stop or change other medicines that can damage your kidneys.\n\nKnow the signs of urinary tract infections and get them treated right away.\n\nHaving a low level of vitamin D may worsen kidney disease. Ask your provider if you need to take vitamin D supplements.\n\nDo not use tobacco.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nMany resources can help you understand more about diabetes. You can also learn ways to manage your kidney disease.\n\nMore information and support for people with diabetes and their families can be found at:\n\n* American Diabetes Association -- www.diabetes.org\n* National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases -- www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nDiabetic kidney disease is a major cause of sickness and death in people with diabetes. It can lead to the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have diabetes and you have not had a urine test to check for protein.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes and Kidney Disease**\n\n**What is Diabetic Nephropathy?**\n\nKidney disease or kidney damage often occurs over time in people with diabetes.

    "content": "**Diabetes and Nerve Damage**\n\nNerve damage that occurs in people with diabetes is called diabetic neuropathy. This condition is a complication of diabetes.\n\n**Causes**\n\nIn people with diabetes, the body's nerves can be damaged by decreased blood flow and a high blood sugar (glucose) level. This condition is more likely when the blood sugar level is not well controlled over time.\n\nAbout one half of people with diabetes develop nerve damage. Symptoms often do not begin until many years after diabetes has been diagnosed. Some people who have diabetes that develops slowly already have nerve damage when they are first diagnosed.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms often develop slowly over many years. The types of symptoms you have depend on the nerves that are affected.\n\nNerves in the feet and legs are most often affected. Symptoms often start in the toes and feet, and include tingling or burning, or deep pain. Over time, nerve damage can also occur in the fingers and hands. As the damage gets worse, you may lose feeling in your toes, feet, and legs. Your skin may become numb. Because of this, you may:\n\n* Not notice when you step on something sharp\n* Not know that you have a blister or small cut\n* Not notice when your feet or hands touch something that is too hot or cold\n* Have feet that are very dry and cracked\n\nWhen the nerves that control digestion are affected, you may have trouble digesting food due to reduced movement of the stomach (gastroparesis). This can make your diabetes harder to control. Damage to nerves that control digestion almost always occurs in people with severe nerve damage in their feet and legs. Symptoms of digestion problems include:\n\n* Feeling full after eating only a small amount of food\n* Heartburn and bloating\n* Nausea, constipation, or diarrhea\n* Swallowing problems\n* Throwing up undigested food a few hours after a meal\n\nWhen nerves in your heart and blood vessels are damaged, you may:\n\n* Feel lightheaded when you stand up (orthostatic hypotension)\n* Have a fast heart rate\n* Not notice angina, the chest pain that warns of heart disease and heart attack\n\nOther symptoms of nerve damage are:\n\n* Sexual problems, which cause trouble getting an erection in men and vaginal dryness or orgasm problems in women.\n* Not being able to tell when your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycemia unawareness).\n* Bladder problems, which cause urine leakage or not being able to empty the bladder.\n* Sweating too much, even when the temperature is cool, when you're at rest, or at other unusual times.\n* Feet that are very sweaty (early nerve damage).\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will do a physical exam. The exam may find that you have the following:\n\n* No reflexes or weak reflexes in the ankle\n* Loss of feeling in the feet (this is checked with a brush-like instrument called a monofilament)\n* Changes in the skin, including dry skin, hair loss, and thick or discolored nails\n* Loss of the ability to sense movement of your joints (proprioception)\n* Loss of the ability to sense vibration of a tuning fork\n* Loss of the ability to sense heat or cold\n* Drop in blood pressure when you stand up after sitting or lying down\n\nTests that may be ordered include:\n\n* Electromyogram (EMG), a recording of electrical activity in muscles\n* Nerve conduction velocity tests (NCV), a recording of the speed at which signals travel along nerves\n* Gastric emptying study to check how fast food leaves the stomach and enters the small intestine\n* Tilt table study to check if the nervous system is properly controlling blood pressure\n\nYour provider should check to see if your blood vitamin B12 level is normal, as low levels can contribute to neuropathy symptoms.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nFollow your provider's advice on how to slow diabetic nerve damage.\n\nControl your blood sugar (glucose) level by:\n\n* Eating healthy foods\n* Getting regular exercise\n* Checking your blood sugar as often as instructed and keeping a record of your numbers so that you know the types of foods and activities that affect your blood sugar level\n* Taking oral or injected medicines as instructed by your provider\n\nTo treat the symptoms of nerve damage, your provider may prescribe medicines to treat:\n\n* Pain in your feet, legs, or arms\n* Nausea, vomiting, or other digestion problems\n* Bladder problems\n* Erection problems or vaginal dryness\n\nIf you're prescribed medicines for symptoms of nerve damage, be aware of the following:\n\n* The medicines are often less effective if your blood sugar is usually high.\n* After you start the medicine, tell your provider if the nerve pain doesn't improve.\n\n**Caring for Your Feet**\n\nWhen you have nerve damage in your feet, the feeling in your feet can be reduced. You can even have no feeling at all. As a result, your feet may not heal well if they are injured. Caring for your feet can prevent minor problems from becoming so serious that you end up in the hospital.\n\nCaring for your feet includes:\n\n* Checking your feet every day\n* Getting a foot exam each time you see your provider\n* Wearing the right kind of socks and shoes (ask your provider about this)\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nMany resources can help you understand more about diabetes.

The exam may find that you have the following:\n\n* No reflexes or weak reflexes in the ankle\n* Loss of feeling in the feet (this is checked with a brush-like instrument called a monofilament)\n* Changes in the skin, including dry skin, hair loss, and thick or discolored nails\n* Loss of the ability to sense movement of your joints (proprioception)\n* Loss of the ability to sense vibration of a tuning fork\n* Loss of the ability to sense heat or cold\n* Drop in blood pressure when you stand up after sitting or lying down\n\nTests that may be ordered include:\n\n* Electromyogram (EMG), a recording of electrical activity in muscles\n* Nerve conduction velocity tests (NCV), a recording of the speed at which signals travel along nerves\n* Gastric emptying study to check how fast food leaves the stomach and enters the small intestine\n* Tilt table study to check if the nervous system is properly controlling blood pressure\n\nYour provider should also check your blood vitamin B12 level, as low levels can contribute to neuropathy symptoms.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes and Nerve Damage**\n\n**What is Diabetic Neuropathy?**\n\nDiabetic neuropathy is a serious complication of diabetes that can cause nerve damage, leading to various symptoms.\n\n**Symptoms of Diabetic Neuropathy**\n\nSome common symptoms include:\n\n* Loss of sensation in the feet\n* Pain or numbness in the feet or legs\n* Difficulty walking or maintaining balance\n* Tingling or burning sensations in the feet or legs\n* Reduced ability to sense vibration, heat, or cold\n\n**Tests for Diabetic Neuropathy**\n\nThe following tests may be ordered:\n\n* Electromyogram (EMG), a recording of electrical activity in muscles\n* Nerve conduction velocity tests (NCV), a recording of the speed at which signals travel along nerves\n* Gastric emptying study to check how fast food leaves the stomach and enters the small intestine\n* Tilt table study to check if the nervous system is properly controlling blood pressure\n\n**Physical Exam**\n\nYour health care provider will do a physical exam, which may find that you have:\n\n* Reduced reflexes\n* Muscle weakness or wasting\n* Abnormal sensations in the feet or legs\n\n**Treatment of Diabetic Neuropathy**\n\nFollow your provider's advice on how to slow diabetic nerve damage. Control your blood sugar (glucose) level by:\n\n* Eating healthy foods\n* Getting regular exercise\n* Checking your blood sugar as often as instructed and keeping a record of your numbers so that you know the types of foods and activities that affect your blood sugar level\n* Taking oral or injected medicines as instructed by your provider\n\n**Medicines for Symptoms**\n\nYour provider may prescribe medicines to treat:\n\n* Pain in your feet, legs, or arms\n* Nausea, vomiting, or other digestion problems\n* Bladder problems\n* Erection problems or vaginal dryness\n\n**Caring for Your Feet**\n\nWhen you have nerve damage in your feet, the feeling can be reduced. You can even have no feeling at all. As a result, your feet may not heal well if they are injured. Caring for your feet can prevent minor problems from becoming so serious that you end up in the hospital.\n\nCaring for your feet includes:\n\n* Checking your feet every day\n* Getting a foot exam each time you see your provider\n* Wearing the right kind of socks and shoes (ask your provider about this)\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nMany resources can help you understand more about diabetes. You can also learn ways to manage your diabetic nerve disease.\n\nMore information and support for people with diabetes and their families can be found at:\n\n* American Diabetes Association -- www.diabetes.org\n* National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases -- www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nTreatment relieves pain and controls some symptoms. However, other problems that may develop include:\n\n* Bladder or kidney infection\n* Diabetes foot ulcers\n* Nerve damage that hides the symptoms of the chest pain (angina) that warns of heart disease and a heart attack\n* Loss of a toe, foot, or leg through amputation, often because of a bone infection that does not heal\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you develop any symptoms of diabetic neuropathy.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes and Nerve Damage**\n\n**What is nerve damage?**\n\nNerve damage, also known as neuropathy, is a common complication of diabetes. It occurs when the high blood sugar levels damage the nerves, leading to numbness, tingling, and pain in the hands and feet.\n\n**Causes of nerve damage**\n\nThe exact causes of nerve damage are not fully understood, but it is believed that high blood sugar levels over time can damage the nerves. Other factors that may contribute to nerve damage include:\n\n*   **Genetics**: Some people may be more prone to nerve damage due to their genetic makeup.\n*   **Age**: Nerve damage is more common in older adults.\n*   **Duration of diabetes**: The longer a person has diabetes, the higher their risk of developing nerve damage.\n\n**Symptoms of nerve damage**\n\nThe symptoms of nerve damage can vary from person to person, but common complaints include:\n\n*   **Numbness or tingling**: A feeling of numbness or tingling in the hands and feet.\n*   **Pain**: Pain in the hands and feet that can be severe and debilitating.\n*   **Weakness**: Weakness in the muscles of the hands and feet.\n\n**Diagnosing nerve damage**\n\nDiagnosing nerve damage typically involves a physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests. The doctor may also perform a nerve conduction study to assess the speed and strength of electrical signals along nerves.\n\n**Treatment options for nerve damage**\n\nWhile there is no cure for nerve damage, treatment can help manage symptoms and prevent further damage. Treatment options include:\n\n*   **Medications**: Medications such as gabapentin and pregabalin can help relieve pain and numbness.\n*   **Lifestyle changes**: Making healthy lifestyle choices, such as maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and eating a balanced diet, can help manage blood sugar levels and prevent further nerve damage.\n\n**Preventing nerve damage**\n\nPreventing nerve damage is key to managing diabetes. To reduce the risk of developing nerve damage, people with diabetes should:\n\n*   **Monitor their blood sugar levels**: Keeping blood sugar levels within a healthy range can help prevent nerve damage.\n*   **Exercise regularly**: Regular exercise can help improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of nerve damage.\n*   **Eat a balanced diet**: Eating a balanced diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources can help manage blood sugar levels and prevent further nerve damage.\n\nBy understanding the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment options, and prevention strategies for nerve damage, people with diabetes can take steps to protect their nerves and maintain overall health.",

    "content": "**Diabetes Eye Care**\n\nIf you have diabetes, work with your health care provider to take good care of your eyes. Diabetes can harm your eyes by damaging the small blood vessels in your retina, leading to diabetic retinopathy. It also increases your risk of having glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye problems.\n\n**Diabetes and Your Eyes**\n\nYou may not know there is any damage to your eyes until the problem is very bad. However, your provider can catch problems early if you get regular eye exams. If your provider finds eye problems early, medicines and other treatments may help prevent them from getting worse.\n\n**You Need Regular Eye Exams**\n\nEvery year, you should have an eye exam by an eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist). Choose an eye doctor who takes care of people with diabetes. Your eye exam may include:\n\n* Dilating your eyes and using specialized equipment to allow a good view of the entire retina.\n* At times, special photographs of your retina may replace the dilated eye exam.\n\nYour eye doctor may ask you to come more or less often than once a year depending on the eye exam results and how well your blood sugar is controlled.\n\n**How to Prevent Eye Problems**\n\nControl your blood sugar levels. High blood sugar increases your chance of having eye problems. High blood sugar can also cause blurred vision that is not related to diabetic retinopathy.\n\n* Control your blood pressure: A goal for people with diabetes is a blood pressure less than 130/80.\n* Have your blood pressure checked often and at least twice each year.\n* If you take medicines to control your blood pressure, take them as your provider instructs.\n* Control your cholesterol levels: Abnormal cholesterol levels can also lead to diabetic retinopathy.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\nDo not smoke. If you need help quitting, ask your provider. If you already have eye problems, ask your provider if you should avoid exercises that can strain the blood vessels in your eyes. Exercises that may make eye problems worse include:\n\n* Weight lifting and other exercises that make you strain\n* High-impact exercise, such as football or hockey\n\n**Making Your Home Safe**\n\nIf your vision is affected by diabetes, make sure your home is safe enough that your chance of falling is low. Ask your provider about having a home assessment done.\n\n**Taking Medicines**\n\nIf you cannot read the labels on your medicines easily:\n\n* Use felt tip pens to label medicine bottles, so you can read them easily.\n* Use rubber bands or clips to tell medicine bottles apart.\n* Ask someone else to give you your medicines.\n* Always read labels with a magnifying lens.\n* Use a pillbox with compartments for days of the week and times of the day, if you need to take medicines more than once a day.\n\nNever guess when taking your medicines. If you are unsure of your doses, talk with your provider, nurse, or pharmacist.\n\n**Organizing Your Medicines**\n\nKeep medicines and other household items organized in a cabinet so you know where they are.\n\n**Cooking and Reading Recipes**\n\nUse large-print cookbooks\nUse a full-page magnifier\nUse a high-definition (HD) magnifier\nFor online recipes, use the zoom function on your keyboard to make the font bigger on your monitor\n\nAsk your eye doctor about other low vision aids.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if you have any of the following:\n\n* Cannot see well in dim light\n* Have blind spots\n* Have double vision (you see two things when there is only one)\n* Vision is hazy or blurry and you cannot focus\n* Eye pain\n* Headaches\n* Spots floating in your eyes\n* Cannot see things on the side of your field of vision\n* See shadows\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes Eye Care**\n\nIf you have diabetes, you may not know there is any damage to your eyes until the problem is very bad.

    "content": "**Diabetes Insipidus**\n\nDiabetes insipidus (DI) is an uncommon condition in which the kidneys are unable to prevent the excretion of water.\n\n**Causes**\n\nDuring the day, your kidneys filter all your blood many times. Normally, most of the water is reabsorbed, and only a small amount of concentrated urine, relative to the volume of blood, is excreted. DI occurs when your kidneys cannot concentrate the urine normally, and a large amount of dilute urine is excreted.\n\nThe amount of water excreted in the urine is controlled by antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is also called vasopressin. ADH is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. It is then stored and released from the pituitary gland. This is a small gland just below the base of the brain.\n\nDI caused by a lack of ADH is called central diabetes insipidus. When DI is caused by a failure of the kidneys to respond to ADH, the condition is called nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Nephrogenic means related to the kidney.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of DI include:\n\n* Excessive thirst that may be intense or uncontrollable, usually with the need to drink large amounts of water or craving for ice water\n* Excessive urine volume\n* Excessive urination, often needing to urinate every hour throughout the day and night\n* Very dilute, pale urine\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will ask about your medical history and symptoms.\n\nTests that may be ordered include:\n\n* Blood sodium and osmolality\n* Desmopressin (DDAVP) challenge\n* MRI of the head\n* Serum co-peptin level\n* Urinalysis\n* Urine concentration and osmolality\n* Urine output\n\nYour provider may have you see a doctor who specializes in pituitary diseases to help diagnose DI.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe cause of the underlying condition will be treated when possible.\n\nCentral DI may be controlled with vasopressin (desmopressin, DDAVP). You may take vasopressin as an injection, a nasal spray, or tablets.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes Insipidus**\n\n**What is Diabetes Insipidus?**\n\nDiabetes insipidus (DI) is an uncommon condition in which the kidneys are unable to prevent the excretion of water.\n\n**Is it the same as Diabetes Mellitus?**\n\nNo, DI is not the same as diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2. However, untreated, both DI and diabetes mellitus cause constant thirst and frequent urination. People with diabetes mellitus have high blood sugar (glucose). Those with DI have normal blood sugar levels, but their kidneys are not able to balance fluid and salt in the body.\n\n**Causes**\n\nDuring the day, your kidneys filter all your blood many times. Normally, most of the water is reabsorbed, and only a small amount of concentrated urine, relative to the volume of blood, is excreted. DI occurs when your kidneys cannot concentrate the urine normally, and a large amount of dilute urine is excreted.\n\nThe amount of water excreted in the urine is controlled by antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is also called vasopressin. ADH is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. It is then stored and released from the pituitary gland. This is a small gland just below the base of the brain.\n\nDI caused by a lack of ADH is called central diabetes insipidus. When DI is caused by a failure of the kidneys to respond to ADH, the condition is called nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Nephrogenic means related to the kidney.\n\nCentral DI is rare. It can be caused by damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland as a result of:\n\n* Genetic problems\n* Head injury (common cause)\n* Infection in the brain\n* Problem with the ADH-producing cells due to an autoimmune disease\n\nLoss of blood supply to the pituitary gland\nSurgery in the area of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus (most common cause)\nTumors in or near the pituitary gland\n\nNephrogenic DI involves a defect in the kidneys. As a result, the kidneys do not respond to ADH. Nephrogenic DI is very rare. Nephrogenic DI may be caused by:\n\n* Certain medicines, such as lithium\n* Genetic problems\n* High level of calcium in the body (hypercalcemia)\n* Kidney disease, such as polycystic kidney disease\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of DI include:\n\n* Excessive thirst that may be intense or uncontrollable, usually with the need to drink large amounts of water or craving for ice water\n* Excessive urine volume\n* Excessive urination, often needing to urinate every hour throughout the day and night\n* Very dilute, pale urine\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes Insipidus**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nDiabetes insipidus (DI) is a rare disorder that affects the regulation of fluids in the body. It is characterized by an inability to regulate the amount of water in the body, leading to excessive thirst and urination.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of DI include:\n\n* **Excessive thirst**: A strong craving for ice water or other cold drinks\n* **Excessive urine volume**: Producing large amounts of very dilute, pale urine\n* **Frequent urination**: Needing to urinate every hour throughout the day and night\n\n**Causes**\n\nThere are two main types of DI:\n\n1. **Central DI**: Caused by a problem with the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, which regulates the amount of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in the body.\n2. **Nephrogenic DI**: Caused by a problem with the kidneys' ability to respond to ADH.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for DI depends on the underlying cause:\n\n* **Central DI**: May be controlled with vasopressin (desmopressin, DDAVP), which can be taken as an injection, nasal spray, or tablets.\n* **Nephrogenic DI**: If caused by a medicine, stopping the medicine may help restore normal kidney function. Hereditary nephrogenic DI and lithium-induced nephrogenic DI are treated by drinking enough fluids to match urine output.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nIf not treated properly, DI can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, which can be very dangerous. Drinking more fluids than needed can also cause a dangerous electrolyte imbalance if the body's thirst control is not normal.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of DI or if frequent urination or extreme thirst returns after treatment.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes Insipidus**\n\n**What is diabetes insipidus?**\n\nDiabetes insipidus (DI) is a rare disorder that affects the regulation of water balance in the body. It is characterized by an inability to regulate fluids, leading to excessive thirst and urination.\n\n**Causes of diabetes insipidus**\n\nThe causes of DI are varied and can be attributed to several factors:\n\n*   **Genetic predisposition**: Some people may be born with a genetic tendency to develop DI.\n*   **Infections or inflammation**: Certain infections or inflammatory conditions, such as meningitis or encephalitis, can damage the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, leading to DI.\n*   **Tumors or cysts**: Tumors or cysts in the hypothalamus or pituitary gland can disrupt hormone production and lead to DI.\n*   **Head trauma**: Severe head trauma can cause damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, resulting in DI.\n\n**Symptoms of diabetes insipidus**\n\nThe symptoms of DI can vary depending on the severity of the condition. Some common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Excessive thirst**: People with DI may experience an intense desire to drink water due to their body's inability to regulate fluids.\n*   **Frequent urination**: DI can cause an individual to produce large amounts of diluted urine, leading to frequent trips to the bathroom.\n*   **Polyuria**: This is a condition characterized by the production of abnormally large volumes of urine.\n\n**Diagnosis and treatment of diabetes insipidus**\n\nDiagnosing DI typically involves a combination of physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests. Treatment options may include:\n\n*   **Hormone replacement therapy**: In some cases, hormone replacement therapy may be necessary to replace missing hormones.\n*   **Fluid management**: Managing fluid intake and output is crucial in managing DI.\n*   **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgery may be required to remove a tumor or cyst.\n\n**Prognosis of diabetes insipidus**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with DI varies depending on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. With proper treatment and management, many people with DI can lead normal lives.",

    "content": "**Diabetes Myths and Facts**\n\nDiabetes is a long-term (chronic) disease in which the body cannot regulate the amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Diabetes is a complicated disease. If you have diabetes, or know anyone who has it, you may have questions about the disease. There are many popular myths about diabetes and its management. Here are some facts you should know about diabetes.\n\n**Information**\n\n*   **Myth:** No one in my family has diabetes, so I won't get the disease.\n    *   **Fact:** It's true that having a parent or sibling with diabetes increases your risk for getting diabetes. In fact, family history is a risk factor for both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. However, many people with diabetes have no close family members with diabetes.\n\n**Lifestyle Choices**\n\n*   Being overweight or obese\n*   Having prediabetes\n*   Polycystic ovary disease\n*   Gestational diabetes\n*   Being of Hispanic/Latino American, African American, American Indian, or Alaska Native descent (some Pacific Islanders and Asian Americans are also at risk)\n*   Being age 45 or older\n\nYou can help reduce your risk by staying at a healthy weight, exercising most days of the week, and eating a healthy diet.\n\n**Myth-Busting**\n\n*   **Myth:** I will likely develop diabetes because I am overweight.\n    *   **Fact:** It is true that excess weight increases your chance of having diabetes. However, many people who are overweight or obese never develop diabetes. And people who are normal weight or only a little overweight do develop diabetes. Your best bet is to take steps to lower your risk by using nutritional changes and physical activity to lose excess weight.\n*   **Myth:** I eat a lot of sugar, so I am worried I'll get diabetes.\n    *   **Fact:** Eating sugar does not cause diabetes. But you should still cut back on sweets and sugary beverages.\n*   **Myth:** I was told I have diabetes, so now I'll have to eat a special diet.\n    *   **Fact:** People with diabetes eat the same foods that everyone eats. In fact, The American Diabetes Association no longer recommends specific amounts of carbohydrate, fat, or protein to eat. But they do suggest that people with diabetes get their carbohydrates from vegetables, whole grains, fruits, and legumes. Avoid foods that are high in fat, sodium, and sugar.\n*   **Myth:** I have diabetes, so I can never eat sweets.\n    *   **Fact:** Sweets are full of simple sugars, which increase the amount of glucose in your blood more than other foods. But they are not off limits for people with diabetes, as long as you plan for them. It's best to save sweets for special occasions or as a treat.\n*   **Myth:** My provider put me on insulin. This means I am not doing a good job managing my blood sugar.\n    *   **Fact:** People with type 1 diabetes must use insulin because their body no longer produces this important hormone. Type 2 diabetes is progressive, which means that the body makes less insulin over time. So over time, exercise, diet changes, and oral medicines or non-insulin injectable medicines may not be enough to keep your blood sugar in control. Then you need to use insulin to keep blood sugar in a healthy range.\n*   **Myth:** It is not safe to exercise with diabetes.\n    *   **Fact:** Getting regular exercise is an important part of managing diabetes. Exercise helps boost your body's sensitivity to insulin. It can also help lower your A1C, a test that helps tell how well your diabetes is controlled.\n*   **Myth:** I have borderline diabetes, so I don't need to worry.\n    *   **Fact:** Prediabetes is the term used for those whose blood sugar levels are not in the diabetes range but are too high to be called normal. Prediabetes means that you are at high risk for developing diabetes within 10 years. You may be able to lower your blood sugar to normal levels by lowering your body weight and exercising 150 minutes a week.\n*   **Myth:** I can stop taking diabetes medicines once my blood sugar is under control.\n    *   **Fact:** Some people with type 2 diabetes are able to control their blood sugar without medicine by losing weight, eating a healthy diet, and getting regular exercise. But diabetes is a progressive disease, and over time, even if you are doing all you can to stay healthy, you may need medicine to keep your blood sugar within your target range.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.

This confusion may come from the fact that when you eat food, it is converted into a sugar called glucose. Glucose, also called blood sugar, is a source of energy for the body. Insulin moves glucose from the blood into the cells so it can be used for energy. With diabetes, the body does not make enough insulin, or the body does not use insulin well. As a result, the extra sugar stays in the blood, so the blood glucose (blood sugar) level increases.\n\nFor people who do not have diabetes, the main problem with eating a lot of sugar and drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is that it can make you overweight. And being overweight does increase your risk for diabetes.\n\n**Myth: I was told I have diabetes, so now I'll have to eat a special diet.**\n\nFact: People with diabetes eat the same foods that everyone eats.

Include two sessions a week of strength training as part of your exercise routine. If you haven't exercised in a while, walking at a brisk pace (you can talk, but not sing) is a great way to slowly build your fitness.\n\nTalk to your provider to make sure your exercise program is safe for you. Depending on how well-controlled your diabetes is, you will need to prevent and monitor for problems with your eyes, heart, and feet. Also, learn how to take your medicines when you exercise or how to adjust the dosage of medicines, such as insulin, to prevent low blood sugar.\n\n**Myth: I have borderline diabetes, so I don't need to worry.**\n\nFact: Prediabetes is the term used for those whose blood sugar levels are not in the diabetes range but are too high to be called normal.

As a result, the extra sugar stays in the blood, so the blood glucose (blood sugar) level increases.\n\nFor people who do not have diabetes, the main problem with eating a lot of sugar and drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is that it can make you overweight. And being overweight does increase your risk for diabetes.\n\n**Myth: I was told I have diabetes, so now I'll have to eat a special diet.**\n\nFact: People with diabetes eat the same foods that everyone eats. In fact, The American Diabetes Association no longer recommends specific amounts of carbohydrate, fat, or protein to eat. But they do suggest that people with diabetes get their carbohydrates from vegetables, whole grains, fruits, and legumes. Avoid foods that are high in fat, sodium, and sugar. These recommendations are similar to what everyone should be eating.\n\nIf you have diabetes, work with your health care provider to develop a meal plan that works best for you and that you will be able to follow consistently over time. A healthy and balanced meal plan with a healthy lifestyle will help you manage diabetes.\n\n**Myth: I have diabetes, so I can never eat sweets.**\n\nFact: Sweets are full of simple sugars, which increase the amount of glucose in your blood more than other foods. But they are not off limits for people with diabetes, as long as you plan for them. It's best to save sweets for special occasions or as a treat. You can eat small amounts of sugar in place of other carbohydrates usually eaten at a meal. If you take insulin your provider may instruct you to take higher doses than normal when you do eat sweets.\n\n**Myth: My provider put me on insulin. This means I am not doing a good job managing my blood sugar.**\n\nFact: People with type 1 diabetes must use insulin because their body no longer produces this important hormone. Type 2 diabetes is progressive, which means that the body makes less insulin over time. So over time, exercise, diet changes, and oral medicines or non-insulin injectable medicines may not be enough to keep your blood sugar in control. Then you need to use insulin to keep blood sugar in a healthy range.\n\n**Myth: It is not safe to exercise with diabetes.**\n\nFact: Getting regular exercise is an important part of managing diabetes. Exercise helps boost your body's sensitivity to insulin. It can also help lower your A1C, a test that helps tell how well your diabetes is controlled.\n\nA good goal is to aim for at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous exercise like brisk walking. Include two sessions a week of strength training as part of your exercise routine. If you haven't exercised in a while, walking at a brisk pace (you can talk, but not sing) is a great way to slowly build your fitness.\n\nTalk to your provider to make sure your exercise program is safe for you. Depending on how well-controlled your diabetes is, you will need to prevent and monitor for problems with your eyes, heart, and feet. Also, learn how to take your medicines when you exercise or how to adjust the dosage of medicines, such as insulin, to prevent low blood sugar.\n\n**Myth: I have borderline diabetes, so I don't need to worry.**\n\nFact: Prediabetes is the term used for those whose blood sugar levels are not in the diabetes range but are too high to be called normal. Prediabetes means that you are at high risk for developing diabetes within 10 years. You may be able to lower your blood sugar to normal levels by lowering your body weight and exercising 150 minutes a week.\n\nTalk to your provider about your risk for diabetes and what you can do to lower your risk.\n\n**Myth: I can stop taking diabetes medicines once my blood sugar is under control.**\n\nFact: Some people with type 2 diabetes are able to control their blood sugar without medicine by losing weight, eating a healthy diet, and getting regular exercise. But diabetes is a progressive disease, and over time, even if you are doing all you can to stay healthy, you may need medicine to keep your blood sugar within your target range.\n\n**Myth: No one in my family has diabetes, so I won't get the disease.**\n\nFact: It's true that having a parent or sibling with diabetes increases your risk for getting diabetes. In fact, family history is a risk factor for both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. However, many people with diabetes have no close family members with diabetes.\n\nLifestyle choices and certain conditions can increase your risk for type 2 diabetes. These include:\n\n*   Being overweight or obese\n*   Physical inactivity\n*   High blood pressure\n*   High cholesterol\n*   Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\n*   Certain ethnicities, such as African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, American Indians, and some Asian Americans\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes Myths and Facts**\n\nManaging diabetes is not about depriving yourself of sweets, but about planning for them. Sweets are full of simple sugars that increase blood glucose levels more than other foods. People with diabetes can eat small amounts of sugar in place of other carbohydrates, but it's best to save sweets for special occasions or as a treat.\n\n**Myth: I have diabetes, so I can never eat sweets.**\n\n*Fact*: Sweets are not off-limits for people with diabetes, as long as you plan for them. If you take insulin, your provider may instruct you to take higher doses than normal when you do eat sweets.\n\n**Myth: My provider put me on insulin. This means I am not doing a good job managing my blood sugar.**\n\n*Fact*: People with type 1 diabetes must use insulin because their body no longer produces this important hormone. Type 2 diabetes is progressive, meaning that the body makes less insulin over time. As the disease progresses, exercise, diet changes, and oral medicines or non-insulin injectable medicines may not be enough to keep blood sugar in control, requiring insulin to maintain a healthy range.\n\n**Myth: It is not safe to exercise with diabetes.**\n\n*Fact*: Getting regular exercise is an important part of managing diabetes. Exercise helps boost your body's sensitivity to insulin and can lower your A1C levels. Aim for at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous exercise, such as brisk walking, and include two sessions a week of strength training.\n\n**Myth: I have borderline diabetes, so I don't need to worry.**\n\n*Fact*: Prediabetes is the term used for those whose blood sugar levels are not in the diabetes range but are too high to be called normal.

    "content": "**Diabetes Tests and Checkups**\n\nPeople who take control of their own diabetes care by eating healthy foods, living an active lifestyle, and taking medicines as prescribed often have good control of their blood sugar levels. Still, regular health checkups and tests are needed. These visits give you a chance to:\n\n*   Ask your health care provider questions\n*   Learn more about your diabetes and what you can do to keep your blood sugar in your target range\n*   Make sure you are taking your medicines the right way\n\n**Regular Checkups**\n\nSee your diabetes provider every 3 to 6 months. During this visit, your provider should check your:\n\n*   Blood pressure\n*   Weight\n*   Feet\n\nSee your dentist every 6 months, also.\n\nIf you are taking insulin or other injections, your provider will also examine your skin to look for signs of reactions to insulin at your injection sites. These may be hard areas or areas where fat under the skin has formed a lump.\n\nYour provider may also check your abdomen for signs of an enlarged liver.\n\n**Eye Exams**\n\nAn eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) should check your eyes every year. See an eye doctor who takes care of people with diabetes.\n\nIf you have eye problems because of diabetes, you will probably see your eye doctor more often.\n\n**Foot Exams**\n\nYour provider should check the pulses in your feet and your reflexes at least once a year. Your provider should also look for:\n\n*   Calluses\n*   Infections\n*   Sores\n*   Thick toenails\n*   Loss of feeling anywhere in your feet (peripheral neuropathy), done with a tool called a monofilament\n\nIf you have had foot ulcers before, see your provider every 3 to 6 months. It is always a good idea to ask your provider to check your feet.\n\n**Hemoglobin A1C Tests**\n\nAn A1C lab test shows how well you are controlling your blood sugar levels over a 3-month period.\n\nThe normal level is less than 5.7%. Most people with diabetes should aim for an A1C of less than 7%. Some people have a higher target. Your provider will help decide what your target should be.\n\nHigher A1C numbers mean that your blood sugar is higher and that you may be more likely to have complications from your diabetes.\n\n**Cholesterol**\n\nA cholesterol profile test measures cholesterol and triglycerides in your blood. You should have this kind of test in the morning, after not eating since the night before.\n\nMost adults with type 2 diabetes should have this test once a year. People age 40 or over with high cholesterol or on medicines to control their cholesterol may have this test more often.\n\n**Blood Pressure**\n\nBlood pressure should be measured at every visit. Talk to your provider about what your blood pressure goal should be.\n\n**Kidney Tests**\n\nOnce a year, you should have a urine test that looks for a protein called albumin.\n\nYour provider will also have you take a blood test every year that measures how well your kidneys work.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes Tests and Checkups**\n\nPeople who take control of their own diabetes care by eating healthy foods, living an active lifestyle, and taking medicines as prescribed often have good control of their blood sugar levels.

    "content": "**Diabetes Type 2 - Meal Planning**\n\nWhen you have type 2 diabetes, taking time to plan your meals goes a long way toward controlling your blood sugar (glucose) and weight.\n\n**Function**\n\nYour main focus is on keeping your blood sugar level in your target range. To help manage your blood sugar, follow a meal plan that has:\n\n* Food from all the food groups\n* Fewer calories\n* About the same amount of carbohydrates at each meal and snack\n* Healthy fats\n\nAlong with healthy eating, you can help keep your blood sugar in target range by maintaining a healthy weight. People with type 2 diabetes are often overweight or obese. Losing even 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) can help you manage your diabetes better. Eating healthy foods and staying active (for example, 150 total minutes of walking or other activity per week) can help you meet and maintain your weight loss goal. Activity lets your muscles use sugar from the blood without needing insulin to move the sugar into the muscle cells.\n\n**HOW CARBOHYDRATES AFFECT BLOOD SUGAR**\n\nCarbohydrates in food give your body energy. You need to eat carbohydrates to maintain your energy. But carbohydrates also raise your blood sugar higher and faster than other kinds of food.\n\nThe main kinds of carbohydrates are starches, sugars, and fiber. Learn which foods have carbohydrates. This will help with meal planning so that you can keep your blood sugar in your target range. Not all carbohydrates can be broken down and absorbed by your body. Foods with more non-digestible carbohydrates, or fiber, are less likely to increase your blood sugar out of your goal range. These include foods such as beans and whole grains.\n\n**MEAL PLANNING FOR CHILDREN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES**\n\nMeal plans should consider the amount of calories children need to grow. In general, three small meals and three snacks a day can help meet calorie needs. Many children with type 2 diabetes are overweight. The goal should be able to reach a healthy weight by eating healthy foods and getting more activity (60 minutes per day).\n\nWork with a registered dietitian to design a meal plan for your child. A registered dietitian is an expert in food and nutrition.\n\nThe following tips can help your child stay on track:\n\n* No food is off-limits. Knowing how different foods affect your child's blood sugar helps you and your child keep blood sugar in target range.\n* Help your child learn how much food is a healthy amount. This is called portion control.\n* Have your family gradually switch from drinking soda and other sugary drinks, such as sports drinks and juices, to plain water or low-fat milk.\n\n**PLANNING MEALS**\n\nEveryone has individual needs. Work with your health care provider, registered dietitian, or diabetes educator to develop a meal plan that works for you.\n\nWhen shopping, read food labels to make better food choices.\n\nA good way to make sure you get all the nutrients you need during meals is to use the plate method. This is a visual food guide that helps you choose the best types and right amounts of food to eat. It encourages larger portions of non-starchy vegetables (half the plate) and moderate portions of protein (one quarter of the plate) and starch (one quarter of the plate).\n\n**EAT A VARIETY OF FOODS**\n\nEating a wide variety of foods helps you stay healthy. Try to include foods from all the food groups at each meal.\n\n* **VEGETABLES**\n\t+ Choose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt.\n\t+ Non-starchy vegetables include dark green and deep yellow vegetables, such as cucumber, spinach, broccoli, romaine lettuce, cabbage, chard, and bell peppers.\n\t+ Starchy vegetables include corn, green peas, lima beans, carrots, yams and taro. Note that potato should be considered a pure starch, like white bread or white rice, instead of a vegetable.\n* **FRUITS**\n\t+ Choose fresh, frozen, canned (without added sugar or syrup), or unsweetened dried fruits.\n\t+ Try apples, bananas, berries, cherries, fruit cocktail, grapes, melon, oranges, peaches, pears, papaya, pineapple, and raisins.\n* **GRAINS**\n\t+ There are 2 types of grains:\n\t\t- Whole grains are unprocessed and have the entire grain kernel. Examples are whole-wheat flour, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, amaranth, barley, brown and wild rice, buckwheat, and quinoa.\n\t\t- Refined grains have been processed (milled) to remove the bran and germ. Examples are white flour, de-germed cornmeal, white bread, and white rice.\n* **PROTEIN FOODS**\n\t+ Protein foods include meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, beans and peas, nuts, seeds, and processed soy foods.\n\t+ Eat fish and poultry more often. Remove the skin from chicken and turkey. Select lean cuts of beef, veal, pork, or wild game. Trim all visible fat from meat. Bake, roast, broil, grill, or boil instead of frying.\n* **DAIRY**\n\t+ Choose low-fat dairy products.\n\t+ Be aware that milk, yogurt, and other dairy foods have natural sugar, even when they do not contain added sugar.\n* **OILS/FATS**\n\t+ Limit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat, such as hamburgers, deep-fried foods, bacon, and butter.\n\n**WHAT ABOUT ALCOHOL AND SWEETS?**\n\nIf you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount and have it with a meal. Check with your provider about how alcohol will affect your blood sugar and to determine a safe amount for you.\n\nSweets are high in fat and sugar. Keep portion sizes small.\n\nHere are tips to help avoid eating too many sweets:\n\n* Ask for extra spoons and forks and split your dessert with others.\n* Eat sweets that are sugar-free.\n* Always ask for the smallest serving size or children's size.\n\n**YOUR DIABETES CARE TEAM IS THERE TO HELP YOU**\n\nIn the beginning, meal planning may be overwhelming. But it will become easier as your knowledge grows about foods and their effects on your blood sugar. If you're having problems with meal planning, talk with your diabetes care team. They are there to help you.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes Type 2 - Meal Planning**\n\nWhen you have type 2 diabetes, taking time to plan your meals goes a long way toward controlling your blood sugar (glucose) and weight.\n\n**Function**\n\nYour main focus is on keeping your blood sugar level in your target range.

Non-starchy vegetables include dark green and deep yellow vegetables, such as cucumber, spinach, broccoli, romaine lettuce, cabbage, chard, and bell peppers.\n* **Fruits**: Choose fresh, frozen, canned (without added sugar or syrup), or unsweetened dried fruits. Try apples, bananas, berries, cherries, fruit cocktail, grapes, melon, oranges, peaches, pears, papaya, pineapple, and raisins.\n* **Grains**: There are 2 types of grains: whole grains and refined grains. Choose whole grains, such as brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat bread, and whole grain pasta.\n\n**Tips to Help Avoid Eating Too Many Sweets**\n\nIf you choose to eat sweets, keep portion sizes small. Here are some tips:\n\n* Ask for extra spoons and forks and split your dessert with others.\n* Eat sweets that are sugar-free.\n* Always ask for the smallest serving size or children's size.\n\n**Your Diabetes Care Team is There to Help You**\n\nIn the beginning, meal planning may be overwhelming. But it will become easier as your knowledge grows about foods and their effects on your blood sugar. If you're having problems with meal planning, talk with your diabetes care team. They are there to help you.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes Type 2 - Meal Planning**\n\nAs a person with type 2 diabetes, managing your blood sugar level is crucial for maintaining good health. A well-planned meal can help you achieve this goal.\n\n**Food Groups**\n\nA healthy diet should include food from all the food groups:\n\n* **Vegetables**: Choose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt. Aim for 2 to 3 cups (360 to 550 grams) per day for women and 2½ to 4 cups (450 to 720 grams) per day for men with the lower end for those age 60 or older.\n* **Fruits**: Choose fresh, frozen, canned (without added sugar or syrup), or unsweetened dried fruits. Aim for 1½ to 2 cups (240 to 320 grams) per day for women and 2 to 2½ cups (320 to 400 grams) per day for men with the lower end for those age 60 or older.\n* **Grains**: Whole grains are unprocessed and have the entire grain kernel. Examples include whole-wheat flour, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, amaranth, barley, brown and wild rice, buckwheat, and quinoa. Refined grains have been processed (milled) to remove the bran and germ. Aim for 5 to 8 ounces (135 to 216 grams) per day for women and 6 to 10 ounces (162 to 270 grams) per day for men with the lower end for those age 60 or older.\n* **Protein Foods**: Include meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, beans and peas, nuts, seeds, and processed soy foods. Aim for 5 to 6½ oz (140 to 182 grams) per day for women and 5½ to 7 oz (154 to 196 grams) per day for men with the lower end for those age 60 or older.\n* **Dairy**: Choose low-fat dairy products. Be aware that milk, yogurt, and other dairy foods have natural sugar, even when they do not contain added sugar.\n\n**Healthy Eating Tips**\n\nTo manage your blood sugar level, follow these healthy eating tips:\n\n* Eat a variety of foods from all the food groups.\n* Limit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat.\n* Choose foods that are high in polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats.\n* Use no more than 7 teaspoons (35 milliliters) of oils per day.\n* If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount and have it with a meal.\n\n**Meal Planning for Children**\n\nChildren with type 2 diabetes need a balanced diet that meets their calorie needs. Work with a registered dietitian to design a meal plan that includes three small meals and three snacks a day. Aim for children to reach a healthy weight by eating healthy foods and getting more activity (60 minutes per day).\n\n**Planning Meals**\n\nEveryone has individual needs. Work with your health care provider, registered dietitian, or diabetes educator to develop a meal plan that works for you. When shopping, read food labels to make better food choices.\n\n**Eat a Variety of Foods**\n\nEating a wide variety of foods helps you stay healthy. Try to include foods from all the food groups at each meal.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes Type 2 - Meal Planning**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Grains and Fiber**\n\nWhole grains, such as brown rice, wild rice, buckwheat, quinoa, and whole wheat bread, are rich in fiber. Fiber helps slow down the digestion of carbohydrates, preventing a sudden spike in blood sugar levels.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Protein Foods**\n\nAim for 5 to 6½ oz (140 to 182 g) of protein foods per day for women and 5½ to 7 oz (154 to 196 g) per day for men. Include lean cuts of meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, beans, peas, nuts, seeds, and processed soy foods in your diet.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Dairy**\n\nChoose low-fat dairy products, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese. Be aware that dairy foods contain natural sugar, which can affect blood sugar levels. Some non-fat dairy products may have added sugars, so read labels carefully.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Oils and Fats**\n\nLimit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat. Instead, choose polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats found in fish, nuts, and vegetable oils. Oils can raise blood sugar levels, but not as quickly as starch.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Alcohol and Sweets**\n\nIf you drink alcohol, limit the amount and have it with a meal. Check with your healthcare provider about safe consumption levels. When consuming sweets, keep portion sizes small and consider alternatives like sugar-free desserts or splitting treats with others.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Healthy Eating Tips**\n\n*   Eat a variety of foods from all food groups at each meal.\n*   Choose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt.\n*   Include non-starchy vegetables like dark green and deep yellow vegetables in your diet.\n*   Select whole grains over refined grains to increase fiber intake.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Meal Planning for Children**\n\nDevelop a meal plan that meets the calorie needs of children with type 2 diabetes. Aim for three small meals and three snacks per day. Work with a registered dietitian to design a personalized meal plan.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Plate Method**\n\nUse the plate method as a visual food guide to ensure you get all the necessary nutrients during meals. Divide your plate into:\n\n*   Half: non-starchy vegetables\n*   One quarter: protein foods\n*   One quarter: starch or whole grains\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes Type 2 - Meal Planning**\n\nWhen planning meals, it's essential to consider the natural sugar content of foods, even if they don't contain added sugar. Take this into account when staying within your blood sugar target range.\n\n**OILS/FATS (no more than 7 teaspoons or 35 milliliters a day)**\n\n* Oils are not considered a food group but have nutrients that help your body stay healthy.\n* Limit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat, such as hamburgers, deep-fried foods, bacon, and butter.\n* Choose foods high in polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats, like fish, nuts, and vegetable oils.\n\n**WHAT ABOUT ALCOHOL AND SWEETS?**\n\n* If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount and have it with a meal. Check with your provider about how alcohol will affect your blood sugar.\n* Sweets are high in fat and sugar; keep portion sizes small.\n\n**TIPS TO AVOID EATING TOO MANY SWEETS:**\n\n* Read food labels carefully.\n* Choose complex carbohydrates over simple ones.\n* Limit saturated fats.\n\n**YOUR DIABETES CARE TEAM IS THERE TO HELP YOU**\n\nIn the beginning, meal planning may be overwhelming. But it will become easier as your knowledge grows about foods and their effects on your blood sugar. If you're having problems with meal planning, talk with your diabetes care team.

    "content": "**Diabetes**\n\nAlso called: Diabetes mellitus, DM\n\n**Basics**\n\nSummary\nStart Here\n\n**What is diabetes?**\n\nDiabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose is your body's main source of energy. Your body can make glucose, but it also comes from the food you eat. Insulin is a hormone made by your pancreas. Insulin helps move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells, where it can be used for energy.\n\nIf you have diabetes, your body can't make insulin, can't use insulin as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. This can cause glucose levels to get too high. Over time, high blood glucose levels can lead to serious health conditions. But you can take steps to manage your diabetes and try to prevent these health problems.\n\n**Types of Diabetes**\n\nThere are different types of diabetes:\n\n* **Type 1 diabetes**: If you have type 1 diabetes, your body makes little or no insulin. It happens when your immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin.\n* **Type 2 diabetes**: This is the most common form of diabetes. If you have type 2 diabetes, your body may still be able to make insulin, but your cells don't respond well to insulin. They can't easily take up enough glucose from your blood.\n* **Gestational diabetes**: This is a form of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. It happens when your body can't make the extra insulin it needs during pregnancy.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe different types of diabetes have different causes:\n\n* Researchers think type 1 diabetes is caused by genes and factors in the environment that might trigger the disease.\n* Type 2 diabetes is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes. The lifestyle factors include not being physically active and being overweight or having obesity.\n* Researchers think gestational diabetes is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors.\n\nYou can develop type 1 diabetes at any age, but it most often starts in childhood. Having a parent or sibling with type 1 diabetes may increase your chance of developing it.\n\nYou are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you:\n\n* Are overweight or have obesity.\n* Are over age 35. Children, teenagers, and younger adults can get diabetes, but it is more common in middle-aged and older adults.\n* Have a family history of diabetes.\n* Have prediabetes. This means that your blood glucose is higher than normal, but it's not high enough to be called diabetes.\n* Had gestational diabetes.\n* Have given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more.\n* Are African American, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander.\n* Are not physically active.\n* Have certain other health conditions, such as high blood pressure or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).\n\nYou are at higher risk of developing gestational diabetes if you:\n\n* Are overweight or have obesity.\n* Have a family history of diabetes.\n* Had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy.\n* Have given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more.\n* Have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).\n* Are African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander.\n\n**Symptoms of Diabetes**\n\nThe symptoms of diabetes may include:\n\n* Feeling very thirsty\n* Feeling very hungry\n* Urinating (peeing) more often, including at night\n* Fatigue\n* Blurry vision\n* Numbness or tingling in the feet or hands\n* Sores that do not heal\n* Losing weight without trying\n\nBut it's important to know that your symptoms may vary, depending on which type you have:\n\n* The symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually come on quickly and can be severe.\n* With type 2 diabetes, the symptoms often develop slowly, over several years. The symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them.\n* Gestational diabetes often has no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they may be mild. If you are pregnant, you will usually be screened for this condition between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nTo find out if you have diabetes, your health care provider will use one or more glucose blood tests. There are several types, including the A1C test.\n\n**Treatments**\n\nTreatment for diabetes involves managing your blood glucose levels:\n\n* If you have type 1 diabetes, you will need to take daily doses of insulin, either by injection or through a special pump. Some people also need to take another type of diabetes medicine that works with insulin.\n* If you have type 2 diabetes, you may be able to manage or even reverse it by making lifestyle changes. These include eating a healthy diet, staying at healthy weight, and getting regular physical activity. Some people also need to take diabetes medicines to manage their diabetes.\n* If you have gestational diabetes, you may be able to lower your glucose levels by eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise. But be sure to talk to your provider about your treatment options. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after you give birth. But you will have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.\n\nChecking your blood glucose levels is also an important part of managing your diabetes. Ask your provider about the best way to check your blood glucose level and how often you should check it.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nType 1 diabetes can't be prevented.\n\nYou may be able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes through the same lifestyle changes that are used to manage diabetes (eating a healthy diet, staying at a healthy weight, and getting regular physical activity). These lifestyle changes may also help prevent gestational diabetes.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes**\n\nDiabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high.

    "content": "**Diabetes**\n\nDiabetes is a long-term (chronic) disease in which the body cannot regulate the amount of sugar in the blood.\n\n**Causes**\n\nInsulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to the action of insulin, or both.\n\nTo understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested and absorbed:\n\n*   A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.\n*   An organ in the upper abdomen, below and behind the stomach, called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and other cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel.\n\nPeople with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either:\n\n*   Their pancreas does not make enough insulin\n*   Their cells do not respond to insulin normally (also called insulin resistance)\n*   Both of the above\n\nThere are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type:\n\n**Type 1 Diabetes**\n\nType 1 diabetes is less common, accounting for 5% to 10% of people with diabetes in the United States. It can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin are damaged by an immune process and stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause of the immune process is unknown.\n\n**Type 2 Diabetes**\n\nType 2 diabetes is more common, accounting for 90% to 95% of people with diabetes in the United States. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should. Not all people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese.\n\n**Other Causes of Diabetes**\n\nThere are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. Examples include LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, a variant of type 1 diabetes), MODY (maturity-onset diabetes of the young), and diabetes due to other illnesses.\n\n**Gestational Diabetes**\n\nGestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not already have diabetes.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nIf your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you are more likely to develop the disease.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA high blood sugar level can cause several symptoms, including:\n\n*   Blurry vision\n*   Excess thirst\n*   Fatigue\n*   Frequent urination\n*   Hunger\n*   Weight loss\n\nBecause type 2 diabetes develops slowly, some people with high blood sugar have no symptoms.\n\nSymptoms of type 1 diabetes typically develop over a short period, usually weeks to months. People may be very sick by the time they are diagnosed.\n\n**Diabetes Complications**\n\nAfter many years, diabetes can lead to other serious problems. These problems are known as diabetes complications, and include:\n\n*   Eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), light sensitivity, cataracts, and blindness\n*   Sores and infections of the leg or foot, which if untreated, can lead to amputation of the leg or foot\n*   Damage to nerves in the body, causing pain, tingling, a loss of feeling, problems digesting food, and erectile dysfunction\n*   Kidney problems, which can lead to kidney failure\n*   Weakened immune system, which can lead to more frequent infections\n*   Increased chance of having a heart attack or stroke\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA urine analysis may show high urine sugar. But a urine test alone does not diagnose diabetes.\n\nYour health care provider may suspect that you have diabetes if your blood sugar level is 200 mg/dL or higher (11.1 mmol/L). To confirm the diagnosis, one or more of the following tests must be done.\n\nBlood tests:\n\n*   Fasting blood glucose level. Diabetes is diagnosed if the fasting glucose level is 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or higher on two different tests, when the person is in their usual state of health. Levels from 100 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L to 7.0 mmol/L) are called impaired fasting glucose or prediabetes. These levels are risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes.\n*   Hemoglobin A1C (A1C) test. Normal is less than 5.7%; prediabetes is 5.7% to 6.4%; and diabetes is 6.5% or higher.\n*   Oral glucose tolerance test. Diabetes is diagnosed if the glucose level is 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher 2 hours after drinking a special 75 gram sugar drink (this test is used most often for type 2 diabetes and is rarely needed for type 1 diabetes).\n\n**Screening**\n\nScreening for type 2 diabetes in people who have no symptoms is recommended for:\n\n*   Overweight or obese adults (BMI of 25 kilograms per square meter or higher) starting at age 35 repeated every 3 years\n*   Overweight women who have other risk factors such as high blood pressure who are planning to become pregnant\n*   All adults age 35 or older, repeated every 3 years or at a younger age if the person has risk factors such as high blood pressure, or having a mother, father, sister, or brother with diabetes\n\n**Treatment**\n\nType 2 diabetes can sometimes be reversed with lifestyle changes, especially losing weight with exercise and by eating different foods. Some cases of type 2 diabetes can also be improved with weight loss surgery.\n\nThere is no cure for type 1 diabetes (except for a pancreas or islet cell transplant).\n\nTreating either type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes involves nutrition, activity and medicines to control blood sugar level.\n\nEveryone with diabetes should receive proper education and support about the best ways to manage their diabetes. Ask your provider about seeing a certified diabetes care and education specialist (CDCES).\n\nGetting better control over your blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels helps reduce the risk for kidney disease, eye disease, nervous system disease, heart attack, and stroke.\n\nTo minimize diabetes complications, visit your provider at least 2 to 4 times a year. Talk about any problems you are having. Follow your provider's instructions on managing your diabetes.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nMany resources can help you understand more about diabetes. If you have diabetes, you can also learn ways to manage your condition and prevent diabetes complications.\n\nMore information and support for people with diabetes and their families can be found at :\n\n*   American Diabetes Association -- www.diabetes.org\n*   National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases -- www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nDiabetes is a lifelong disease for most people who have it.\n\nTight control of blood glucose can prevent or delay diabetes complications. But these problems can occur, even in people with good diabetes control.\n\nPossible Complications\n\nAfter many years, diabetes can lead to serious health problems:\n\nThis cleaned output should now be displayed as intended.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetes**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nInsulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar.

If you're overweight, losing just 5% of your body weight can reduce your risk. Some medicines can also be used to delay or prevent the start of type 2 diabetes.\n\nAt this time, type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented.

There are several types of diabetes, including type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes.\n\n**Types of Diabetes**\n\n*   **Type 1 Diabetes**: An autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin.\n*   **Type 2 Diabetes**: A condition in which the body becomes resistant to insulin, making it harder for glucose to enter the cells.\n*   **Gestational Diabetes**: A type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy.\n\n**Symptoms of Diabetes**\n\nThe symptoms of diabetes can vary depending on the type and severity of the condition. Some common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Increased Urination**: When the body produces excess glucose, it can lead to an increase in urine production.\n*   **Fatigue**: High blood sugar levels can cause fatigue, weakness, and a general feeling of being unwell.\n*   **Blurred Vision**: High blood sugar levels can damage the nerves that control the eyes, leading to blurred vision.\n*   **Slow Healing of Cuts and Wounds**: Diabetes can impair the body's ability to heal wounds, making them take longer to heal.\n\n**Diagnosis of Diabetes**\n\nDiabetes is typically diagnosed through a combination of physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests. Some common tests used to diagnose diabetes include:\n\n*   **Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) Test**: A test that measures the level of glucose in the blood after an overnight fast.\n*   **Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)**: A test that measures the body's response to a sugary drink.\n*   **Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Test**: A test that measures the average level of glucose in the blood over the past 2-3 months.\n\n**Treatment of Diabetes**\n\nThe treatment of diabetes depends on the type and severity of the condition. Some common treatments include:\n\n*   **Lifestyle Changes**: Making healthy lifestyle changes, such as eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep.\n*   **Medications**: Taking medications to help lower blood sugar levels, improve insulin sensitivity, or reduce the risk of complications.\n*   **Insulin Therapy**: Using insulin injections or an insulin pump to deliver insulin directly into the bloodstream.\n\n**Prevention of Diabetes**\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent diabetes, there are some steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing the condition. Some common prevention strategies include:\n\n*   **Maintaining a Healthy Weight**: Being overweight or obese can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n*   **Eating a Balanced Diet**: Eating a diet that is high in whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and low in processed and sugary foods.\n*   **Exercising Regularly**: Engaging in regular physical activity, such as walking or jogging, can help improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of complications.\n\n**Screening for Diabetes**\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for diabetes in adults aged 40-70 who are overweight or obese. Screening should be done every 3 years using a fasting plasma glucose test or an oral glucose tolerance test.\n\n**Screening for Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes in Children and Adolescents**\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents who are overweight or obese. Screening should be done every 3 years using a fasting plasma glucose test or an oral glucose tolerance test.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Atkinson MA, McGill DE, Dassau E, Laffel L.

    "content": "**Diabetic Diet**\n\n**What is Diabetes?**\n\nIf you have diabetes, your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps glucose get into your cells.\n\nWith type 1 diabetes, your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood glucose levels.\n\n**How Do the Foods I Eat Affect My Blood Glucose Levels?**\n\nThe glucose in your blood comes from certain foods called carbohydrates, or \"carbs.\" Foods that are high in carbs include candy and sweets, sodas, breads, tortillas, and white rice. The more carbs you eat, the higher your blood glucose level will be.\n\n**What's the Best Diet for Diabetes?**\n\nThere isn't a specific diet or meal plan that works for everybody. Your health care provider may have you see a registered dietician (RD) or a diabetes educator who can help design the best eating plan for you.\n\n**What Foods Should I Eat if I Have Diabetes?**\n\nEating the right foods for diabetes means eating a variety of healthy foods from all the food groups:\n\n* Fruits and vegetables\n* Whole grains, such as whole wheat, brown rice, barley, quinoa, and oats\n* Proteins, such as lean meats, chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, nuts, beans, lentils, and tofu\n* Nonfat or low-fat dairy, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese\n\n**What Foods Should I Limit to Control My Blood Glucose?**\n\nTo keep your blood glucose under control, you may need to cut back on certain foods and drinks. This doesn't mean that you can never enjoy them. But you should have them less often or in smaller amounts.\n\nThe foods and drinks you should limit include:\n\n* High-carb foods and drinks, such as:\n\t+ Sugary foods, such as candy, cookies, cake, ice cream, sweetened cereals, and canned fruits with added sugar\n\t+ Drinks with added sugars, such as juice, regular soda, and regular sports or energy drinks\n\t+ White rice, tortillas, breads, and pasta - especially those made with white flour\n\t+ Starchy vegetables, such as white potatoes, corn, and peas\n\t+ Fried foods and other foods high in saturated and trans fats.\n\t+ Foods high in sodium (salt).\n\t+ Alcohol. If you do drink, you should drink moderately.\n\n**What Else Do I Need to Know About Diabetic Diets?**\n\nIf you have diabetes, it's important to eat the right amount of food every day. Your eating plan will include how much to eat, and help you choose the types of food for each meal or snack. If you take insulin, you may need to learn how to count carbs to help you know how much insulin to take.\n\nEating at the right times is also important. You will want to plan for regular, balanced meals to avoid blood glucose levels that are too high or too low for you. Eating about the same amount of carbs at each meal can be helpful.\n\nYour eating plan will also teach you how to stick with your plan at home and when you eat out.\n\n**Living With Diabetes**\n\n* Carb Counting (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n* Diabetes and Your Diet (American Heart Association)\n* What is the Diabetes Plate Method?

Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood glucose levels.\n\nThere are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. With type 1 diabetes, your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make or use insulin well.\n\n**Prediabetes**\n\nPrediabetes means that your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. If you have prediabetes, you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.\n\n**How Do Foods Affect Blood Glucose Levels?**\n\nThe glucose in your blood comes from certain foods called carbohydrates, or \"carbs.\" Foods that are high in carbs include candy and sweets, sodas, breads, tortillas, and white rice. The more carbs you eat, the higher your blood glucose level will be.\n\n**What's the Best Diet for Diabetes?**\n\nThere isn't a specific diet or meal plan that works for everybody.

A diabetic foot exam can help find problems that can lead to serious infection and amputation (surgery to remove all or part of your foot) if they're not found and treated early.\n\n**Why Do I Need a Diabetic Foot Exam?**\n\nPeople with diabetes usually need to have a complete diabetic foot exam at least once a year to help prevent serious infections. But if you've had foot problems from diabetes, you may need to have a complete foot exam more often.\n\n**What Happens During a Diabetic Foot Exam?**\n\nA complete diabetic foot exam usually includes these steps:\n\n*   Information about you: Your provider will ask questions about your medical history, the medicines you take, and your shoes.\n*   Skin exam: Your provider will check the skin of your feet to look for dryness, cracking, calluses, blisters, ulcers, and other damage or abnormal areas. They will also check your toenails for cracks and fungal infection.\n*   Nerve exam: Your provider will do a few tests to check your nerves and the feeling in your feet:\n    *   Monofilament test\n    *   Tuning fork and vibration perception threshold tests (VPT)\n    *   Pinprick test\n    *   Ankle reflexes\n*   Musculoskeletal (muscle and bone) exam: Your provider will look for problems such as bent or overlapping toes, bunions, and a rocker shape on the bottom of your foot (Charcot Foot).\n*   Vascular (blood vessel) exam: To check blood flow to your feet, your provider may feel the pulses in your foot and ankle and compare blood pressure measurements in your ankles and arms.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a diabetic foot exam.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetic Foot Exam**\n\nPeople with diabetes have a high risk for many types of foot health problems. A diabetic foot exam can help find problems that can lead to serious infection and amputation (surgery to remove all or part of your foot) if they're not found and treated early.\n\n**Why is it important?**\n\nDiabetic foot problems can happen over time if high blood glucose (blood sugar) damages the nerves and blood vessels in your feet. Nerve damage from diabetes is called diabetic neuropathy. It can make your feet feel numb or tingly. It can also cause you to lose feeling in your feet.\n\nIf you don't feel pain in your feet, you may not notice a callus, blister, or cut on your foot. Without treatment, these types of common foot wounds can become ulcers (open sores) that can get infected.\n\n**What happens during a diabetic foot exam?**\n\nA complete diabetic foot exam usually includes these steps:\n\n*   Information about you:\n    *   Your medical history\n    *   The medicines you take\n    *   Your shoes\n*   Skin exam:\n    *   Checking for problems with the nerves and blood flow\n    *   Signs of damage or injury\n    *   Changes in shape (such as bunions and hammer toes)\n\n**How often do I need a diabetic foot exam?**\n\nPeople with diabetes usually need to have a complete diabetic foot exam at least once a year to help prevent serious infections. But if you've had foot problems from diabetes, you may need to have a complete foot exam more often.\n\nA complete foot exam may be done by your primary care provider or a foot doctor (podiatrist). A foot doctor specializes in keeping feet healthy and treating foot diseases. Ask the provider you see for foot care to tell you how often you need a complete foot exam.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetic Foot Exam**\n\nAs part of your diabetic foot exam, your provider may check your shoes for proper fit and ask questions about your other footwear. Shoes that don't fit well can lead to blisters, calluses, and ulcers.\n\n**Skin Exam**\n\nYour provider will check:\n\n* The skin of your feet to look for dryness, cracking, calluses, blisters, ulcers, and other damage or abnormal areas\n* Your toenails for cracks and fungal infection\n* The temperature of your feet to see if they are the same\n\n**Nerve Exam**\n\nYour provider will do a few tests to check your nerves and the feeling in your feet:\n\n* Monofilament test. You will close your eyes while your provider brushes a soft strand of nylon (a monofilament) over your foot and toes. You'll tell your provider when you feel the strand touching your foot.\n* Tuning fork and vibration perception threshold tests (VPT). Your provider will place a tuning fork or other device that vibrates on different parts of your foot and toes to see if you can feel the vibrations.\n* Pinprick test. Your provider will gently press a small pin against your big toe to see if you can feel it. The pin will not break through your skin.\n* Ankle reflexes. Your provider will tap a special, small hammer on your Achilles tendon, the thick band of tissue that connects your calf muscle to your heel bone. If your nerves are working properly, your foot will jerk slightly on its own.\n\n**Musculoskeletal Exam**\n\nYour provider will look for problems such as:\n\n* Bent or overlapping toes\n* Bunions\n* A rocker shape on the bottom of your foot (Charcot Foot)\n\n**Vascular Exam**\n\nTo check blood flow to your feet, your provider may:\n\n* Feel the pulses in your foot and ankle\n* Compare blood pressure measurements in your ankles and arms. If blood pressure in your ankle is lower than in your arm, you may have reduced blood flow to your foot. This is called an ankle-brachial index test. Your provider may do this test if you have signs and symptoms of a blood flow problem.\n\n**Preparation**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a diabetic foot exam.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are no known risks to having a diabetic foot exam.\n\n**Results**\n\nYour provider will use the results of your exam to estimate your risk of developing foot ulcers and infections that could lead to amputation. If your risk is high, your provider will probably recommend that you have a complete diabetic foot exam more than once a year.\n\nIf a problem is found that needs medical care, your treatment will depend on the type of problem and how serious it is. If you have questions about your diabetic foot exam, ask your provider.\n\n**Self-Care**\n\nYou can help keep your feet healthy by:\n\n* Controlling your blood sugar levels every day\n* Checking your feet every day for cuts, redness, and other changes in the skin and toenails\n* Washing your feet every day with warm water and soap\n* Trimming your toenails straight across with a clipper\n* Always wearing well-fitting shoes and socks or slippers to protect your feet when walking\n* Protecting your feet from heat and cold\n* Keeping the blood flowing in your feet by putting them up when you're sitting, wiggling your toes, and getting plenty of activity that's not too hard on the feet.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetic Foot Exam**\n\nIt's good to have your provider look at your feet. You can help keep your feet healthy by controlling your blood sugar levels every day and taking good care of your feet.

Glucose comes from the foods you eat, and your cells need it for energy. A hormone called insulin helps get the glucose into your cells.\n\nWith type 1 diabetes, your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose can't get into your cells as quickly as usual, causing high blood sugar levels.\n\n**How Does Diabetes Cause Foot Problems?**\n\nFoot problems are common in people with diabetes. They can happen over time when high blood sugar damages the nerves and blood vessels in the feet. The nerve damage, called diabetic neuropathy, can cause numbness, tingling, pain, or a loss of feeling in your feet.\n\nIf you can't feel pain, you may not know when you have a cut, blister, or ulcer (open sore) on your foot. A wound like that could get infected. The infection may not heal well because the damaged blood vessels can cause poor blood flow in your feet.\n\nHaving an infection and poor blood flow can lead to gangrene. That means the muscle, skin, and other tissues start to die. If you have gangrene or a foot ulcer that does not get better with treatment, you may need an amputation. This is a surgery to cut off your damaged toe, foot, or part of your leg.\n\n**How Can I Protect My Feet if I Have Diabetes?**\n\nThe best way to protect your feet is by controlling your blood sugar levels every day. This will help keep nerve and blood vessel damage from getting worse. The next step is to keep the skin of your feet healthy.\n\nGood foot care for people with diabetes includes:\n\n* Checking your feet every day for cuts, redness, and other changes in the skin and toenails.\n* Washing your feet every day with warm water and soap.\n* Asking your doctor how to remove corns and calluses safely.\n* Trimming your toenails straight across with a clipper.\n* Always wearing well-fitting shoes and socks or slippers to protect your feet when walking.\n* Protecting your feet from heat and cold.\n* Keeping the blood flowing in your feet by putting them up when you're sitting, wiggling your toes, and circling your feet throughout the day.\n\n**When Should I See My Health Care Provider About Diabetic Foot Problems?**\n\nSerious foot problems can develop quickly. See your health care provider right away if you notice:\n\n* A cut, blister, or bruise on your feet that doesn't start to heal in a few days\n* Red, warm, or painful skin on your feet\n* A callus with dried blood inside\n* A foot infection that becomes black and smells bad that could be gangrene\n\n---\n\n**Diabetic Foot**\n\n**What is Diabetic Foot?**\n\nDiabetic foot is a serious complication of diabetes that can lead to amputation if left untreated.

The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.\n\nWith type 1 diabetes, your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood sugar levels.\n\n**What is Diabetic Heart Disease?**\n\nDiabetic heart disease is a term for heart disease in people who have diabetes. If you have diabetes, you are much more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke than people who don't have diabetes. And you may start having these problems at a younger age.\n\nOver time, the effects of high blood sugar from diabetes can include damage to the blood vessels and nerves in your heart. This damage increases your chance of developing heart diseases, including:\n\n*   **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)**: It happens slowly as a sticky material called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood.\n*   **Heart Failure**: With this condition, your heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet the needs of your body.\n*   **Cardiomyopathy**: This is a group of diseases in which the heart muscle may become thick or stiff.\n\n**Who is More Likely to Develop Diabetic Heart Disease?**\n\nDiabetes puts you at serious risk for heart disease. It also makes you more likely to develop other conditions that raise your risk even more, including:\n\n*   **High Blood Pressure**\n*   **High Blood Levels of LDL \"Bad\" Cholesterol**\n*   **High Triglycerides (a type of fat in your blood) with low blood levels of HDL \"good\" cholesterol**\n\nYour risk for heart disease is also higher if you\n\n*   Are male\n*   Smoke\n*   Have obesity\n*   Have too much belly fat around your waist, even though you're at a healthy weight:\n    *   For men, that's a waist more than 40 inches\n    *   For women, that's a waist more than 35 inches\n*   Have a family history of heart disease\n*   Have chronic kidney disease\n\n**How is Diabetic Heart Disease Diagnosed?**\n\nTo find out if you have diabetic heart disease, your provider will:\n\n*   Ask about your medical history, including your symptoms and other health conditions you may have\n*   Ask about your family history, to find out if you have relatives who have or had heart disease\n*   Do a physical exam\n*   Likely run some tests to help understand your personal risk for heart disease, including:\n    *   Blood tests to check your cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood sugar levels\n    *   A blood-pressure check\n    *   Heart tests, if needed\n\nDepending on your risk level, your provider may send you to a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in heart diseases) for care. If you do have heart disease, treatment will depend on the type of heart disease you have.\n\n**How Can I Prevent Diabetic Heart Disease?**\n\nYou may be able to prevent heart disease or keep it from getting worse by working with your provider to:\n\n*   Control your blood sugar levels\n*   Manage other conditions you may have that can raise your risk for heart disease\n*   Take any medicines your provider prescribed\n*   Make heart-healthy habits part of your daily life\n*   Follow a healthy eating plan for diabetes\n\n---\n\n**Diabetic Heart Disease**\n\nAre you at risk for diabetic heart disease?

Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.\n\nWith type 1 diabetes, your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood glucose levels.\n\n**What eye problems can diabetes cause?**\n\nOver time, high blood glucose may damage the blood vessels and lenses in your eyes. This can lead to serious diabetic eye problems which can harm your vision and sometimes cause blindness. Some common diabetic eye problems include:\n\n*   Diabetic retinopathy, which is the leading cause of blindness in American adults.\n*   Diabetic macular edema (DME), which happens when blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the macula.\n*   Glaucoma, a group of eye diseases that can damage the optic nerve.\n*   Cataract, which is the leading cause of blindness worldwide.\n\n**Who is more likely to develop diabetic eye problems?**\n\nAnyone with diabetes can develop diabetic eye disease.

A dilated eye exam uses eye drops to open your pupils wide so your eye care professional can look for signs of eye problems and treat them before they harm your vision. They will also test your vision and measure the pressure in your eyes.\n\n**What are the treatments for diabetic eye problems?**\n\nTreatment for diabetic eye problems depends on the problem and how serious it is. Some of the treatments include:\n\n*   Lasers to stop blood vessels from leaking\n*   Injections (shots) in the eye to stop new, leaky blood vessels from growing\n*   Surgery to remove blood and scar tissue or replace a cloudy lens\n*   Eye drops to lower fluid pressure in the eye\n\nBut these treatments aren't cures. Eye problems can come back. That's why your best defense against serious vision loss is to take control of your diabetes and get regular eye exams.

    "content": "**Diabetic Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar Syndrome**\n\n**What is Diabetic Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar Syndrome?**\n\nDiabetic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is a complication of type 2 diabetes. It involves an extremely high blood sugar (glucose) level without the presence of ketones.\n\n**Causes of HHS**\n\nHHS is a condition of:\n\n* Extremely high blood sugar level\n* Extreme lack of water (dehydration)\n* Decreased alertness or consciousness (in many cases)\n\nA buildup of ketones in the body (ketoacidosis) may also occur, but it is unusual and is often mild compared with diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\n**Risk Factors for HHS**\n\nHHS is more often seen in people with type 2 diabetes who don't have their diabetes under control. It may also occur in those who have not been diagnosed with diabetes. The condition may be brought on by:\n\n* Infection\n* Other illness, such as heart attack or stroke\n* Medicines that decrease the effect of insulin in the body\n* Medicines or conditions that increase fluid loss\n* Running out of, or not taking prescribed diabetes medicines\n\n**How Does HHS Develop?**\n\nNormally, the kidneys try to make up for a high glucose level in the blood by allowing the extra glucose to leave the body in the urine. But this also causes the body to lose water. If you do not drink enough water, or you drink fluids that contain sugar and keep eating foods with carbohydrates, you become very dehydrated. When this occurs, the kidneys are no longer able to get rid of the extra glucose. As a result, the glucose level in your blood can become very high, sometimes more than 10 times the normal amount.\n\n**Symptoms of HHS**\n\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\n\n* Increased thirst and urination (at the beginning of the syndrome)\n* Feeling weak\n* Nausea\n* Weight loss\n* Dry mouth, dry tongue\n* Fever\n* Seizures\n* Confusion\n* Coma\n\nSymptoms may get worse over days or weeks.\n\n**Exams and Tests for HHS**\n\nYour health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms and medical history. The exam may show that you have:\n\n* Extreme dehydration\n* Fever higher than 100.4°F (38°C)\n* Increased heart rate\n* Low systolic blood pressure\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n* Blood osmolarity (concentration)\n* BUN and creatinine levels\n* Blood sodium level (needs to be adjusted for the blood glucose level)\n* Ketone test\n* Blood glucose, potassium, and bicarbonate\n\n**Treatment of HHS**\n\nAt the start of treatment, the goal is to correct the water loss. This will improve the blood pressure, urine output, and circulation. Blood sugar will also decrease.\n\nFluids and potassium will be given through a vein (intravenously). This must be done carefully. A high glucose level may be treated with insulin given through a vein.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis) for HHS**\n\nPeople who develop HHS are often already ill. If not treated right away, seizures, coma, or death may result.\n\n**Possible Complications of HHS**\n\nUntreated, HHS may lead to any of the following:\n\n* Shock\n* Blood clot formation\n* Brain swelling (cerebral edema)\n* Increased blood acid level (lactic acidosis)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional for HHS**\n\nThis condition is a medical emergency. Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you develop symptoms of HHS.\n\n**Prevention of HHS**\n\nControlling type 2 diabetes and recognizing the early signs of dehydration and infection can help prevent HHS. Have a sick-day plan so you will be prepared for days when you are not going to be eating well. Also try to order your diabetes and other medicines in 3-month amounts so you will be less likely to run out of them.\n\n---\n\n**Diabetic Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar Syndrome**\n\n**What is Diabetic Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar Syndrome?**\n\nDiabetic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is a complication of type 2 diabetes.

    "content": "**Diabetic Ketoacidosis**\n\nDKA, or diabetic ketoacidosis, is a life-threatening problem that affects people with diabetes. It occurs when the body starts breaking down fat at a rate that is much too fast, causing the blood to become acidic.\n\n**Causes**\n\nDKA happens when the signal from insulin in the body is so low that:\n\n* Blood sugar (glucose) can't go into cells to be used as a fuel source.\n* The liver makes a large amount of glucose.\n* Fat is broken down too rapidly for the body to process.\n\nThe fat is broken down by the liver into a fuel called ketones. Ketones are normally produced by the liver when the body breaks down fat after it has been a long time since your last meal. These ketones are normally used by the muscles and the heart. When ketones are produced too quickly and build up in the blood, they can be toxic by making the blood acidic.\n\nDKA is sometimes the first sign of type 1 diabetes in people who have not yet been diagnosed. It can also occur in someone who has already been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Infection, injury, a serious illness, missing doses of insulin shots, or the stress of surgery can lead to DKA in people with type 1 diabetes.\n\nPeople with type 2 diabetes can also develop DKA, but it is much less common and less severe. It is usually triggered by prolonged uncontrolled blood sugar, missing doses of medicines, or a severe illness or infection.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCommon symptoms of DKA can include:\n\n* Decreased alertness\n* Deep, rapid breathing\n* Dehydration\n* Dry skin and mouth\n* Flushed face\n* Frequent urination or thirst that lasts for a day or more\n* Fruity-smelling breath\n* Headache\n* Muscle stiffness or aches\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Stomach pain\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nKetone testing may be used in type 1 diabetes to check for early ketoacidosis. The ketone test is usually done using a urine sample or a blood sample.\n\nKetone testing is usually done when DKA is suspected:\n\n* Most often, urine testing is done first.\n* If the urine is positive for ketones, most often a ketone called beta-hydroxybutyrate is measured in the blood. This is the most common ketone measured. The other main ketone is acetoacetate.\n\nOther tests for ketoacidosis include:\n\n* Arterial blood gas\n* Basic metabolic panel (a group of blood tests that measure your sodium and potassium levels, kidney function, and other chemicals and functions, including the anion gap)\n* Blood glucose test\n* Blood pressure measurement\n* Osmolality blood test\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to correct the high blood sugar level with insulin. Another goal is to replace fluids and bodily chemicals lost through urination, loss of appetite, and vomiting if you have these symptoms.\n\nIf you have diabetes, it is likely your health care provider told you how to spot the warning signs of DKA. If you think you have DKA, test for ketones using urine strips. Some glucose meters can also measure blood ketones. If ketones are present, contact your provider right away. Do not delay.\n\nIt is likely that you will need to go to the hospital. There, you will receive insulin, fluids, and other treatment for DKA. Then providers will also search for and treat the cause of DKA, such as an infection.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost people respond to treatment within 24 hours. Sometimes, it takes longer to recover.\n\nIf DKA is not treated, it can lead to severe illness or death.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nHealth problems that may result from DKA include any of the following:\n\n* Fluid buildup in the brain (cerebral edema)\n* Heart stops working (cardiac arrest)\n* Kidney failure\n\n---\n\n**Diabetic Ketoacidosis**\n\nDKA is a life-threatening problem that affects people with diabetes.

A variety of machines and techniques can create pictures of the structures and activities inside your body.\n\n**Types of Diagnostic Imaging**\n\nThe type of imaging your doctor uses depends on your symptoms and the part of your body being examined. They include:\n\n* X-rays\n* CT scans\n* Nuclear medicine scans\n* MRI scans\n* Ultrasound\n\n**What to Expect During an Imaging Test**\n\nMany imaging tests are painless and easy. Some require you to stay still for a long time inside a machine. This can be uncomfortable. Certain tests involve exposure to a small amount of radiation.\n\nFor some imaging tests, doctors insert a tiny camera attached to a long, thin tube into your body. This tool is called a scope. The doctor moves it through a body passageway or opening to see inside a particular organ, such as your heart, lungs, or colon. These procedures often require anesthesia.\n\n**Learn More**\n\n* Contrast Materials (American College of Radiology; Radiological Society of North America)\n* Imaging and radiology (Medical Encyclopedia)\n* Keeping Kids Still during Exams (American Society of Radiologic Technologists) - PDF - In English and Spanish\n* Overview of Imaging Tests (Merck & Co., Inc.)\n* Radiation Dose from X-Ray and CT Exams (American College of Radiology; Radiological Society of North America)\n* Radiation Safety for Children (American College of Radiology; Radiological Society of North America)\n* RadiologyInfo: Glossary of Terms (American College of Radiology; Radiological Society of North America)\n* Tracing the X-Ray Trail (American Society of Radiologic Technologists) - PDF - In English and Spanish\n* What is Indocyanine Green (ICG)?

    "content": "**Diagnostic Laparoscopy**\n\nDiagnostic laparoscopy is a procedure that allows your health care provider to look directly at the contents of the abdomen or pelvis.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThe procedure is usually done in the hospital or outpatient surgical center under general anesthesia (while you are asleep and pain-free). The surgeon makes a small cut (incision) below the belly button. A needle or hollow tube called a trocar is inserted into the incision, and carbon dioxide gas is passed into the abdomen through the needle or tube. This helps expand the area, giving the surgeon more room to work, and helps the surgeon see the organs more clearly. A tiny video camera (laparoscope) is then placed through the trocar and is used to see the inside of your pelvis and abdomen.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nFollow instructions on not eating and drinking before surgery. You may need to stop taking medicines, including narcotic pain relievers, on or before the day of the exam. Do not change or stop taking any medicines without first talking to your surgeon.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nYou will feel no pain during the procedure. Afterward, the incisions may be sore. Your surgeon may prescribe a pain reliever. You may also have shoulder pain for a few days due to the gas used during the procedure irritating the diaphragm. You may also have an increased urge to urinate.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nDiagnostic laparoscopy is often done for the following:\n\n* Find the cause of pain or a growth in the abdomen and pelvic area when x-ray or ultrasound results aren't clear.\n* After an accident to see if there is injury to any organs in the abdomen.\n* Before procedures to treat cancer to find out if the cancer has spread. If so, treatment will change.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe laparoscopy is normal if there is no blood in the abdomen, no hernias, no intestinal obstruction, and no cancer in any visible organs. The uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries are of normal size, shape, and color. The liver is normal.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal results may be due to a number of different conditions, including:\n\n* Scar tissue inside the abdomen or pelvis (adhesions)\n* Appendicitis\n* Cells from inside the uterus growing in other areas (endometriosis)\n* Inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis)\n* Ovarian cysts or cancer of the ovary\n* Infection of the uterus, ovaries, or fallopian tubes (pelvic inflammatory disease)\n* Signs of injury\n* Spread of cancer\n* Tumors\n* Noncancerous tumors of the uterus such as fibroids\n\n---\n\n**Diagnostic Laparoscopy**\n\nDiagnostic laparoscopy is a procedure that allows your health care provider to look directly at the contents of the abdomen or pelvis.\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nThe procedure is usually done in the hospital or outpatient surgical center under general anesthesia (while you are asleep and pain-free).

More small cuts may be made if other instruments are needed to get a better view of certain organs. If you are having gynecologic laparoscopy, dye may be injected into your cervix so the surgeon can view the fallopian tubes.\n\nAfter the exam, the gas, laparoscope, and instruments are removed, and the cuts are closed. You will have bandages over those areas.\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\nFollow instructions on not eating and drinking before surgery. You may need to stop taking medicines, including narcotic pain relievers, on or before the day of the exam. Do not change or stop taking any medicines without first talking to your surgeon.\n\n**What to Expect After the Test**\n\nYou will feel no pain during the procedure. Afterward, the incisions may be sore. Your surgeon may prescribe a pain reliever. You may also have shoulder pain for a few days due to the gas used during the procedure. You will recover for a few hours at the hospital before going home.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nDiagnostic laparoscopy is often done for the following:\n\n* To investigate abdominal or pelvic symptoms that cannot be explained by other tests\n* To evaluate the cause of infertility in women\n* To diagnose and treat endometriosis, a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus\n* To diagnose and treat ovarian cysts or cancer of the ovary\n* To investigate signs of injury or infection in the abdomen or pelvis\n\n---\n\n**Diagnostic Laparoscopy**\n\nYou will not be allowed to drive home. Someone must be available to take you home after the procedure.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\n* Find the cause of pain or a growth in the abdomen and pelvic area when x-ray or ultrasound results aren't clear.\n* After an accident to see if there is injury to any organs in the abdomen.\n* Before procedures to treat cancer to find out if the cancer has spread.

You may get antibiotics to prevent this complication.\n\nThere is a risk of puncturing an organ. This could cause the contents of the intestines to leak. There may also be bleeding into the abdominal cavity. These complications could require immediate open surgery to treat them (laparotomy).\n\nDiagnostic laparoscopy may not be possible if you have a swollen bowel, fluid in the abdomen (ascites), or you have had a past surgery.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nLaparoscopy - diagnostic; Exploratory laparoscopy\n\n**Images**\n\n* Pelvic laparoscopy\n* Female reproductive anatomy\n* Incision for abdominal laparoscopy\n\n**References**\n\nFalcone T, Walters MD.

    "content": "**Dialysis - Hemodialysis**\n\nDialysis treats end-stage kidney disease, also called kidney failure. It removes waste from your blood when your kidneys can no longer do their job.\n\n**What is Hemodialysis?**\n\nYour kidneys' main job is to remove toxins and extra fluid from your blood as well as to regulate some of the chemicals in your blood. If waste products build up in your body, it can be dangerous and even cause death.\n\nHemodialysis (and other types of dialysis) does some of the job of the kidneys when they stop working well.\n\n**Benefits of Hemodialysis**\n\n*   Remove extra salt, water, and waste products so they don't build up in your body\n*   Keep safe levels of minerals and vitamins in your body\n*   Help control blood pressure\n*   Help produce red blood cells\n\n**When to Start Dialysis**\n\nKidney failure is the last stage of long-term chronic kidney disease. This is when your kidneys can no longer support your body's needs. Your health care provider will discuss dialysis with you before you need it. Usually, you will go on dialysis when you have only 10% to 15% of your kidney function left.\n\nYou also may need dialysis if your kidneys suddenly stop working due to acute renal failure.\n\n**Dialysis at a Treatment Center**\n\nHemodialysis is most often done at a special dialysis center.\n\n*   You will have about 3 treatments a week.\n*   Treatment takes about 3 to 4 hours each time.\n*   You may feel tired for several hours after the dialysis.\n\n---\n\n**Dialysis - Hemodialysis**\n\nDialysis treats end-stage kidney disease also called kidney failure. It removes waste from your blood when your kidneys can no longer do their job.\n\nThere are different types of kidney dialysis. This article focuses on hemodialysis.\n\n**What is Hemodialysis?**\n\nYour kidneys' main job is to remove toxins and extra fluid from your blood as well as to regulate some of the chemicals in your blood. If waste products build up in your body, it can be dangerous and even cause death.\n\nHemodialysis (and other types of dialysis) does some of the job of the kidneys when they stop working well.\n\nHemodialysis can:\n\n* Remove extra salt, water, and waste products so they don't build up in your body\n* Keep safe levels of minerals and vitamins in your body\n* Help control blood pressure\n* Help produce red blood cells\n\nDuring hemodialysis, your blood passes through a tube into an artificial kidney or filter.\n\nThe filter, called a dialyzer, is divided into 2 parts separated by a thin wall.\n\nAs your blood passes through one part of the filter, special fluid in the other part draws out waste from your blood.\n\nYour blood then goes back into your body through a tube.\n\nYour doctor will create an access where the tube attaches. Usually, an access will be in a blood vessel in your arm.\n\n**When to Start Dialysis**\n\nKidney failure is the last stage of long-term chronic kidney disease. This is when your kidneys can no longer support your body's needs. Your health care provider will discuss dialysis with you before you need it. Usually, you will go on dialysis when you have only 10% to 15% of your kidney function left.\n\nYou also may need dialysis if your kidneys suddenly stop working due to acute renal failure.\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nThere are different types of hemodialysis treatment options:\n\n* **In-Center Hemodialysis**: You will have about 3 treatments a week. Treatment takes about 3 to 4 hours each time.\n* **Home Hemodialysis**: You can do the treatment yourself, or you can have someone help you. A dialysis nurse can train you and a caregiver on how to do home dialysis.\n\n**Benefits of Home Hemodialysis**\n\nHome hemodialysis has some benefits:\n\n* It helps keep your blood pressure lower.\n* It does a better job of removing waste products.\n* It's easier on your heart.\n* You may have fewer symptoms from dialysis such as nausea, headaches, cramps, itching, and tiredness.\n\n**When to Call Your Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if you notice:\n\n* Bleeding from your vascular access site\n* Signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, soreness, pain, warmth, or pus around the site\n* A fever over 100.5°F (38.0°C)\n* The arm where your catheter is placed swells and the hand on that side feels cold\n* Your hand gets cold, numb, or weak\n\nAlso, contact your provider if any of the following symptoms are severe or last more than 2 days:\n\n* Itching\n* Trouble sleeping\n* Diarrhea or constipation\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Drowsiness, confusion, or problems concentrating\n\n---\n\n**Dialysis - Hemodialysis**\n\n\\n\\nYou will need dialysis when your kidneys can no longer support your body's needs. This is usually when you have only 10% to 15% of your kidney function left.\n\n*   You may also need dialysis if your kidneys suddenly stop working due to acute renal failure.\n*   Kidney failure is the last stage of long-term chronic kidney disease.\n\n**Dialysis at a Treatment Center**\n\nHemodialysis is most often done at a special dialysis center.\n\n*   You will have about 3 treatments a week.\n*   Treatment takes about 3 to 4 hours each time.\n*   You may feel tired for several hours after the dialysis.\n\nAt a treatment center, your providers will handle all your care. However, you do need to schedule your appointments and follow a strict dialysis diet.\n\n\\n\\n**Dialysis at Home**\n\nYou may be able to have hemodialysis at home. You do not have to buy a machine. Medicare or your health insurance will pay for most or all of your treatment costs at home or in a center.\n\n*   If you have dialysis at home, you can use one of two schedules:\n    *   Shorter (2 to 3 hours) treatments done at least 5 to 7 days per week\n    *   Longer, nightly treatments done 3 to 6 nights per week while you sleep\n*   You also may be able to do a combination of daily and nighttime treatments.\n\nBecause you have treatment more often and it happens more slowly, home hemodialysis has some benefits:\n\n*   It helps keep your blood pressure lower. Many people no longer need blood pressure medicines.\n*   It does a better job of removing waste products.\n*   It's easier on your heart.\n*   You may have fewer symptoms from dialysis such as nausea, headaches, cramps, itching, and tiredness.\n*   You can more easily fit treatments into your schedule.\n\nYou can do the treatment yourself, or you can have someone help you. A dialysis nurse can train you and a caregiver on how to do home dialysis. Training can take a few weeks to a few months. Both you and your caregivers must learn to:\n\n*   Handle the equipment\n*   Place the needle into the access site\n*   Monitor the machine and your blood pressure during treatment\n*   Keep records\n*   Clean the machine\n*   Order supplies, which can be delivered to your home\n\nHome dialysis is not for everyone. You will have a lot to learn and need to be responsible for your care. Some people feel more comfortable having a provider handle their treatment. Plus, not all centers offer home dialysis.\n\nHome dialysis may be a good option if you want more independence and are able to learn to treat yourself. Talk with your provider. Together, you can decide what type of hemodialysis is right for you.\n\n\\n\\n**When to Call Your Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if you notice:\n\n*   Bleeding from your vascular access site\n*   Signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, soreness, pain, warmth, or pus around the site\n*   A fever over 100.5°F (38.0°C)\n*   The arm where your catheter is placed swells and the hand on that side feels cold\n*   Your hand gets cold, numb, or weak\n\nAlso, contact your provider if any of the following symptoms are severe or last more than 2 days:\n\n*   Itching\n*   Trouble sleeping\n*   Diarrhea or constipation\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Drowsiness, confusion, or problems concentrating\n\n---\n\n**Dialysis - Hemodialysis**\n\n**Symptoms of Dialysis**\n\n*   wsiness, confusion, or problems concentrating\n*   Contact your provider if you notice any of these symptoms.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n*   Artificial kidneys - hemodialysis; Dialysis; Renal replacement therapy - hemodialysis; End-stage renal disease - hemodialysis; Kidney failure - hemodialysis; Renal failure - hemodialysis; Chronic kidney disease - hemodialysis\n\n**References**\n\n*   Cohen D, Valeri AM.
