Children who go to day care are often around other kids who may be sick. However, being around the large number of germs in day care may actually improve your child's immune system in the long run.\n\n**Infections and Germs**\n\n* Diarrhea and gastroenteritis are common at day care centers. These infections cause vomiting, diarrhea, or both.\n* The infection is spread easily from child-to-child or from caregiver-to-child. It is common among children because they are less likely to wash their hands after using the toilet.\n* Children who are attending day care may also get giardiasis, which is caused by a parasite. This infection causes diarrhea, stomach cramps, and gas.\n* Ear infections, colds, coughs, sore throats, and runny noses are common in all children, especially in the day care setting.\n* Children attending day care are at risk of getting hepatitis A. Hepatitis A is irritation and swelling (inflammation) of the liver caused by the hepatitis A virus.\n* It is spread by poor or no hand washing after using the toilet or changing a diaper, and then preparing food.\n* In addition to good hand washing, day care staff and children should get the hepatitis A vaccine.\n* Bug infections, such as head lice and scabies, are other common health problems that occur in day care centers.\n\n**Keeping Your Child Safe**\n\nYou can do a number of things to keep your child safe from infections. One is to keep your child up-to-date with routine vaccines (immunizations) to prevent both common and serious infections:\n\n* To see the current recommendations, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website -- www.cdc.gov/vaccines/. At every health care provider visit, ask about the next recommended vaccines.\n* Make sure your child has a flu shot every year after age 6 months.\n\nYour child's day care center should have policies to help prevent the spread of germs and infections. Ask to see these policies before your child starts. Day care staff should be trained in how to follow these policies. In addition to proper hand washing throughout the day, important policies include:\n\n* Preparing food and changing diapers in different areas\n* Making sure day care staff and children who attend the day care have up-to-date immunizations\n* Rules about when staff and children should stay home if they are sick and when it is safe to come back to day care\n\n**When Your Child Has a Health Problem**\n\nStaff may need to know:\n\n* How to give medicines for conditions, such as asthma\n* How to avoid allergy and asthma triggers\n* How to take care of different skin conditions\n* How to recognize when a chronic medical problem is getting worse\n* Activities that may not be safe for the child\n* How to contact your child's provider\n\nYou can help by creating an action plan with your provider and making sure your child's day care staff knows how to follow that plan.\n\n---\n\n**Day Care Health Risks**\n\nChildren in day care centers are more likely to catch an infection than kids who do not attend day care.

    "content": "**Day to Day with COPD**\n\nAs a person living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), there is no cure, but there are things you can do every day to keep COPD from getting worse, protect your lungs, and stay healthy.\n\n**Manage Your Days**\n\nHaving COPD can sap your energy. These simple changes can make your days easier and preserve your strength:\n\n*   Ask for help when you need it.\n*   Give yourself more time for daily activities.\n*   Take breaks to catch your breath when you need to.\n*   Learn pursed lip breathing.\n*   Stay physically and mentally active.\n*   Set up your house so things you use every day are easily within reach.\n*   Avoid going up and down the stairs multiple times per day.\n\nLearn how to recognize and manage COPD flare-ups.\n\n**Clear the Air**\n\nYour lungs need clean air. So if you smoke, the best thing you can do for your lungs is quit smoking. Talk with your provider about ways to quit. Ask about support groups and other stop-smoking strategies.\n\nEven secondhand smoke can cause further damage. So ask other people not to smoke around you, and if possible, quit altogether.\n\n**Eat Well**\n\nYour diet affects COPD in several ways. Food gives you fuel to breathe. Moving air in and out of your lungs takes more work and burns more calories when you have COPD.\n\nYour weight also affects COPD. Being overweight makes it harder to breathe. But if you are too thin, your body will have a hard time fighting illnesses.\n\nTips for eating well with COPD include:\n\n*   Eat small meals and snacks that give you energy, but do not leave you feeling stuffed.\n*   Drink water or other liquids throughout the day. About 6 to 8 cups (1.5 to 2 liters) a day is a good goal.\n*   Eat healthy proteins like low-fat milk and cheese, eggs, meat, fish, and nuts.\n*   Eat healthy fats like olive or canola oils and soft margarine. Ask your provider how much fat you should eat a day.\n*   Limit sugary snacks like cakes, cookies, and soda.\n*   If needed, limit foods like beans, cabbage, and fizzy drinks if they make you feel full and gassy.\n\nIf you need to lose weight:\n\n*   Lose weight gradually.\n*   Replace 3 large meals a day with several smaller meals. That way you won't get too hungry.\n*   Talk with your provider about an exercise plan that will help you burn calories.\n\nIf you need to gain weight, look for ways to add calories to your meals:\n\n*   Add a teaspoon (5 milliliters) of butter or olive oil to vegetables and soups.\n*   Stock your kitchen with high-energy snacks like walnuts, almonds, and string cheese.\n*   Add peanut butter or mayonnaise to your sandwiches.\n*   Drink milkshakes with high-fat ice cream. Add protein powder for an added boost of calories.\n\n**Exercise**\n\nExercise is good for everyone, including people with COPD. Being active can build your strength so you can breathe easier. It can also help you stay healthier for longer.\n\nTalk to your provider about what kind of exercise is right for you. Then start slow. You may only be able to walk a short distance at first. Over time, you should be able to go longer.\n\nAsk your provider about pulmonary rehabilitation. This is a formal program where specialists teach you to breathe, exercise, and live well with COPD.\n\nTry to exercise for at least 15 minutes, 3 times a week.\n\nIf you become winded, slow down and rest.\n\nStop exercising and call your provider if you feel:\n\n*   Pain in your chest, neck, arm or jaw\n*   Sick to your stomach\n*   Dizzy or lightheaded\n\n**Sleep**\n\nA good night's sleep can make you feel better and keep you healthier. But when you have COPD, certain things make it harder to get enough rest:\n\n*   You might wake up short of breath or coughing.\n*   Some COPD medicines make it hard to sleep.\n*   You might have to take a dose of medicine in the middle of the night.\n\nHere are some safe ways to sleep better:\n\n*   Let your provider know you are having trouble sleeping. A change in your treatment might help you sleep.\n*   Go to bed at the same time every night.\n*   Do something to relax before you go to bed. You might take a bath or read a book.\n*   Use window shades to block outside light.\n*   Ask your family to help keep the house quiet when it is time for you to sleep.\n*   Do not use over-the-counter sleep aids. They can make it harder to breathe.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if your breathing is:\n\n*   Getting harder\n*   Faster than before\n*   Shallow, and you cannot get a deep breath\n\nAlso contact your provider if:\n\n*   You need to lean forward when sitting in order to breathe easily\n*   You are using muscles around your ribs to help you breathe\n*   You are having headaches more often\n*   You cannot speak more than a few words without getting short of breath\n*   You feel sleepy or confused\n*   You have a fever\n*   You are coughing up dark mucus\n*   You are coughing up more mucus than usual\n*   Your lips, fingertips, or the skin around your fingernails, are blue\n\n---\n\n**Day to Day with COPD**\n\nHaving COPD can be a challenging experience, but there are steps you can take every day to manage your condition and preserve your strength.\n\n**Manage Your Days**\n\nCOPD can sap your energy, making daily activities more difficult. To make the most of your days:\n\n*   Ask for help when you need it\n*   Give yourself more time for daily activities\n*   Take breaks to catch your breath when needed\n*   Learn pursed lip breathing\n*   Stay physically and mentally active\n*   Set up your house so things you use every day are easily within reach\n*   Avoid going up and down the stairs multiple times per day\n\nBy implementing these simple changes, you can conserve your energy and make the most of your days.\n\n**Clear the Air**\n\nYour lungs need clean air to function properly. If you smoke, quitting is the best thing you can do for your lungs. Talk with your provider about ways to quit, and ask about support groups and other stop-smoking strategies. Even secondhand smoke can cause further damage, so ask others not to smoke around you and consider quitting altogether.\n\nBy clearing the air and taking steps to reduce pollution, you can help protect your lungs and manage your COPD more effectively.\n\n---\n\n**Day to Day with COPD**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Clear the Air**\n\nYour lungs need clean air. So if you smoke, the best thing you can do for your lungs is quit smoking. Talk with your provider about ways to quit. Ask about support groups and other stop-smoking strategies.\n\nEven secondhand smoke can cause further damage. So ask other people not to smoke around you, and if possible, quit altogether.\n\nYou should also avoid other forms of pollution like car exhaust and dust. On days when air pollution is high, close the windows and stay inside if you can.\n\nAlso, stay inside when it is too hot or too cold.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Eat Well**\n\nYour diet affects COPD in several ways. Food gives you fuel to breathe. Moving air in and out of your lungs takes more work and burns more calories when you have COPD.\n\nYour weight also affects COPD. Being overweight makes it harder to breathe. But if you are too thin, your body will have a hard time fighting illnesses.\n\nTips for eating well with COPD include:\n\n*   Eat small meals and snacks that give you energy, but do not leave you feeling stuffed. Large meals may make it harder for you to breathe.\n*   Drink water or other liquids throughout the day. About 6 to 8 cups (1.5 to 2 liters) a day is a good goal. Drinking plenty of fluids helps thin mucus so it is easier to get rid of it.\n*   Eat healthy proteins like low-fat milk and cheese, eggs, meat, fish, and nuts.\n*   Eat healthy fats like olive or canola oils and soft margarine. Ask your provider how much fat you should eat a day.\n*   Limit sugary snacks like cakes, cookies, and soda.\n*   If needed, limit foods like beans, cabbage, and fizzy drinks if they make you feel full and gassy.\n\nIf you need to lose weight:\n\n*   Lose weight gradually.\n*   Replace 3 large meals a day with several smaller meals. That way you won't get too hungry.\n*   Talk with your provider about an exercise plan that will help you burn calories.\n\nIf you need to gain weight, look for ways to add calories to your meals:\n\n*   Add a teaspoon (5 milliliters) of butter or olive oil to vegetables and soups.\n*   Stock your kitchen with high-energy snacks like walnuts, almonds, and string cheese.\n*   Add peanut butter or mayonnaise to your sandwiches.\n*   Drink milkshakes with high-fat ice cream. Add protein powder for an added boost of calories.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exercise**\n\nExercise is good for everyone, including people with COPD. Being active can build your strength so you can breathe easier. It can also help you stay healthier for longer.\n\nTalk to your provider about what kind of exercise is right for you. Then start slow.

    "content": "**De Quervain Tendinitis**\n\nA tendon is thick, bendable tissue that connects muscle to bone. Two tendons run from the back of your thumb down the side of your wrist. De Quervain tendinitis is caused when these tendons are thickened and irritated.\n\n**More About Your Injury**\n\nDe Quervain tendinitis can be caused by playing sports such as tennis, golf, or rowing. Constantly lifting babies and toddlers can also strain the tendons in the wrist and lead to this condition.\n\nIf you have De Quervain tendinitis, you may notice:\n\n* Pain on the back of your thumb when you make a fist, grab something, or turn your wrist\n* Numbness in the thumb and index finger\n* Swelling of the wrist\n* Stiffness when moving your thumb or wrist\n* Popping of the wrist tendons\n* Difficulty pinching things with your thumb\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nDe Quervain tendinitis is usually treated with rest, splints, medicine, changes in activity, and exercise. Your health care provider may also give you a shot of cortisone to help decrease pain and swelling.\n\nIf your tendinitis is chronic, you may need surgery to give the tendon more room to slide without rubbing on the wall of the tunnel that guides it.\n\n**Symptom Relief**\n\nIce your wrist for 20 minutes of every hour while awake. Wrap the ice in a cloth. Do not put the ice directly on the skin because this can result in frostbite.\n\nFor pain, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol). You can buy these pain medicines at the store.\n\nTalk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, liver disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.\nDo not take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your provider.\n\n**Activity**\n\nRest your wrist and your thumb. Keep your wrist and thumb from moving for at least 1 week. You can do this with a wrist and thumb splint.\n\nWear a wrist splint during any sports or activities that could put stress on your wrist.\n\nOnce you can move your wrist without pain, you can start light stretching to increase strength and movement.\n\nYour provider may recommend physical therapy so that you can return to normal activity as soon as possible.\n\nTo increase strength and flexibility, do light stretching exercises. One exercise is squeezing a tennis ball.\n\nLightly grasp a tennis ball.\nGently squeeze the ball and add more pressure if there is no pain or discomfort.\nHold for 5 seconds, then release your grip.\nRepeat 5 to 10 times.\nDo this a few times a day.\n\nBefore and after any activity:\n\nUse a heating pad on your wrist to warm the area.\nMassage the area around your wrist and thumb to loosen the muscles.\nIce your wrist and take pain medicine after activity if there is discomfort.\n\nThe best way for the tendons to heal is to stick to a care plan. The more you rest and do the exercises, the quicker your wrist will heal.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nFollow up with your provider if:\n\n* The pain is not improving or becomes worse\n* Your wrist becomes more stiff\n* You have increasing numbness or tingling in the wrist and fingers, or if they turn white or blue\n\n---\n\n**De Quervain Tendinitis**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nDe Quervain tendinitis is a condition where the tendons in the wrist are thickened and irritated.

    "content": "**Dealing with Chronic Cancer**\n\nSometimes cancer cannot be fully treated. This means there is no way to get rid of the cancer completely, yet the cancer also may not progress rapidly. Some cancers can be made to go away but come back and are treated successfully again.\n\nIt may be possible to control the cancer for months or years. Doing so may require ongoing treatment to help keep the cancer from progressing for as long as possible. Therefore, it becomes more like a chronic illness.\n\n**Cancer That Won't Go Away**\n\nCertain types of cancer are or may become chronic and never completely go away:\n\n* Chronic leukemia\n* Some types of lymphoma\n* Ovarian cancer\n* Breast cancer\n* Prostate cancer\n\nOften, these cancers have spread to other parts of the body (metastasized). They cannot be cured, but can often be controlled for a period of time that may be years long.\n\n**Controlling Chronic Cancer**\n\nWhen you have a chronic cancer, the focus is on keeping it under control, not to cure the cancer. This means keeping the tumor from getting larger or spreading to other areas. Treatment for chronic cancer can also help manage symptoms.\n\nWhen cancer is not growing, it is called being in remission or having stable disease. Your health care provider will keep a close watch on the cancer to look for any growth. You may need ongoing treatment to help keep the cancer under control. This is called maintenance treatment.\n\nIf your cancer starts to grow or spread, you may need a different treatment to try to make it shrink or stop growing. Your cancer may go through several rounds of growing and shrinking. Or your cancer may not grow at all for many years.\n\nSince each person and each cancer is different, your provider may not be able to tell you exactly how long your cancer can be controlled.\n\n**Treatment for Chronic Cancer**\n\nChemotherapy (chemo) or immunotherapy may be used for chronic cancers. There are many types of medicines from which to choose. If one kind does not work, or stops working, your provider may suggest using another one.\n\nSometimes, cancer can become resistant to all of the treatments approved to treat it. If this happens, talk with your provider about your options. You may want to try another treatment, join a clinical trial, or you may decide to stop treatment.\n\nWhatever treatment you receive, it is very important to follow your provider's instructions for taking the drug. Go to your provider appointments as scheduled. If you have any side effects, tell your provider. There may be ways to lessen side effects. Do not stop taking any drug without first talking with your provider.\n\n**How Long to Continue Treatment**\n\nThere is no limit on how long you can continue treatment for chronic cancer. It is a personal decision you need to make with the help of your provider and loved ones. Your decision may depend on:\n\n* The type of cancer you have\n* Your age\n* Your overall health\n* How you feel after treatment\n* How well the treatment works to control your cancer\n* The side effects you have with treatment\n\nIf you do decide to stop treatment that is no longer working, you can still get palliative care or hospice care to treat the symptoms of your cancer. This will not help treat the cancer, but it can help you feel your best for the time you have left.\n\n**Living with Cancer**\n\nIt is not easy to live with a cancer you know will not go away. You may feel sad, angry, or afraid. These suggestions may help you cope:\n\n* Do things you enjoy. This might include going to see music or theater, traveling, or fishing. Whatever it is, make time to do it.\n* Enjoy the present. Try to focus on enjoying the present instead of worrying about the future. Focus on the small things that bring you joy every day, such as spending time with family, reading a good book, or walking in the woods.\n* Share your feelings. Sharing your feelings with others may help you feel better. You can talk with a close family member or friend, join a support group, or meet with a counselor or clergy member.\n* Let go of worry. Feeling worried is normal, but try not to let these thoughts take over. Acknowledge these fears and then practice letting them go.\n\n**References**\n\nAmerican Cancer Society website.

The T-shape also blocks sperm and keeps them from reaching the egg.\n\t+ Can stay in the uterus for up to 10 years.\n\t+ Can also be used for emergency contraception.\n* **Progestin-releasing IUDs**\n\t+ Start to work within 7 days after being inserted.\n\t+ Work by releasing progestin, a hormone used in many kinds of birth control pills. It prevents the ovaries from releasing an egg.\n\t+ Have a T-shape that also blocks the sperm and keeps sperm from reaching an egg.\n\t+ Are FDA approved to stay in the uterus for 3 to 8 years. How long depends on the brand.\n\n**How IUDs work**\n\nBoth types of IUDs prevent sperm from fertilizing an egg.\n\nProgestin-releasing IUDs also work by:\n\n* Making the mucus around the cervix thicker, which makes it harder for sperm to get inside the uterus and fertilize an egg.\n* Thinning the lining of the uterus, which makes it more difficult for a fertilized egg to attach to the uterus.\n\n**Pros and cons**\n\nIUDs have certain benefits:\n\n* They are more than 99% effective at preventing pregnancy.\n* You don't need to think about birth control each time you have sex.\n* One IUD can last for 3 to 10 years, making it one of the cheapest forms of birth control.\n* You become fertile again almost immediately after an IUD is removed.\n* Copper-releasing IUDs do not have hormonal side effects and may help protect against uterine (endometrial) cancer.\n* Both types of IUDs may lower the risk of developing cervical cancer.\n\nThere are also downsides:\n\n* IUDs do not prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). To avoid STDs, you need to abstain from sex, be in a mutually monogamous relationship, or use condoms.\n* A provider needs to insert or remove the IUD.\n* While rare, an IUD can slip out of place and need to be removed.\n* Copper-releasing IUDs can cause cramps, longer and heavier menstrual periods, and spotting between periods.\n* Progestin-releasing IUDs can cause irregular bleeding and spotting during the first few months.\n* IUDs may increase the risk for ectopic pregnancy. But women who use IUDs have a very low risk of getting pregnant.\n* Some types of IUDs may increase the risk for benign ovarian cysts.

The protection lasts for about 10 years.\n\n**Bleeding and Cancer Risks**\n\nMost experts believe that taking HT for up to 5 years does not increase your risk for breast cancer. However, taking estrogen and progestin together for longer than 3 to 5 years may increase your risk for breast cancer, depending on the type of progestin you are prescribed.\n\nTaking estrogen alone is associated with a reduction in risk of breast cancer. However, if you take estrogen and progestin together, your risk of breast cancer may be higher, depending on the type of progesterone you take.\n\nTaking estrogen alone increases your risk for endometrial cancer. Taking progestin with estrogen protects against this cancer. If you have a uterus, you should take HT with both estrogen and progestin.\n\n**Making a Decision**\n\nEvery woman is different. Some women aren't bothered by menopause symptoms. For others, symptoms are severe and affect their lives significantly.\n\nCertain lifestyle changes can help you adjust to the changes of menopause without taking hormones. They can also help protect your bones, improve your heart health, and help you stay fit.\n\nHowever, for many women, taking HT is a safe way to treat menopause symptoms.\n\nCurrently, experts are unclear on how long you should take HT. Some professional groups suggest that you can take HT for menopause symptoms for longer periods if there is no medical reason to discontinue the medicine. For many women, low doses of HT may be enough to control troublesome symptoms. Low doses of HT tend to have few side effects.\n\nThese are all issues to discuss with your provider.\n\n---\n\n**Deciding about hormone therapy**\n\nIf you're considering hormone therapy (HT) to treat menopause symptoms, there are several factors to discuss with your provider. Every woman is different, and some may not be bothered by menopause symptoms, while others may experience severe symptoms that affect their daily lives.\n\n**Benefits of HT**\n\nFor many women, taking low doses of HT can help control troublesome symptoms without causing significant side effects. In fact, low doses of HT tend to have few side effects. If you're experiencing menopause symptoms, talking to your doctor about the benefits and risks of HT may be a good option for you.\n\n**When to consider HT**\n\nCertain lifestyle changes can help you adjust to the changes of menopause without taking hormones. However, for many women, taking HT is a safe way to treat menopause symptoms. If you're unsure whether HT is right for you, discuss your options with your provider.\n\n**What to expect from HT**\n\nHT may be prescribed for longer periods if there's no medical reason to discontinue the medicine. Your provider should know your medical history before prescribing HT. You should not take HT if you have certain health conditions or are pregnant.\n\n**When to call the doctor**\n\nIf you experience vaginal bleeding or other unusual symptoms during HT, contact your provider immediately. It's also essential to continue seeing your provider for regular checkups.\n\n**References**\n\n* ACOG Committee Opinion No. 565: Hormone therapy and heart disease.

    "content": "**Deciding to Have Knee or Hip Replacement**\n\nThere are many things you can do to help decide whether to have knee or hip replacement surgery or not. These may include reading about the operation and talking to others with knee or hip problems.\n\nA key step is talking to your health care provider about your quality of life and goals for surgery.\n\nSurgery may or may not be the right choice for you. Only careful thought can help you make a decision.\n\n**Who Benefits From Knee or Hip Replacement Surgery?**\n\nThe most common reason to have a knee or hip replaced is to provide relief from severe arthritis pain that limits your activities. Your provider may recommend replacement surgery when:\n\n* Pain prevents you from sleeping or doing normal activities.\n* You cannot move around by yourself and have to use a cane or walker.\n* You cannot safely care for yourself due to your level of pain and disability.\n* Your pain has not improved with other treatment.\n* You understand the surgery and recovery involved.\n\nSome people are more willing to accept the limits knee or hip pain places on them. They will wait until the problems are more severe. Others will want to have joint replacement surgery in order to continue with sports and other activities they enjoy.\n\nKnee or hip replacements are most often done in people who are 60 and older. However, many people who have this surgery are younger. When a knee or hip replacement is done, the new joint may wear out over time. This is more likely to occur in people with more active lifestyles or in those who will likely live longer after surgery. Unfortunately, if a second joint replacement is needed in the future, it may not work as well as the first.\n\n**Is There Any Harm in Waiting?**\n\nFor the most part, knee and hip replacement are elective procedures. This means these surgeries are done when you are ready to seek relief for your pain, not for emergency medical reason.\n\nIn most cases, delaying surgery should not make joint replacement less effective if you choose to have it in the future. In some cases, the provider may strongly recommend surgery if deformity or extreme wear and tear on the joint affects other parts of your body.\n\nAlso, if pain is preventing you from moving around well, the muscles around your joints may become weaker and your bones may become thinner. You may also become weaker as the body cannot exercise with the limited activity. This may prolong your recovery time and limit your outcome if you have surgery at a later date.\n\n**Why You May Not Be Able to Have Replacement Surgery**\n\nYour provider may recommend against knee or hip replacement surgery if you have any of the following:\n\n* Extreme obesity (weighing over 300 pounds or 135 kilograms)\n* Weak quadriceps, the muscles in the front of your thighs, that can make it very hard for you to walk and use your knee\n* Unhealthy skin around the joint\n* Previous infection of your knee or hip\n* Previous surgery or injuries that do not allow for a successful joint replacement\n* Heart or lung problems, which make major surgery more risky\n* Unhealthy behaviors such as excessive alcohol drinking, smoking, drug use, or high risk activities\n* Other health conditions that may not allow you to recover well from joint replacement surgery\n\n---\n\n**Deciding to Have Knee or Hip Replacement**\n\nAre you considering having knee or hip replacement surgery?

    "content": "**Decitabine Injection**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nDecitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (a group of conditions in which the bone marrow produces blood cells that are misshapen and does not produce enough healthy blood cells). Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nDecitabine comes as a powder to be added to fluid and injected slowly over 3 hours intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a medical office or hospital outpatient clinic. It is usually injected every 8 hours for 3 days. This treatment period is called a cycle, and the cycle may be repeated every 6 weeks for as long as your doctor recommends. Decitabine should usually be given for at least four cycles but may be continued if your doctor decides that you will benefit from additional treatment.\n\nYour doctor may also need to delay your treatment and reduce your dose if you experience certain side effects. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment with decitabine.\n\nYour doctor will give you medication to prevent nausea and vomiting before you receive each dose of decitabine.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore receiving a dose of decitabine, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to decitabine or any other medications. Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\nTell your doctor if you have kidney or liver disease.

    "content": "**Deep Brain Stimulation**\n\n**What is Deep Brain Stimulation?**\n\nDeep brain stimulation (DBS) uses a device called a neurostimulator to deliver electrical signals to the areas of the brain that control movement, pain, mood, weight, obsessive-compulsive thoughts, and awakening from a coma.\n\n**The DBS System**\n\nThe DBS system consists of four parts:\n\n* One or more insulated wires called leads, or electrodes, that are placed into the brain\n* Anchors to fix the leads to the skull\n* The neurostimulator, which puts out the electric current. The neurostimulator is like a heart pacemaker.\n* In some people another thin, insulated wire called an extension is added to connect the lead to the neurostimulator\n\n**Surgery**\n\nSurgery is done to place each part of the neurostimulator system. In adults, the whole system can be placed in 1 or 2 stages (two separate surgeries).\n\n**Stage 1**\n\n* Stage 1 is usually done under local anesthesia, meaning you are awake, but pain-free.\n* A bit of hair on your head is likely shaved.\n* Your head may be placed in a special frame using small screws to keep it still during the procedure.\n* Numbing medicine is applied where the screws contact the scalp.\n* Sometimes, the procedure is done in the MRI machine and a frame is on top of your head rather than around your head.\n* Numbing medicine is applied to your scalp at the site where the surgeon will open the skin, then drill a small opening (burr hole) in the skull and place the lead into a specific area of the brain.\n\n**Stage 2**\n\n* Stage 2 is done under general anesthesia, meaning you are asleep and pain-free.\n* The timing of this stage of surgery depends on where in the brain the stimulator will be placed.\n* The surgeon makes a small opening (incision), usually just below the collarbone and implants the neurostimulator under the skin.\n\n**Why DBS is Performed**\n\nDBS is commonly done for people with Parkinson disease when the symptoms cannot be controlled by medicines. DBS does not cure Parkinson disease, but can help reduce symptoms such as:\n\n* Tremors\n* Rigidity\n* Stiffness\n* Slow movements\n* Walking problems\n\nDBS may also be used to treat the following conditions:\n\n* Major depression that does not respond well to medicines\n* Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)\n* Pain that does not go away (chronic pain)\n* Severe obesity\n* Shaking movement that cannot be controlled and the cause is unknown (essential tremor)\n* Tourette syndrome (in rare cases)\n* Uncontrolled or slow movement (dystonia)\n* Epilepsy\n\n**Risks**\n\nDBS is considered safe and effective when done in the right people.\n\nRisks of DBS placement may include:\n\n* Allergic reaction to the DBS parts\n* Problem concentrating\n* Dizziness\n* Infection\n* Leakage of cerebrospinal fluid, which can lead to headache or meningitis\n* Loss of balance, reduced coordination, or slight loss of movement\n* Shock-like sensations\n* Speech or vision problems\n* Temporary pain or swelling at the site where the device was implanted\n* Temporary tingling in the face, arms, or legs\n\n**Possible Risks**\n\nPossible risks of any brain surgery are:\n\n* Blood clot or bleeding in the brain\n* Brain swelling\n* Coma\n* Confusion, usually lasting only for days or weeks at most\n* Infection in the brain, in the wound, or in the skull\n* Problems with speech, memory, muscle weakness, balance, vision, coordination, and other functions, which may be short-term or permanent\n* Seizures\n* Stroke\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nYou will have a complete physical exam.\n\nYour surgeon will order many laboratory and imaging tests, including a CT or MRI scan. These imaging tests are done to help the surgeon pinpoint the exact part of the brain responsible for the symptoms.\n\nYou might have to see more than one specialist, such as a neurologist, neurosurgeon, or psychologist, to make sure that the procedure is right for you and has the best chance of success.\n\nBefore surgery, tell your surgeon:\n\n* If you could be pregnant\n* What medicines you are taking, including herbs, supplements, or vitamins you bought over-the-counter without a prescription\n* If you have been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 or 2 drinks a day\n\n**Planning for Your Surgery**\n\nIf you have diabetes, heart disease, or other medical conditions, your surgeon may ask you to see the provider who treats you for these conditions.\n\nIf you smoke, it's important to cut back or quit. Smoking can slow healing and increase the risk for blood clots. Ask your provider for help quitting smoking.\n\nIf needed, prepare your home to make it easier to recover after surgery.\n\nAsk your surgeon if you need to arrange to have someone drive you home after your surgery.\n\n**During the Week Before Surgery**\n\nYou may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners.\n\nIf you are taking other medicines, ask your surgeon if it is OK to take them on the day of or in the days before surgery.\n\nLet your surgeon know about any illness you may have before your surgery. This includes COVID-19, a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness. If you do get sick, your surgery may need to be postponed.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou may need to stay in the hospital for about 3 days.\n\nYour surgeon may prescribe antibiotics to prevent infection.\n\nYou will return to your surgeon's office at a later date after surgery. During this visit, the stimulator is turned on and the amount of stimulation is adjusted. Surgery is not needed.

Your health care provider may recommend that you do deep breathing exercises.\n\n**How to Breathe Deeply**\n\nMany people feel weak and sore after surgery and taking big breaths can be uncomfortable. Your provider may recommend that you use a device called an incentive spirometer. If you do not have this device, you can still practice deep breathing on your own.\n\nThe following measures may be taken:\n\n* Sit upright. It may help to sit at the edge of the bed with your feet hanging over the side. If you cannot sit like this, raise the head of your bed as high as you can.\n* If your surgical cut (incision) is on your chest or belly, you may need to hold a pillow tightly over your incision. This helps with some of the discomfort.\n* Take a few normal breaths, then take a slow, deep breath in.\n* Hold your breath for about 2 to 5 seconds.\n* Gently and slowly breathe out through your mouth. Make an \"O\" shape with your lips as you blow out, like blowing out birthday candles.\n* Repeat 10 to 15 times, or as many times as your provider told you to.\n\n**Do These Deep-Breathing Exercises As Directed By Your Provider**\n\nAlternative Names\n\n* Lung complications - deep breathing exercises\n* Pneumonia - deep breathing exercises\n\nReferences\n\nYepuri N, Pruekprasert N, Cooney RN.

It has been shown to be beneficial for patients recovering from surgery, as it can help reduce stress, anxiety, and pain.\n\n**Benefits of deep breathing after surgery**\n\n*   Reduces stress and anxiety\n*   Helps manage pain\n*   Improves sleep quality\n*   Enhances recovery process\n\n**How to practice deep breathing**\n\n1.  Find a comfortable position: Sit or lie down in a comfortable position with your back supported.\n2.  Close your eyes: Close your eyes and focus on your breath.\n3.  Inhale deeply: Inhale slowly through your nose, filling your lungs completely.\n4.  Exhale slowly: Exhale slowly through your mouth, emptying your lungs completely.\n5.  Repeat: Repeat the process several times a day.\n\n**Tips for practicing deep breathing after surgery**\n\n*   Practice regularly: Aim to practice deep breathing at least twice a day, ideally in the morning and before bed.\n*   Be consistent: Try to practice deep breathing at the same time every day to make it a habit.\n*   Find a quiet space: Identify a quiet, comfortable space where you can practice deep breathing without distractions.\n\nBy incorporating deep breathing into your daily routine after surgery, you can help reduce stress, manage pain, and enhance your recovery process.",

This is a condition in which a blood clot forms in a vein that is not on or near the surface of the body.\n\nIt mainly affects the large veins in the lower leg and thigh. The clot can block blood flow. If the clot breaks off and moves through the bloodstream, it can get stuck in the blood vessels in the lungs.\n\n**Self-Care**\n\n* Wear pressure stockings if prescribed by your healthcare provider. They may improve blood flow in your legs and lower your risk for long-term complications and problems with blood clots.\n\t+ Avoid letting the stockings become very tight or wrinkled.\n\t+ If you use lotion on your legs, let it dry before putting on the stockings.\n\t+ Put powder on your legs to make it easier to put on the stockings.\n\t+ Wash the stockings each day with mild soap and water. Rinse and let them air dry.\n\t+ Be sure you have a second pair of stockings to wear while the other pair is being washed.\n\t+ If your stockings feel too tight, tell your provider. Do not just stop wearing them.\n\nYour provider may give you medicine to thin your blood to help keep more clots from forming.

Blood clots may form when something slows or changes the flow of blood in the veins. Risk factors include:\n\n*   A pacemaker catheter passed through a vein in the groin\n*   Bed rest or sitting in one position for too long (e.g., plane or car travel)\n*   Family history of blood clots\n*   Fractures in the pelvis or legs\n*   Giving birth within the last 6 months\n*   Pregnancy\n*   Obesity\n*   Recent surgery (most commonly hip, knee, or female pelvic surgery)\n*   Too many blood cells being made by the bone marrow, causing the blood to be thicker than normal (polycythemia vera)\n*   Having an indwelling catheter in a blood vessel\n*   Age greater than 60\n\n**Blood Clotting Disorders**\n\nBlood is more likely to clot in someone who has certain problems or disorders, such as:\n\n*   Cancer\n*   Certain autoimmune disorders, such as lupus\n*   Cigarette smoking\n*   Conditions that make it more likely to develop blood clots\n*   Taking estrogens or birth control pills (this risk is even higher with smoking)\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nDVT mainly affects the large veins in the lower leg and thigh, most often on one side of the body. The clot can block blood flow and cause:\n\n*   Redness of the skin\n*   Skin that feels warm to the touch\n*   Swelling (edema) of a leg or arm\n*   Pain or tenderness in a leg or arm\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. The exam may show a red, swollen, or tender leg.\n\nTests that are often done to diagnose a DVT are:\n\n*   D-dimer blood test\n*   Doppler ultrasound exam of the area of concern\n*   A pelvic or abdominal MRI or CT\n\nBlood tests may be done to check if you have an increased chance of blood clotting, including:\n\n*   Activated protein C resistance (checks for the Factor V Leiden mutation)\n*   Genetic testing for other mutations, such as the prothrombin G20210A mutation\n*   Antithrombin III levels\n*   Antiphospholipid antibodies\n*   Complete blood count (CBC)\n*   Lupus anticoagulant\n*   Protein C and protein S levels\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYour provider will give you medicine to thin your blood (called an anticoagulant). This will keep more clots from forming or old ones from getting bigger.\n\nHeparin is often the first medicine you will receive. If heparin is given through a vein (IV), you must stay in the hospital. However, most people can be treated without staying in the hospital.\n\nLow molecular weight heparin can be given by injection under your skin once or twice a day. You may not need to stay in the hospital as long, or at all, if you are prescribed this type of heparin.\n\nOne type of blood-thinning medicine called warfarin (Coumadin or Jantoven) may be started along with heparin. Warfarin is taken by mouth. It takes several days to fully work.\n\nAnother class of blood thinners are called direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), including:\n\n*   Rivaroxaban (Xarelto)\n*   Apixaban (Eliquis)\n*   Dabigatran (Pradaxa)\n*   Edoxaban (Savaysa)\n\nThese medicines work in a similar way to heparin and can be used right away in place of heparin. Your provider will decide which medicine is right for you.\n\nYou will most likely take a blood thinner for at least 3 months. Some people take it longer, or even for the rest of their lives, depending on their risk for another clot.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of DVT.\n\nGo to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have DVT and you develop:\n\n*   Chest pain\n*   Coughing up blood\n*   Difficulty breathing\n*   Fainting\n*   Loss of consciousness\n*   Other severe symptoms\n\n---\n\n**Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)**\n\nDVT is a condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in a vein deep inside the body.

    "content": "**Deer Velvet**\n\n**What is it?**\nDeer velvet covers the growing bone and cartilage that becomes deer antlers. It's sometimes used as medicine in Western countries.\n\nDeer velvet contains multiple substances including the female sex hormones estrone and estradiol. It also contains substances that might help cells grow and function.\n\nPeople use deer velvet for athletic performance, high blood pressure, increasing sexual desire, asthma, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.\n\n**How effective is it?**\nThere is interest in using deer velvet for a number of purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\n\n**Is it safe?**\nWhen taken by mouth: Deer velvet is possibly safe when used for up to 12 weeks. But there isn't enough reliable information to know what the side effects might be.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\nPregnancy and breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if deer velvet is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n\nHormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: Deer velvet might act like estrogen.

It is also used to treat adults and children 10 years of age and older who have too much iron in their body because of a genetic blood disorder called nonâtransfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT). Deferasirox is in a class of medications called iron chelators. It works by attaching to iron in the body so that it can be excreted (removed from the body) in feces.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nDeferasirox comes as a tablet, granules, and a tablet for suspension (a tablet to dissolve in liquid) to take by mouth. It should be taken on an empty stomach once a day, at least 30 minutes before eating. The tablets and granules can also be taken with a light meal such as a whole wheat English muffin with jelly and skim milk, or a small turkey sandwich on whole wheat bread. Take deferasirox at around the same time every day.\n\nFollow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take deferasirox exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nDifferent deferasirox products are absorbed by the body in different ways and cannot be substituted for one another. If you need to switch from one deferasirox product to another, your doctor may need to adjust your dose. Each time you receive your medication, check to be sure that you have received the deferasirox product that was prescribed for you. Ask your pharmacist if you are not sure that you received the right medication.\n\nSwallow deferasirox tablets (Jadenu) with water or other liquid. If you have trouble swallowing the tablet, you may crush the tablet and mix with a soft food such as yogurt or applesauce immediately before taking. However, do not crush the 90 mg tablet (Jadenu) using a professional crushing device that has jagged edges.\n\nTo take deferasirox granules (Jadenu), sprinkle the granules on a soft food such as yogurt or applesauce immediately before taking.\n\nTo take deferasirox tablets for suspension (Exjade), follow these steps:\n\n* Always dissolve the tablets for suspension in liquid before you take them. Do not chew or swallow the tablets for suspension whole.\n* If you are taking less than 1000 mg of deferasirox, fill a cup halfway (about 3.5 oz/100 mL) with water, apple juice, or orange juice. If you are taking more than 1000 mg of deferasirox, fill a cup (about 7 oz/200 mL) with water, apple juice, or orange juice.\n* Place the number of tablets your doctor has told you to take in the cup.\n* Stir the liquid for 3 minutes to completely dissolve the tablets. The mixture may become thick as you stir it.\n* Drink the liquid immediately.\n* Add a small amount of liquid to the empty cup and stir. Swish the cup to dissolve any medication that is still in the glass or on the stirrer.\n* Drink the rest of the liquid.\n\nYour doctor may adjust your dose of deferasirox not more than once every 3 to 6 months, depending on the results of your laboratory tests.\n\n---\n\n**Deferasirox: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/5)**\n\n\\n\\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nDeferasirox comes as a tablet, granules, and a tablet for suspension (a tablet to dissolve in liquid) to take by mouth.

    "content": "**Defining Overweight and Obesity in Children**\n\nObesity means weighing more than what is healthy for a given height. Obesity is a serious, chronic disease. It can lead to other health problems, including diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers.\n\n**The Rise of Childhood Obesity**\n\nObesity is becoming much more common in childhood. Most often, it begins between the ages of 5 and 6 years and in adolescence.\n\n**Screening for Obesity at a Young Age**\n\nChild health experts recommend that children be screened for obesity at age 2 years. If needed, they should be referred to weight management programs.\n\n**Measuring Body Fat in Children**\n\nYour child's mass index (BMI) is calculated using height and weight. Your health care provider can use BMI to estimate how much body fat your child has.\n\n**Key Differences in Measuring Body Fat in Children**\n\nIn children:\n\n*   The amount of body fat changes with age.\n*   Girls and boys have different amounts of body fat.\n*   A BMI level that says a child has obesity at one age may be normal for a child at a different age.\n\n**Interpreting BMI Levels in Children**\n\nTo determine if a child is overweight or has obesity, experts compare BMI levels of children at the same age to each other. They use a special chart to decide whether a child's weight is healthy or not.\n\n*   If a child's BMI is higher than 85% (85 out of 100) of other children their age and sex, they are considered at risk of being overweight.\n*   If a child's BMI is higher than 95% (95 out of 100) of other children their age and sex, they are considered to be overweight or have obesity.\n\n---\n\n**Defining Overweight and Obesity in Children**\n\nYour health care provider can use BMI to estimate how much body fat your child has.\n\nMeasuring body fat and diagnosing obesity in children is different than measuring these in adults. In children:\n\n*   The amount of body fat changes with age, making it harder to interpret BMI during puberty and periods of rapid growth.\n*   Girls and boys have different amounts of body fat.\n\nA BMI level that says a child has obesity at one age may be normal for a child at a different age.

    "content": "**Delavirdine**\n\n*pronounced as (de la vir' deen)*\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nDelavirdine is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Delavirdine is in a class of medications called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although delavirdine does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nDelavirdine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken three times a day with or without food. Take delavirdine around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take delavirdine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nIf you have trouble swallowing the 100-mg tablets, they may be dispersed in water. To prepare, add four tablets to at least 3 ounces (90 milliliters) of water, allow to stand for a few minutes, and then stir until all tablets dissolve. Drink the delavirdine-water mixture right away. Rinse the glass and swallow the rinse to ensure that you have gotten the entire dose. The 200-mg tablets (which are smaller than the 100-mg tablets) should always be swallowed whole, because they do not readily dissolve in water.\n\nYour doctor may tell you to take delavirdine tablets with orange or cranberry juice if you have certain medical conditions such as achlorhydria (a condition in which stomach has little or no acid). Follow these directions carefully.\n\nDelavirdine may control HIV but will not cure it. Continue to take delavirdine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking delavirdine or any of the other medications that you are taking to treat HIV or AIDS without talking to your doctor. When your supply of delavirdine starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. If you miss doses or stop taking delavirdine, your condition may become more difficult to treat.\n\nAsk your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.\n\n---\n\n**Delavirdine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking delavirdine, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to delavirdine, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in delavirdine tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n\nSome medications should not be taken with delavirdine. Other medications may cause dosing changes or extra monitoring when taken with delavirdine. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before starting delavirdine with your doctor and pharmacist. Before starting, stopping, or changing any medications while taking delavirdine, please get the advice of your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nThe following nonprescription or herbal products may interact with delavirdine: St. John's wort; medications for indigestion, heartburn, or ulcers such as cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec), and ranitidine (Zantac). Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking delavirdine. Do not start any of these medications while taking delavirdine without discussing with your healthcare provider.\n\nIf you are taking didanosine (Videx), take it at least 1 hour before or 1 hour after taking delavirdine. If you are taking antacids, take the antacid at least 1 hour before or 1 hour after taking delavirdine.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had achlorhydria (condition in which stomach has little or no acid) or liver or kidney disease. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you become pregnant while taking delavirdine, call your doctor. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. You should not breast-feed if you are infected with HIV or if you are taking delavirdine.\n\nYou should know that your body fat may increase or move to different areas of your body such as your breasts, upper back and neck, or around the middle of your body. Loss of fat from the legs, arms, and face can also happen.\n\nYou should know that while you are taking medications to treat HIV infection, your immune system may get stronger and begin to fight other infections that were already in your body. This may cause you to develop symptoms of those infections. If you have new or worsening symptoms after starting treatment with delavirdine, be sure to tell your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. If you miss several doses, call your doctor to ask how you should continue taking delavirdine.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nDelavirdine may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* excessive tiredness\n* headache\n* nausea\n* diarrhea\n* rash\n\nSome side effects can be serious. If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop taking delavirdine and call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment:\n\n* rash along with other symptoms such as fever, blistering, sores in the mouth, red or swollen eyes, or muscle or joint pain\n* hives\n* itching\n* swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs\n* hoarseness\n* difficulty breathing or swallowing\n\nDelavirdine may cause other side effects.

    "content": "**Delayed Ejaculation**\n\nDelayed ejaculation is a medical condition in which a male cannot ejaculate easily or at all. It may occur either during intercourse or by manual stimulation with or without a partner. Ejaculation is when semen is released from the penis.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMost men can ejaculate within a few minutes of starting to thrust during intercourse. Men with delayed ejaculation may be unable to ejaculate or may only be able to ejaculate with great effort after having intercourse for a long time (for example, 30 to 45 minutes).\n\nDelayed ejaculation can have psychological or physical causes.\n\n* **Common Psychological Causes:**\n\t+ Religious background that makes the person view sex as sinful\n\t+ Lack of attraction for a partner\n\t+ Conditioning caused by a habit of excessive masturbation\n\t+ Traumatic events (such as being discovered masturbating or having illicit sex, or learning one's partner is having an affair)\n* **Physical Causes:**\n\t+ Blockage of the ducts that semen passes through\n\t+ Use of certain medicines\n\t+ Nervous system diseases, such as stroke or nerve damage to the spinal cord or back\n\t+ Nerve damage during surgery in the pelvis\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nStimulating the penis with a vibrator or other device may determine whether you have a physical problem. This is often a nervous system problem. A nervous system (neurological) exam may reveal other nerve problems that are connected with delayed ejaculation.\n\nAn ultrasound can show a blockage of the ejaculatory ducts.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIf you have never ejaculated through any form of stimulation, see your health care provider to determine if the problem has a physical cause. Your provider may refer you to a urologist for additional evaluation and advice.\n\nSee a therapist who specializes in ejaculation problems if you are unable to ejaculate in an acceptable amount of time. Sex therapy most often includes both partners. In most cases, the therapist will teach you about the sexual response. You also will learn how to communicate and guide your partner to provide the right stimulation.\n\nTherapy often involves a series of \"homework\" assignments. In the privacy of your home, you and your partner engage in sexual activities that reduce performance pressure and focus on pleasure.\n\nTypically, you will not have sexual intercourse for a certain period of time. In this time, you will gradually learn to enjoy ejaculation through other types of stimulation.\n\nIn cases where there is a problem with the relationship or a lack of sexual desire, you may need therapy to improve your relationship and emotional intimacy.\n\nSometimes, hypnosis may be a helpful addition to therapy. This may be useful if one partner is not willing to participate in therapy. Trying to self-treat this problem is often not successful.\n\nIf a medicine may be the cause of the problem, discuss other medicine options with your care provider. Never stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nTreatment commonly requires about 12 to 18 sessions. The average success rate is 70% to 80%.\n\nYou will have a better outcome if:\n\n* You have a past history of satisfying sexual experiences.\n* The problem has not been occurring for a long time.\n* You have feelings of sexual desire.\n* You feel love or attraction toward your sexual partner.\n* You are motivated to get treated.\n* You do not have serious psychological problems.\n\nIf medicines are causing the problem, your provider may recommend switching or stopping the medicine, if possible. A full recovery is possible if this can be done.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nIf the problem is not treated, the following may occur:\n\n* Avoidance of sexual contact\n* Inhibited sexual desire\n* Stress within the relationship\n* Sexual dissatisfaction\n* Difficulty with conception and getting pregnant\n\nIf you and your partner are trying to get pregnant, sperm can be collected using other methods.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nHaving a healthy attitude about your sexuality and genitals helps prevent delayed ejaculation. Realize that you cannot force yourself to have a sexual response, just as you cannot force yourself to go to sleep or to perspire. The harder you try to have a certain sexual response, the harder it may become to respond.\n\nTo reduce the pressure, focus on the pleasure of the moment. Do not worry about whether or when you will ejaculate. Your partner can help by creating a relaxed atmosphere, and by not pressuring you about whether or not you have ejaculated. Openly discuss any fears or anxieties, such as fear of pregnancy or disease, with your partner.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nEjaculatory incompetence; Sex - delayed ejaculation; Anejaculation; Infertility - delayed ejaculation\n\n---\n\n**Delayed Ejaculation**\n\nDelayed ejaculation is a medical condition in which a male cannot ejaculate easily or at all.

This can be caused by various factors, including hormonal imbalances, genetic disorders, and certain medical conditions.\n\n**Causes of delayed puberty**\n\nThe causes of delayed puberty in boys are varied and can include:\n\n*   **Hormonal imbalances**: Abnormal levels of hormones such as testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) can disrupt the pubertal process.\n*   **Genetic disorders**: Certain genetic conditions, such as Klinefelter syndrome, can affect puberty.\n*   **Medical conditions**: Conditions such as hypothyroidism, Cushing's disease, and certain types of cancer can also impact puberty.\n\n**Diagnosing delayed puberty**\n\nDelayed puberty is typically diagnosed through a combination of physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests. These may include:\n\n*   **Physical examination**: A thorough physical exam to assess secondary sexual characteristics.\n*   **Medical history**: A review of the boy's medical history to identify any underlying conditions.\n*   **Laboratory tests**: Blood tests to measure hormone levels, such as testosterone and FSH.\n\n**Treatment options**\n\nThe treatment for delayed puberty depends on the underlying cause. In some cases, no treatment may be necessary, while in others, hormone replacement therapy or other interventions may be required.\n\n**Preventing delayed puberty**\n\nWhile there is no guaranteed way to prevent delayed puberty, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help reduce the risk of hormonal imbalances and other factors that may contribute to delayed puberty. This includes:\n\n*   **Balanced diet**: Eating a well-balanced diet rich in essential nutrients.\n*   **Regular exercise**: Engaging in regular physical activity to promote overall health.\n*   **Stress management**: Practicing stress-reducing techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDelayed puberty is a condition that can have significant emotional and psychological impacts on affected boys. By understanding the causes, diagnosing the condition, and seeking appropriate treatment, boys with delayed puberty can receive the support they need to navigate this challenging period.",

They often come and go. The most common symptoms include:\n\n* Changes in alertness (usually more alert in the morning, less at night)\n* Changing levels of consciousness\n* Confusion\n* Disorganized thinking, talking in a way that doesn't make sense\n* Disrupted sleep patterns, sleepiness\n* Emotional changes: anger, agitation, depression, irritability, overexcitement\n* Hallucinations and delusions\n* Memory problems, especially with short-term memory\n* Trouble concentrating\n\n**Diagnosing Delirium**\n\nYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\n\n* A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms\n* Physical and neurological exams\n* Mental status testing, which checks for problems with your thinking and alertness\n* Lab and diagnostic imaging tests\n\nDelirium and dementia have similar symptoms, so it can be hard to tell them apart. You can also have both at the same time. The differences between them are that:\n\n* Delirium starts suddenly and can cause hallucinations.\n* Dementia develops slowly and does not cause hallucinations.\n\n**Treatments for Delirium**\n\nTreatment of delirium focuses on the causes and symptoms of delirium. The first step is to identify the cause. Often, treating the cause will lead to a full recovery. The recovery may take some time - weeks or sometimes even months. In the meantime, there may be treatments to manage the symptoms, such as:\n\n* Controlling the environment\n* Medicines, including those that control aggression or agitation and pain relievers if there is pain\n\n**Preventing Delirium**\n\nTreating the conditions that can cause delirium may reduce the risk of getting it. Hospitals can help lower the risk of delirium by avoiding sedatives and making sure that hospital rooms are kept quiet, calm, and well-lit. It can also help to have family members around and to have the same staff members treat the person each day (if possible).\n\n---\n\n**Delirium**\n\n**What is Delirium?**\n\nDelirium is a mental state in which you are confused, disoriented, and not able to think or remember clearly. It usually starts suddenly. It is often temporary and treatable.\n\n**Types of Delirium**\n\nThere are three types of delirium:\n\n* **Hypoxic delirium**: caused by lack of oxygen\n* **Metabolic delirium**: caused by diabetes, kidney disease, or other metabolic disorders\n* **Substance-induced delirium**: caused by use of certain medications or substances\n\n**Causes of Delirium**\n\nThere are many different problems that can cause delirium. Some of the more common causes include:\n\n* Certain factors put you at risk for delirium, including:\n\t+ Age: older adults are more likely to develop delirium\n\t+ Medical conditions: such as diabetes, kidney disease, or heart disease\n\t+ Medications: certain medications can cause delirium\n\t+ Substance use: use of certain substances can cause delirium\n\n**Symptoms of Delirium**\n\nThe symptoms of delirium usually start suddenly, over a few hours or a few days. They often come and go. The most common symptoms include:\n\n* Confusion\n* Disorientation\n* Difficulty thinking or remembering clearly\n* Hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not there)\n* Agitation or aggression\n\n**Treatment of Delirium**\n\nTreatment of delirium focuses on the causes and symptoms of delirium. The first step is to identify the cause. Often, treating the cause will lead to a full recovery. The recovery may take some time - weeks or sometimes even months.

Many disorders may cause delirium. Often, these disorders do not allow the brain to get oxygen or other substances. They may also cause dangerous chemicals (toxins) to build up in the brain. Delirium is common in the intensive care unit (ICU), especially in older adults.\n\nCauses include:\n\n*   Alcohol or medicine overdose or withdrawal\n*   Drug use or overdose, including being sedated in the ICU\n*   Electrolyte or other body chemical disturbances\n*   Infections such as urinary tract infections, pneumonia, or meningitis\n*   Severe lack of sleep\n*   Poisons\n*   General anesthesia and surgery\n*   Autoimmune disease\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nDelirium involves a quick change between mental states (for example, from lethargy to agitation and back to lethargy).\n\nSymptoms include:\n\n*   Changes in alertness (usually more alert in the morning, less alert at night)\n*   Changes in feeling (sensation) and perception\n*   Changes in level of consciousness or awareness\n*   Changes in movement (for example, may be slow moving or hyperactive)\n*   Changes in sleep patterns, drowsiness\n*   Confusion (disorientation) about time or place\n*   Decrease in short-term memory and recall\n*   Disorganized thinking, such as talking in a way that doesn't make sense\n*   Emotional or personality changes, such as anger, agitation, depression, irritability, and overly happy\n*   Incontinence\n*   Movements triggered by changes in the nervous system\n*   Problem concentrating\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe following tests may have abnormal results:\n\n*   An examination of the nervous system (neurologic examination), including tests of feeling (sensation), mental status, thinking (cognitive function), and motor function\n*   Neuropsychological studies\n\nThe following tests may also be done:\n\n*   Blood and urine tests\n*   Chest x-ray\n*   Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis (spinal tap, or lumbar puncture)\n*   Electroencephalogram (EEG)\n*   Head CT scan\n*   Head MRI scan\n*   Mental status test\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to control or reverse the cause of the symptoms.

Acute brain syndromes may be reversible by treating the cause.\n\nDelirium often lasts about 1 week. It may take several weeks for mental function to return to normal. Full recovery is usually expected, but depends on the underlying cause of the delirium.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nProblems that may result from delirium include:\n\n*   **Loss of ability to function or care for self**\n*   **Loss of ability to interact**\n*   **Progression to stupor or coma**\n*   **Side effects of medicines used to treat the disorder**\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if there is a rapid change in mental status.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTreating the conditions that cause delirium can reduce its risk. In hospitalized people, avoiding or using a low dosage of sedatives, prompt treatment of metabolic disorders and infections, and using reality orientation programs will reduce the risk of delirium in those at high risk.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nAcute confusional state; Acute brain syndrome\n\n**Images**\n\n*   Central nervous system and peripheral nervous system\n*   Brain\n\n**References**\n\nInouye SK.
