This can lead to accidents and the loss of dignity for the child.\n\n**Causes of Encopresis**\n\nThe exact cause of encopresis is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to a combination of factors, including:\n\n*   Constipation: A buildup of hard stool in the intestines that can lead to discomfort and difficulty passing stools.\n*   Delayed toilet training: Children who are potty-trained later than their peers may be more prone to encopresis.\n*   Emotional issues: Children with emotional problems, such as anxiety or depression, may be more likely to experience encopresis.\n\n**Symptoms of Encopresis**\n\nThe symptoms of encopresis can vary depending on the individual child, but common signs include:\n\n*   Accidents during the day or night\n*   Difficulty controlling bowel movements\n*   Constipation or hard stools\n*   Pain or discomfort while passing stools\n\n**Treatment Options for Encopresis**\n\nTreatment for encopresis typically involves a combination of medical and behavioral interventions. Some possible treatment options include:\n\n*   Laxatives: Medications that help soften and move stool through the intestines.\n*   Stool softeners: Medications that help make stool easier to pass.\n*   Dietary changes: Increasing fiber intake and staying hydrated can help regulate bowel movements.\n*   Behavioral therapy: Working with a therapist to address underlying emotional issues.\n\n**Preventing Encopresis**\n\nWhile there is no guaranteed way to prevent encopresis, some strategies may help reduce the risk of developing this condition. These include:\n\n*   Early toilet training: Teaching children to use the bathroom at an early age can help them develop good bowel habits.\n*   Regular exercise: Engaging in regular physical activity can help regulate bowel movements and reduce the risk of constipation.\n*   A balanced diet: Eating a healthy, fiber-rich diet can help prevent constipation and promote regular bowel movements.\n\n**When to Seek Medical Attention**\n\nIf you suspect that your child may have encopresis, it is essential to seek medical attention. Your pediatrician can assess your child's symptoms and develop a treatment plan tailored to their needs. In some cases, further evaluation by a specialist, such as a gastroenterologist or psychologist, may be necessary to identify underlying causes of the condition.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Kliegman RM, St. Geme JW, Blum NJ, et al.

You may need to stay on a special diet or take medicines to help your body work well.\n\nDIALYSIS\n\nDialysis does some of the job of the kidneys when they stop working well.\n\nDialysis can:\n\n* Remove extra salt, water, and waste products so they do not build up in your body\n* Keep safe levels of minerals and vitamins in your body\n* Help control blood pressure\n* Help the body make red blood cells\n\nYour provider will discuss dialysis with you before you need it. Dialysis removes waste from your blood when your kidneys can no longer do their job.\n\nUsually, you will go on dialysis when you have only 10% to 15% of your kidney function left.\nEven people who are waiting for a kidney transplant may need dialysis while waiting.\n\nTwo different methods are used to perform dialysis:\n\n* During hemodialysis, your blood passes through a tube into an artificial kidney, or filter. This method can be done at home or at a dialysis center.\n* During peritoneal dialysis, a special solution passes into your belly though a catheter tube. The solution remains in your abdomen for period of time and then is removed. This method can be done at home, at work, or while traveling.\n\nKIDNEY TRANSPLANT\n\nA kidney transplant is surgery to place a healthy kidney into a person with kidney failure. Your provider will refer you to a transplant center. There, you will be seen and evaluated by the transplant team. They will want to make sure that you are a good candidate for kidney transplant.\n\nSPECIAL DIET\n\nYou may need to continue following a special diet for chronic kidney disease. The diet may include:\n\n* Eating foods low in protein to limit your total daily protein intake\n* Getting enough calories if you are losing weight\n* Limiting fluids\n* Limiting salt, potassium, phosphorous, and other electrolytes\n\nOTHER TREATMENT\n\nOther treatment depends on your symptoms, but may include:\n\n* Extra calcium and vitamin D. (Always talk to your provider before taking supplements.)\n* Medicines called phosphate binders, to help prevent blood phosphorous levels from becoming too high.\n* Treatment for anemia, such as extra iron in the diet, iron pills or shots, shots of a medicine called erythropoietin, and blood transfusions.\n* Medicines to control your blood pressure.\n\nTalk to your provider about vaccinations that you may need, including:\n\n* Hepatitis A vaccine\n* Hepatitis B vaccine\n* COVID-19 vaccine\n* Flu vaccine\n* Pneumonia vaccine (PPV)\n\n---\n\n**End-stage kidney disease: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 4/4)**\n\n**Treatment**\n\n*   Medicines to control your blood pressure.\n*   Shots of a medicine called erythropoietin, and blood transfusions.\n\n**Vaccinations**\n\nTalk to your provider about vaccinations that you may need, including:\n\n*   Hepatitis A vaccine\n*   Hepatitis B vaccine\n*   COVID-19 vaccine\n*   Flu vaccine\n*   Pneumonia vaccine (PPV)\n\n**Dialysis or Kidney Transplant**\n\nESRD may need to be treated with dialysis or kidney transplant.

    "content": "**Ending Pregnancy with Medicines**\n\nSome women prefer the use of medicines to terminate a pregnancy because:\n\n*   It may be used in early pregnancy.\n*   It may be used at home.\n*   It feels more natural, like a miscarriage.\n*   It is less invasive than an in-clinic abortion.\n\nMedicines can be used to end an early pregnancy. In many cases, the first day of your last period must be less than 11 weeks ago. If you are over 11 weeks pregnant, you may need to have an in-clinic abortion. Some clinics will go beyond 11 weeks for a medicine abortion.\n\n**Who Should Not Have a Medication Abortion**\n\nYou should not have a medication abortion if you:\n\n*   Are over 11 weeks pregnant (time since the start of your last period).\n*   Have a blood clotting disorder or adrenal failure.\n*   Have an IUD. It must be removed first.\n*   Are allergic to the medicines that are used to end pregnancy.\n*   Take any medicines that should not be used with a medication abortion.\n*   Do not have access to a health care provider or an emergency room.\n\n**Getting Ready for a Medication Abortion**\n\nThe provider will:\n\n*   Do a physical exam and ultrasound\n*   Go over your medical history\n*   Do blood and urine tests\n*   Explain how the abortion medicines work\n*   Have you sign consent forms\n\n**What Happens During a Medication Abortion**\n\nYou may take the following medicines for the abortion:\n\n*   Mifepristone - this is called the abortion pill or RU-486\n*   Misoprostol\n*   You will also take antibiotics to prevent infection\n\nOften, you will take mifepristone in the provider's office or clinic but some providers may allow you to take it at home. This stops the hormone progesterone from working. The lining of the uterus breaks down so the pregnancy cannot continue.\n\nThe provider will tell you when and how to take the misoprostol. It will be about 6 to 72 hours after taking mifepristone. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract and empty.\n\n**After Taking the Medicines**\n\nYou may feel a lot of pain and cramping. You will have heavy bleeding and see blood clots and tissue come out of your vagina. This most often takes 3 to 5 hours. The amount will be more than you have with your period. This means the medicines are working.\n\nYou may also have nausea, and you may vomit, have a fever, chills, diarrhea, and a headache.\n\nYou can take pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) to help with the pain. Do not take aspirin. Expect to have light vaginal bleeding for up to 4 weeks after a medication abortion. You will need to have pads to wear. Plan to take it easy for a few weeks.\n\nYou should avoid vaginal intercourse for about a week after a medication abortion. You can get pregnant soon after an abortion, so talk with your provider about what birth control to use. Make sure you are using an effective contraception before you resume sexual activity. You should get your regular period in about 4 to 8 weeks.\n\n**Follow up with Your Health Care Provider**\n\nMake a follow-up appointment with your provider. You need to be checked to make sure the abortion was complete and that you are not having any problems. In case it did not work, you will need to have an in-clinic abortion.\n\n**Risks to Ending Pregnancy with Medicine**\n\nMost women have a medication abortion safely. There are a few risks, but most can be treated easily:\n\n*   An incomplete abortion is when part of the pregnancy does not come out. You will need to have an in-clinic abortion to complete the abortion.\n*   Heavy bleeding\n*   Infection\n*   Blood clots in your uterus\n\nMedication abortions are typically very safe. In most cases, it does not affect your ability to have children unless you have a rare serious complication.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nSerious problems must be treated right away for your safety. Call your provider if you have:\n\n*   Heavy bleeding - you are soaking through 2 pads every hour for 2 hours\n*   Blood clots for 2 hours or more, or if the clots are larger than a lemon\n*   Signs that you are still pregnant\n\nYou should also call your provider if you have signs of infection:\n\n*   Bad pain in your stomach or back\n*   A fever over 100.4°F (38°C) or any fever for 24 hours\n*   Vomiting or diarrhea for more than 24 hours after taking the pills\n*   Bad smelling vaginal discharge\n\n---\n\n**Ending Pregnancy with Medicines**\n\n**What Happens During a Medication Abortion**\n\nYou may take the following medicines for the abortion:\n\n*   Mifepristone - this is called the abortion pill or RU-486\n*   Misoprostol\n*   You will also take antibiotics to prevent infection\n\nOften, you will take mifepristone in the provider's office or clinic but some providers may allow you to take it at home. This stops the hormone progesterone from working. The lining of the uterus breaks down so the pregnancy cannot continue.\n\nThe provider will tell you when and how to take the misoprostol. It will be about 6 to 72 hours after taking mifepristone. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract and empty.\n\nAfter taking the second medicine, you will feel a lot of pain and cramping. You will have heavy bleeding and see blood clots and tissue come out of your vagina. This most often takes 3 to 5 hours. The amount will be more than you have with your period. This means the medicines are working.\n\nYou may also have nausea, and you may vomit, have a fever, chills, diarrhea, and a headache.\n\nYou can take pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) to help with the pain.

You should get your regular period in about 4 to 8 weeks.\n\n---\n\n**Ending Pregnancy with Medicines**\n\nIf you're considering ending your pregnancy with medicines, it's essential to understand the process and potential risks involved.\n\n**When to Use Medication Abortion**\n\nMedication abortion is typically used for early pregnancies, where the first day of your last period must be less than 11 weeks ago. If you're over 11 weeks pregnant, you may need to have an in-clinic abortion. Some clinics will go beyond 11 weeks for a medicine abortion.\n\n**Be Very Certain**\n\nIt's crucial to be very certain that you want to end your pregnancy. It's not safe to stop the medicines once you've started taking them. Doing so creates a very high risk for severe birth defects.\n\n**Who Should Not Have a Medication Abortion**\n\nYou should not have a medication abortion if:\n\n* You're over 11 weeks pregnant\n* You have a rare serious complication\n\n**Getting Ready for a Medication Abortion**\n\nThe provider will:\n\n* Explain the process and potential risks involved\n* Ensure you understand the importance of taking the medicines as directed\n\n**What Happens During a Medication Abortion**\n\nYou may take the following medicines for the abortion:\n\n1. Mifepristone: This stops the hormone progesterone from working, causing the lining of the uterus to break down.\n2. Misoprostol: Taken 6 to 72 hours after mifepristone, this causes the uterus to contract and empty.\n\nAfter taking the second medicine, you will feel a lot of pain and cramping. You will have heavy bleeding and see blood clots and tissue come out of your vagina. This most often takes 3 to 5 hours.\n\n**Risks and Side Effects**\n\nMost women have a medication abortion safely. However, there are some risks and side effects to be aware of:\n\n* Blood clots for 2 hours or more, or if the clots are larger than a lemon\n* Bad pain in your stomach or back\n* Fever over 100.4°F (38°C) or any fever for 24 hours\n* Vomiting or diarrhea for more than 24 hours after taking the pills\n* Bad smelling vaginal discharge\n\n**Follow Up with Your Health Care Provider**\n\nMake a follow-up appointment with your provider to ensure the abortion was complete and you're not experiencing any problems.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nSerious problems must be treated right away for your safety. Call your provider if you have:\n\n* Severe bleeding or pain\n* Signs of infection (bad pain in your stomach or back, fever over 100.4°F, vomiting or diarrhea)\n* Rare serious complications\n\nRemember, medication abortion is typically very safe. However, it's essential to be aware of the potential risks and side effects involved.",

These cushions are two thicker areas that develop into the walls (septum) that divide the four chambers of the heart.\n\n\\n\\n**Causes and Symptoms**\n\nECD occurs while a baby is still growing in the womb (uterus). The lack of separation between the two sides of the heart causes several problems:\n\n*   Increased blood flow to the lungs, resulting in increased pressure in the lungs\n*   Heart failure, causing swelling in the baby, problems in breathing, and difficulty in feeding and growing\n*   Cyanosis, or bluish skin, due to oxygen-poor blood mixing with oxygen-rich blood\n\nThere are two types of ECD:\n\n*   Complete ECD: This condition involves an atrial septal defect (ASD) and a ventricular septal defect (VSD). People with a complete ECD have only one large heart valve (common AV valve) instead of two distinct valves (mitral and tricuspid).\n*   Partial (or incomplete) ECD: In this condition, only an ASD, or an ASD and VSD are present. There are two distinct valves, but one of them (the mitral valve) is often abnormal with an opening (cleft) in it.\n\nECD may be associated with other congenital heart defects, such as:\n\n*   Double outlet right ventricle\n*   Single ventricle\n*   Transposition of the great vessels\n*   Tetralogy of Fallot\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of ECD may include:\n\n*   Tires easily\n*   Bluish skin color (cyanosis)\n*   Feeding difficulties\n*   Failure to gain weight and grow\n*   Frequent pneumonia or infections\n*   Pale skin (pallor)\n*   Rapid breathing\n*   Rapid heartbeat\n*   Sweating\n*   Swollen legs or abdomen (rare in children)\n*   Trouble breathing, especially during feeding\n\n\\n\\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nDuring an exam, your child's health care provider will likely find signs of ECD, including:\n\n*   An abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG)\n*   An enlarged heart\n*   Heart murmur\n\nTests to diagnose ECD include:\n\n*   Echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound that views the heart structures and blood flow inside the heart\n*   ECG, which measures the electrical activity of the heart\n*   Chest x-ray, which produces an image of the heart and large arteries\n*   MRI, which provides a detailed image of the heart\n*   Cardiac catheterization, a procedure in which a thin tube (catheter) is placed into the heart to see blood flow and take accurate measurements of blood pressure and oxygen levels\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment**\n\nSurgery is needed to close the holes between the heart chambers, and to create distinct tricuspid and mitral valves.

Some risk factors include:\n\n*   Family history\n*   Genetic syndromes such as Down syndrome\n*   Exposure to certain toxins during pregnancy\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of endocardial cushion defects may not appear until later in life, and can include:\n\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Fatigue\n*   Chest pain or palpitations\n*   Coughing up blood (in severe cases)\n\n\\n\\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis is typically made using echocardiogram or other imaging tests.\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment depends on the severity of the defect and may include:\n\n*   Surgery to repair or replace the defective heart valve\n*   Medications to manage symptoms\n*   Lifestyle changes such as avoiding strenuous exercise\n\n\\n\\n**Prognosis**\n\nWith proper treatment, most people with endocardial cushion defects can lead normal lives. However, some may experience complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.\n\n\\n\\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   Congenital Heart Defects\n*   Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)\n*   Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)\n\n\\n\\n**Images**\n\n*   Ventricular septal defect\n*   Atrial septal defect\n*   Atrioventricular canal (endocardial cushion defect)",

It's usually caused by germs that get into your bloodstream and travel to your heart.\n\n**Causes of Endocarditis**\n\nBacterial infections cause most endocarditis. Normally, many bacteria live in your mouth, on your skin, or in other parts of the body. Sometimes the bacteria can get into your bloodstream from injuries such as cuts or scrapes. Dental work and certain surgeries can also allow small amounts of bacteria to enter your bloodstream.\n\nIn some cases, fungal infections cause endocarditis. The fungi, such as yeast, can live in parts of your body. Fungal infections generally happen in people who have weakened immune systems that can't stop the fungus from growing. This includes people who have HIV.\n\n**Who is More Likely to Develop Endocarditis?**\n\nIn general, endocarditis is rare. If you're healthy, your immune system usually destroys the germs in your bloodstream before they can cause harm.\n\nBut your chance of developing endocarditis may be higher than most people if you:\n\n* Have certain heart conditions, such as heart valve disease or congenital heart defects.\n* Are older and have age-related changes to the heart valves.\n* Inject illegal drugs using unclean needles.\n* Have a condition that weakens your immune system.\n* Don't take care of your teeth and gums.\n* Have a long-term central venous line.\n* Have already had endocarditis.\n\n**Symptoms of Endocarditis**\n\nEndocarditis symptoms may be severe or very mild. They may start suddenly or slowly. And they can vary from person to person. The possible symptoms of endocarditis include:\n\n* Fever and chills\n* New or worsening heart murmur (an unusual sound heard between heartbeats)\n* Chest pain\n* Cough\n* Muscle, joint, and back pain\n* Night sweats (heavy sweating during sleep)\n* Shortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air)\n\n**Problems Caused by Endocarditis**\n\nWhen the germs are in your heart, they can clump together with blood cells. These clumps can break off and travel through your bloodstream. They may block blood flow, spread infection, or damage your organs, including your brain, lungs, kidneys, and spleen.\n\nEndocarditis may sometimes lead to sepsis, a medical emergency that happens when your body has an extreme response to the infection.\n\n**Diagnosis of Endocarditis**\n\nTo find out if you have endocarditis, your health care provider will:\n\n* Ask about your medical history, including your symptoms, recent illnesses, and other health conditions that affect your chance of developing endocarditis.\n* Do a physical exam.\n* Likely order tests, such as blood tests to check for signs of infection, bacteria, or fungi in your blood.\n\n**Treatment of Endocarditis**\n\nIf you have endocarditis, it's important to get treatment quickly. Treatments may include:\n\n* Medicines:\n\t+ Antibiotics to treat bacterial infections.\n\t+ Antifungal medicine to treat fungal infections.\n* Heart surgery may be needed to repair or replace damaged valves and heart tissue.\n\n**Prevention of Endocarditis**\n\nIf you have a higher chance of developing endocarditis than most people, you can reduce your risk if you:\n\n* Take good care of your teeth and gums every day\n* Have dental exams and cleaning at your dentist's office every 6 months\n* Make heart-healthy habits part of your daily life to help prevent heart disease\n\n---\n\n**Endocarditis | Infective Endocarditis | IE**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is endocarditis?**\n\nEndocarditis is a rare but life-threatening inflammation of the lining inside your heart's chambers and valves (the endocardium).

If you're healthy, your immune system usually destroys the germs in your bloodstream before they can cause harm.\n\nBut your chance of developing endocarditis may be higher than most people if you:\n\n* Have certain heart conditions. Damaged or abnormal heart tissue and devices in your heart can trap germs more easily than healthy heart tissue.\n* Are older. Age-related changes to the heart valves, such as mitral valve prolapse or calcium deposits in the aortic valve, create places for germs to attach to the heart.\n* Inject illegal drugs. Unclean needles may carry bacteria into the bloodstream.\n* Have a condition that weakens your immune system.\n* Don't take care of your teeth and gums. Poor dental health makes it easier for germs to get into your bloodstream through your gums and mouth.\n* Have a long-term central venous line, a tube that stays in a large vein for weeks or months for medical treatment.\n* Have already had endocarditis. Endocarditis can damage heart tissue, which increases your risk of getting it again.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the symptoms of endocarditis?**\n\nEndocarditis symptoms may be severe or very mild. They may start suddenly or slowly. And they can vary from person to person. The possible symptoms of endocarditis include:\n\n* Fever and chills\n* New or worsening heart murmur (an unusual sound heard between heartbeats)\n* Chest pain\n* Cough\n* Muscle, joint, and back pain\n* Night sweats (heavy sweating during sleep)\n* Shortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air)\n* Skin changes, including:\n\t+ Broken blood vessels\n\t+ Painful red or purple bumps\n\t+ Painless flat red spots on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What other problems can endocarditis cause?**\n\nWhen the germs are in your heart, they can clump together with blood cells.

They may block blood flow, spread infection, or damage your organs, including your brain, lungs, kidneys, and spleen.\n\nEndocarditis may sometimes lead to sepsis, a medical emergency that happens when your body has an extreme response to the infection.\n\nEndocarditis can also cause serious heart problems including:\n\n* Heart valve damage\n* Heart failure\n* Arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is endocarditis diagnosed?**\n\nTo find out if you have endocarditis, your health care provider will:\n\n* Ask about your medical history, including your symptoms, recent illnesses, and other health conditions that affect your chance of developing endocarditis.\n* Do a physical exam.\n* Likely order tests, such as:\n\t+ Blood tests to check for signs of infection, bacteria, or fungi in your blood.\n\t+ Chest x-rays.\n\t+ Heart tests.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the treatments for endocarditis?**\n\nIf you have endocarditis, it's important to get treatment quickly. Treatments may include:\n\n* Medicines:\n\t+ Antibiotics to treat bacterial infections. Antibiotics are usually started through an intravenous (IV) line in the hospital.\n\t+ Antifungal medicine to treat fungal infections. Your provider may suggest taking antifungal medicine for the rest of your life to prevent the infection from coming back.\n* Heart surgery may be needed to repair or replace damaged valves and heart tissue. Surgery may also be done to remove infected tissue.\n* Dental care, especially cleanings, can help reduce the amount of bacteria that grows in your mouth.\n\nTreatment may last weeks, and you may need tests to make sure it's working. Your provider will also check you for problems that could develop from endocarditis, such as heart failure or an irregular heartbeat.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Can endocarditis be prevented?**\n\nIf you have a higher chance of developing endocarditis than most people, you can reduce your risk if you:\n\n* Take good care of your teeth and gums every day\n* Have dental exams and cleaning at your dentist's office every 6 months\n* Make heart-healthy habits part of your daily life to help prevent heart disease\n* Call your health care provider right away if you have symptoms that could be endocarditis\n\nPeople with the highest risk for bacterial endocarditis need antibiotics before dental visits or certain medical or surgical procedures.

    "content": "**Endocrine Disorders**\n\n**Your Endocrine System**\n\nYour endocrine system includes eight major glands throughout your body. These glands make hormones, which are chemical messengers that travel through your bloodstream to tissues or organs.\n\n**Hormones and Their Functions**\n\nHormones work slowly and affect body processes from head to toe. The functions of hormones include:\n\n*   Growth and development\n*   Metabolism - digestion, elimination, breathing, blood circulation, and maintaining body temperature\n*   Sexual function\n*   Reproduction\n*   Mood\n\n**Understanding Hormone Disorders**\n\nIf your hormone levels are too high or too low, you may have a hormone disorder. Hormone diseases also occur if your body does not respond to hormones the way it is supposed to. Stress, infection, and changes in your blood's fluid and electrolyte balance can also influence hormone levels.\n\n**Common Endocrine Diseases**\n\nIn the United States, the most common endocrine disease is diabetes. Other endocrine diseases include:\n\n*   Carney Complex (CNC)\n*   Hyperinsulinemia: Is it diabetes?\n*   Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Syndromes (MEN)\n*   Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome\n\n**Genetic Disorders**\n\nSome endocrine disorders have a genetic component, including:\n\n*   17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiency\n*   46,XX testicular difference of sex development\n*   5-alpha reductase deficiency\n*   Aromatase deficiency\n*   Aromatase excess syndrome\n*   Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy\n*   Central precocious puberty\n*   Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency\n*   Familial male-limited precocious puberty\n*   Isolated growth hormone deficiency\n*   Kallmann syndrome\n*   Leydig cell hypoplasia\n*   McCune-Albright syndrome\n*   Multiple endocrine neoplasia\n*   Swyer syndrome\n*   Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome\n\n**Learning More**\n\nTo learn more about endocrine disorders, you can:\n\n*   Watch videos and tutorials on the topic\n*   Read journal articles and research papers\n*   Consult with an expert in the field\n*   Learn more about specific endocrine diseases and genetic disorders\n\n---\n\n**Endocrine Disorders**\n\nHormones are chemical messengers that travel through your bloodstream to tissues or organs, working slowly to affect body processes from head to toe.\n\n**Causes of Hormone Disorders**\n\nIf your hormone levels are too high or too low, you may have a hormone disorder. Hormone diseases also occur if your body does not respond to hormones the way it is supposed to. Stress, infection and changes in your blood's fluid and electrolyte balance can also influence hormone levels.\n\n**Common Endocrine Diseases**\n\nIn the United States, the most common endocrine disease is diabetes. There are many others. They are usually treated by controlling how much hormone your body makes. Hormone supplements can help if the problem is too little of a hormone.\n\n**Your Endocrine System**\n\nYour endocrine system includes eight major glands throughout your body. These glands make hormones, which are chemical messengers that travel through your bloodstream to tissues or organs.\n\n**Genetics and Hormones**\n\nSome hormone disorders have a genetic component. For example, 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that affects hormone production.\n\n**Related Issues**\n\nEndocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are substances that can interfere with hormone function in the body. Understanding EDCs and their impact on human health is an important area of research.\n\n**Specific Hormone Disorders**\n\nCarney complex, hyperinsulinemia, multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome are all specific hormone disorders that have distinct symptoms and treatments.\n\n**Genetic Conditions Affecting Hormones**\n\nAutoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy, central precocious puberty, familial male-limited precocious puberty, isolated growth hormone deficiency, Kallmann syndrome, Leydig cell hypoplasia, McCune-Albright syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia, Swyer syndrome, and Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome are all genetic conditions that affect hormone production or function.\n\n**Videos and Tutorials**\n\nThe medical encyclopedia has a video on endocrine glands, which can help explain how the endocrine system works.\n\n**Statistics and Research**\n\nResearch on hormones and hormone disorders is ongoing. For example, studies have investigated the impact of bisphenol A (BPA) on human health.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nClinical trials are being conducted to investigate new treatments for endocrine diseases. You can search for clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nRecent journal articles have explored topics such as assessing the impact of PCSK9 and HMGCR inhibitor on reproductive endocrine disorders, comparative analysis of adverse event profiles of lanreotide and octreotide in patients with neuroendocrine tumors, and the relationship between mpox infection and endocrine health.\n\n---\n\n**Endocrine Disorders**\n\n**Tor on Reproductive Endocrine...**\n\n*   Comparative analysis of adverse event profiles of lanreotide and octreotide in...\n*   Mpox Infection and Endocrine Health: Bridging the Knowledge Gap.\n\n**Endocrine Diseases**\n\n*   See more articles\n*   Reference Desk\n    *   Endocrine Diseases  (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases)\n        Reference Desk\n\n**Find an Expert**\n\n*   Find an Endocrinologist (Endocrine Society)\n*   National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n*   Find an Expert\n\n**Children**\n\n*   Childhood Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) Syndromes Treatment  (National Cancer Institute)\n    *   Also in Spanish\n*   Your Endocrine System (For Kids) (Nemours Foundation)\n    *   Also in Spanish\n\n**Teenagers**\n\n*   Endocrine System (For Teens) (Nemours Foundation)\n    *   Also in Spanish\n\n**Men**\n\n*   Hypogonadism in Men (Endocrine Society)\n*   Male Hypogonadism (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research)\n    *   Also in Spanish\n\n**Patient Handouts**\n\n*   Differences of sex development (Medical Encyclopedia)\n    *   Also in Spanish\n*   Endocrine glands (Medical Encyclopedia)\n    *   Also in Spanish\n*   Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Medical Encyclopedia)\n    *   Also in Spanish\n*   Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I (Medical Encyclopedia)\n    *   Also in Spanish\n*   Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) II (Medical Encyclopedia)\n    *   Also in Spanish\n*   Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (Medical Encyclopedia)\n    *   Also in Spanish\n\n**Topic Image**\n\n*   MEDICAL ENCYCLOPEDIA\n    *   Differences of sex development\n    *   Endocrine glands\n    *   Gastrin blood test\n    *   Glucagon blood test\n    *   Hypogonadism\n    *   Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism\n    *   LH response to GnRH blood test\n    *   McCune-Albright syndrome\n    *   Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   Addison Disease\n*   Adrenal Gland Disorders\n*   Diabetes\n*   Growth Disorders\n*   Hormones\n*   Pancreatic Diseases\n*   Parathyroid Disorders\n*   Pituitary Disorders\n*   Thyroid Diseases",

They help regulate various bodily functions, such as growth and development, metabolism, and reproductive processes.\n    *   There are two main types of hormones: steroid hormones and peptide hormones. Steroid hormones, like cortisol and aldosterone, are derived from cholesterol and play a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis. Peptide hormones, on the other hand, are composed of amino acids and include hormones like insulin and oxytocin.\n    *   Hormones can be classified based on their function, such as anabolic hormones (e.g., testosterone) that promote growth and development, or catabolic hormones (e.g., glucagon) that break down complex molecules into simpler ones.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **How to Prevent Diabetes**\n    *   Preventing diabetes involves a combination of lifestyle changes and maintaining good overall health. Some strategies for preventing diabetes include:\n        1.  Maintaining a healthy weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise.\n        2.  Engaging in physical activity regularly, such as walking or other aerobic exercises.\n        3.  Following a healthy eating plan that emphasizes whole foods, fruits, vegetables, and lean protein sources.\n        4.  Limiting sugar intake and avoiding sugary drinks.\n        5.  Getting enough sleep each night to help regulate blood sugar levels.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Islet Cell Transplantation**\n    *   Islet cell transplantation is a surgical procedure that involves transplanting healthy islet cells from a donor into the liver of a person with type 1 diabetes. The goal of this procedure is to restore normal insulin production and improve blood sugar control.\n    *   This treatment option is typically considered for individuals who have not responded well to other treatments or who are experiencing severe complications related to their diabetes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Pancreas Transplantation**\n    *   Pancreas transplantation involves transplanting a healthy pancreas from a donor into the body of a person with type 1 diabetes. This procedure can help restore normal insulin production and improve blood sugar control.\n    *   Like islet cell transplantation, pancreas transplantation is typically considered for individuals who have not responded well to other treatments or who are experiencing severe complications related to their diabetes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Pancreatic Cancer**\n    *   Pancreatic cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the pancreas, an organ responsible for producing hormones and digestive enzymes. This disease can be aggressive and often goes undetected until it has reached an advanced stage.\n    *   Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include smoking, family history, age, and certain genetic mutations.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Pancreatic Diseases**\n    *   Pancreatic diseases refer to a range of conditions that affect the pancreas, including pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), pancreatic cancer, and other disorders.\n    *   Symptoms of pancreatic disease may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and changes in bowel movements.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Prediabetes**\n    *   Prediabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. This condition can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and other health problems if left untreated.\n    *   Risk factors for prediabetes include obesity, physical inactivity, family history, and certain ethnic backgrounds.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **The Pituitary Gland**\n    *   The pituitary gland is a small endocrine gland located at the base of the brain. It plays a crucial role in regulating various bodily functions, including growth and development, metabolism, and reproductive processes.\n    *   The pituitary gland produces several hormones that stimulate or inhibit the production of other hormones in the body.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Diabetes Insipidus**\n    *   Diabetes insipidus is a rare condition characterized by an inability to regulate fluids in the body. This can lead to excessive thirst and urination.\n    *   The condition is often caused by a deficiency in antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or a problem with the kidneys' ability to respond to ADH.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Dwarfism**\n    *   Dwarfism, also known as short stature, refers to a range of conditions characterized by an unusually small adult height.\n    *   Causes of dwarfism can include genetic mutations, hormonal imbalances, and certain medical conditions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Endocrine Diseases**\n    *   Endocrine diseases refer to a range of conditions that affect the endocrine system, including disorders related to hormone production and regulation.\n    *   Examples of endocrine diseases include diabetes, hypothyroidism, and Cushing's syndrome.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Growth Disorders**\n    *   Growth disorders refer to a range of conditions that affect growth and development in children and adolescents.\n    *   Causes of growth disorders can include genetic mutations, hormonal imbalances, and certain medical conditions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Hormones**\n    *   Hormones are chemical messengers produced by glands in the endocrine system.

    "content": "**Endometrial Ablation**\n\nEndometrial ablation is a surgical procedure that aims to minimize heavy or prolonged menstrual flow by disrupting the lining of the uterus, known as the endometrium.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe procedure involves destroying tissue in the uterine lining using various methods, including:\n\n* High frequency radio waves\n* Laser energy\n* Heated fluids\n* Balloon therapy\n* Freezing\n* Electrical current\n\nSome procedures use a thin, lighted tube called a hysteroscope to visualize the inside of the womb. General anesthesia is typically used to ensure the patient's comfort and safety.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nEndometrial ablation is often performed to treat heavy or irregular periods. Before undergoing this procedure, patients may have tried other treatments such as hormone medicines or an IUD.\n\nHowever, endometrial ablation is not suitable for women who wish to become pregnant in the future. Although it does not prevent pregnancy, it may reduce the chances of getting pregnant. Reliable contraception is essential for all women undergoing this procedure.\n\nIf a woman becomes pregnant after an ablation procedure, the pregnancy often miscarries or is at high risk due to scar tissue in the uterus.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThe risks associated with endometrial ablation vary depending on the method used. Some potential risks include:\n\n* Hole (perforation) in the wall of the womb\n* Scarring of the lining of the womb\n* Infection of the uterus\n* Damage to the cervix\n* Need for surgery to repair damage\n* Severe bleeding\n* Damage to the bowels\n\nAdditionally, there are risks associated with hysteroscopy, such as:\n\n* Absorption of excess fluid\n* Allergic reaction\n* Pain or cramping following the procedure\n* Burns or tissue damage from procedures using heat\n\n---\n\n**Endometrial Ablation**\n\n**Description**\n\nEndometrial ablation is a procedure used to treat abnormal bleeding by destroying tissue in the uterine lining. The tissue can be removed using:\n\n* High frequency radio waves\n* Laser energy\n* Heated fluids\n* Balloon therapy\n* Freezing\n* Electrical current\n\nSome types of procedures are done using a thin, lighted tube called a hysteroscope that sends images of the inside of the womb to a video monitor. Most of the time general anesthesia is used so you will be asleep and pain free.\n\nHowever, newer techniques can be done without using a hysteroscope. For these, a shot of numbing medicine is injected into the nerves around the cervix to block pain.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nThis procedure can treat heavy or irregular periods. Your provider will likely have tried other treatments first, such as hormone medicines or an IUD.\n\nEndometrial ablation will not be used if you may want to become pregnant in the future. Though this procedure does not prevent you from getting pregnant, it may reduce your chances of getting pregnant. Reliable contraception is important in all women who get the procedure.\n\nIf a woman gets pregnant after an ablation procedure, the pregnancy will often miscarry or be extremely high risk because of the scar tissue in the uterus.\n\n**Risks**\n\nAbsorption of excess fluid\nAllergic reaction\nPain or cramping following the procedure\nBurns or tissue damage from procedures using heat\n\nRisks of any pelvic surgery include:\n\n* Damage to nearby organs or tissues\n* Blood clots, which could travel to the lungs and be deadly (rare)\n\nRisks of anesthesia include:\n\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Dizziness\n* Headache\n* Breathing problems\n* Lung infection\n\nRisks of any surgery include:\n\n* Infection\n* Bleeding\n\n---\n\n**Endometrial Ablation**\n\nIf a woman gets pregnant after an ablation procedure, the pregnancy will often miscarry or be extremely high risk because of the scar tissue in the uterus.\n\n**Risks**\n\n*   **Hole (perforation) in the wall of the womb**\n*   **Scarring of the lining of the womb**\n*   **Infection of the uterus**\n*   **Damage to the cervix**\n*   **Need for surgery to repair damage**\n*   **Severe bleeding**\n*   **Damage to the bowels**\n\n**Risks of Ablation Procedures**\n\n*   **Absorption of excess fluid**\n*   **Allergic reaction**\n*   **Pain or cramping following the procedure**\n*   **Burns or tissue damage from procedures using heat**\n\n**Risks of Any Pelvic Surgery**\n\n*   **Damage to nearby organs or tissues**\n*   **Blood clots, which could travel to the lungs and be deadly (rare)**\n\n**Risks of Anesthesia**\n\n*   **Nausea and vomiting**\n*   **Dizziness**\n*   **Headache**\n*   **Breathing problems**\n*   **Lung infection**\n\n**Risks of Any Surgery**\n\n*   **Infection**\n*   **Bleeding**\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nA biopsy of the endometrium or lining of the uterus will be performed in the weeks prior to the procedure. Younger women may be treated with a hormone that blocks estrogen from being made by the body for 1 to 3 months before the procedure.\n\nYour provider may prescribe medicine to open your cervix. This makes it easier to insert the scope. You need to take this medicine about 8 to 12 hours before your procedure.\n\nBefore any surgery:\n\nAlways tell your provider about all the medicines you take. This includes vitamins, herbs, and supplements.\n\nTell your provider if you have diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, or other health problems.\n\nIf you smoke. If so, try to stop. Ask your provider for help. Smoking can slow wound healing.\n\nIn the 2 weeks before your procedure:\n\nYou may need to stop taking drugs that make it hard for your blood to clot. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), clopidogrel (Plavix), and warfarin (Coumadin). Your provider will tell you what you should or should not take.\n\nAsk your provider which medicines you can take on the day of your procedure.\n\nTell your provider if you have a cold, flu, fever, herpes outbreak, or other sickness.\n\nYou will be told when to arrive at the hospital. Ask if you need to arrange for someone to drive you home.\n\nOn the day of the procedure:\n\nYou may be asked not to drink or eat anything 6 to 12 hours before your procedure.\n\nTake any approved drugs with a small sip of water.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou may go home the same day. Rarely, you may need to stay overnight.\n\nYou may have menstrual-like cramps and light vaginal bleeding for 1 to 2 days. Ask your provider if you can take over-the-counter pain medicine for the cramping.\n\nYou may have a watery discharge for up to several weeks.\n\nYou can return to normal daily activities within 1 to 2 days. Do not have sex until your provider says it is OK.\n\nAny biopsy results are usually available within 1 to 2 weeks.\n\nYour provider will tell you the results of your procedure.\n\n---\n\n**Endometrial Ablation**\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe lining of your uterus heals by scarring. Women will most often have less menstrual bleeding after this procedure. Up to 30% to 50% of women will completely stop having periods. This result is more likely in older women. Women who continue to have heavy bleeding may need additional surgery.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Hysteroscopy - endometrial ablation\n* Laser thermal ablation\n* Endometrial ablation - radiofrequency\n* Endometrial ablation - thermal balloon ablation\n* Rollerball ablation\n* Hydrothermal ablation\n* Novasure ablation\n\n**References**\n\n* Baggish MS.

This stimulates the buildup of the lining of the uterus, which can lead to abnormal overgrowth and cancer.\n\n* Most cases occur between ages 60-70.\n* A few cases may occur before age 40.\n* Factors related to hormones increase risk:\n\t+ Estrogen replacement therapy without progesterone\n\t+ History of endometrial polyps\n\t+ Infrequent periods\n\t+ Never being pregnant\n\t+ Obesity\n\t+ Diabetes\n\t+ Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\n\t+ Starting menstruation at an early age (before 12)\n\t+ Starting menopause after age 50\n\t+ Tamoxifen, a drug used for breast cancer treatment\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Abnormal bleeding from the vagina, including bleeding between periods or spotting/bleeding after menopause\n* Extremely long, heavy, or frequent episodes of vaginal bleeding after age 40\n* Lower abdominal pain or pelvic cramping\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nDuring early stages, a pelvic exam may be normal. In advanced stages, there may be changes in the size, shape, or feel of the uterus or surrounding structures.\n\nTests that may be needed:\n\n* Endometrial biopsy: Taking tissue from the lining of the uterus for examination\n* Hysteroscopy: Inserting a thin telescope-like device to view the inside of the uterus and remove tissue for analysis\n* Ultrasound: Using sound waves to make a picture of the pelvic organs\n* Sonohysterography: Placing fluid in the uterus through a thin tube while making vaginal ultrasound images\n* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Creating images of internal organs\n\n**Stages of Endometrial Cancer**\n\n* Stage 1: Cancer is only in the uterus.\n* Stage 2: Cancer is in the uterus and cervix.\n* Stage 3: Cancer has spread outside of the uterus, but not beyond the true pelvis area.

    "content": "**Endometriosis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Endometriosis?**\n\nEndometriosis occurs when cells from the lining of your womb (uterus) grow in other areas of your body. This can cause pain, heavy vaginal bleeding, vaginal bleeding between periods, and problems getting pregnant (infertility).\n\n**Causes**\n\nEvery month, a woman's ovaries produce hormones that tell the cells lining the uterus to swell and get thicker. Your uterus sheds these cells along with blood and tissue through your vagina when you have your period.\n\nEndometriosis occurs when these cells grow outside the uterus in other parts of your body. This tissue may attach on your:\n\n* Ovaries\n* Fallopian tubes\n* Bowel\n* Rectum\n* Bladder\n* Lining of your pelvic area\n\nIt can grow in other areas of the body, too.\n\nThese growths stay in your body, and like the cells in the lining of your uterus, these growths react to the hormones from your ovaries. This may cause you to have pain during the month prior to the onset of your period. Over time, the growths may add more tissue and blood. Growths can also build up in the abdomen and pelvis, leading to chronic pelvic pain, heavy cycles, and infertility.\n\nThe cause of endometriosis is unknown. One idea is that when you get your period, the cells may travel backwards through the fallopian tubes into the pelvis. Once there, the cells attach and grow. However, this backward period flow occurs in many women. The immune system may play a role in causing endometriosis in women with the condition.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPain is the main symptom of endometriosis. You may have:\n\n* Painful periods -- Cramps or pain in your lower belly may begin a week or two before your period. Cramps may be steady and range from dull to severe.\n* Pain during or after sexual intercourse.\n* Pain with urination.\n* Pain with bowel movements.\n* Long-term pelvic or low back pain that may occur at any time and last for 6 months or more.\n\nOther symptoms of endometriosis include:\n\n* Heavy menstrual bleeding or bleeding between periods\n* Infertility (difficulty getting or staying pregnant)\n\nYou may not have any symptoms. Some women with a lot of tissue in their pelvis have no pain at all, while some women with milder disease have severe pain.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam, including a pelvic exam. You may have one of these tests to help diagnose the disease:\n\n* Transvaginal ultrasound\n* Pelvic laparoscopy\n* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nLearning how to manage your symptoms can make it easier to live with endometriosis.\n\nWhat type of treatment you have depends on:\n\n* Your age\n* Severity of your symptoms\n* Severity of the disease\n* Whether you want to get pregnant in the future\n\nThere is currently no cure for endometriosis. There are different treatment options.\n\n**Pain Relievers**\n\nIf you have mild symptoms, you may be able to manage cramping and pain with:\n\n* Exercise and relaxation techniques.\n* Over-the-counter pain relievers -- These include ibuprofen (Advil), naproxen (Aleve), and acetaminophen (Tylenol).\n* Prescription painkillers, if needed, for severe pain.\n* Regular exams every 6 to 12 months so your provider can assess the disease.\n\n**Hormone Therapy**\n\nThese medicines can stop endometriosis from getting worse. They may be given as pills, nasal spray, or shots. Only women who are not trying get pregnant should have this therapy. Some types of hormone therapy will also prevent you from getting pregnant while you are taking the medicine.\n\nBirth control pills -- With this therapy, you take the hormone pills (not the inactive or placebo pills) for 6 to 9 months continuously. Taking these pills relieves most symptoms. However, it does not treat any damage that has already occurred. But it may prevent ongoing damage for as long as the hormone-containing pills are taken. Many young patients will choose to continue this treatment indefinitely or until they wish to attempt pregnancy.\n\nProgesterone pills, injections, IUD -- This treatment helps shrink growths. Side effects may include weight gain and depression.\n\nGonadotropin-agonist medicines -- These medicines stop your ovaries from producing the hormone estrogen. This causes a menopause-like state. Side effects include hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and mood changes. Treatment is often limited to 6 months because it can weaken your bones. Your provider may give you small doses of hormone to relieve symptoms during this treatment. This is known as 'add-back' therapy. It may also help protect against bone loss, while not triggering growth of the endometriosis.\n\nGonadotropin-antagonist medicine -- This oral medication helps lower production of estrogen resulting in a menopausal-like state and controls the growth of endometrial tissue, resulting in less severe painful and heavy menses.\n\n**Surgery**\n\nYour provider may recommend surgery if you have severe pain that does not get better with other treatments.\n\nLaparoscopy helps diagnose the disease and can also remove growths and scar tissue. Because only a small cut is made in your belly, you will heal faster than other types of surgery.\nLaparotomy involves making a large incision (cut) in your belly to remove growths and scar tissue. This is major surgery, so healing takes longer.\nLaparoscopy or laparotomy may be a good option if you want to become pregnant, because they treat the disease and leave your organs in place.\nHysterectomy is surgery to remove your uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. Having both your ovaries removed means entering menopause. You would only have this surgery if you have severe symptoms which did not get better with other treatments and do not want to become pregnant in the future.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThere is no cure for endometriosis. Hormone therapy can help relieve symptoms, but symptoms often return when therapy is stopped. Surgical treatment may help relieve symptoms for years. However, not all women with endometriosis are helped by these treatments.\n\nOnce you enter menopause, endometriosis is unlikely to cause problems.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nEndometriosis can lead to problems getting pregnant. However, most women with mild symptoms can still get pregnant. Laparoscopy to remove growths and scar tissue may help improve your chances of becoming pregnant. If it does not, you may want to consider fertility treatments.\n\nOther complications of endometriosis include:\n\n* Long-term pelvic pain that interferes with social and work activities\n* Large cysts in the ovaries and pelvis that may break open (rupture)\n\nIn rare cases, endometriosis tissue may block the intestines or urinary tract.\n\nVery rarely, cancer may develop in the areas of tissue growth after menopause.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* You have symptoms of endometriosis\n* Feel dizzy or lightheaded due to heavy menstrual blood loss\n* Back pain or other symptoms reoccurring after endometriosis is treated\n\nYou may want to get screened for endometriosis if:\n\n* Your mother or sister has the disease\n* You are unable to become pregnant after trying for 1 year\n\n---\n\n**Endometriosis**\n\n\\n\\n**What is Endometriosis?**\n\nEndometriosis occurs when cells from the lining of your womb (uterus) grow in other areas of your body. This can cause pain, heavy vaginal bleeding, vaginal bleeding between periods, and problems getting pregnant (infertility).\n\n\\n\\n**Causes**\n\nEvery month, a woman's ovaries produce hormones that tell the cells lining the uterus to swell and get thicker. Your uterus sheds these cells along with blood and tissue through your vagina when you have your period.\n\nEndometriosis occurs when these cells grow outside the uterus in other parts of your body. This tissue may attach on your:\n\n* Ovaries\n* Fallopian tubes\n* Bowel\n* Rectum\n* Bladder\n* Lining of your pelvic area\n\nIt can grow in other areas of the body, too.\n\nThese growths stay in your body, and like the cells in the lining of your uterus, these growths react to the hormones from your ovaries. This may cause you to have pain during the month prior to the onset of your period. Over time, the growths may add more tissue and blood. Growths can also build up in the abdomen and pelvis, leading to chronic pelvic pain, heavy cycles, and infertility.\n\nThe cause of endometriosis is unknown. One idea is that when you get your period, the cells may travel backwards through the fallopian tubes into the pelvis. Once there, the cells attach and grow. However, this backward period flow occurs in many women. The immune system may play a role in causing endometriosis in women with the condition.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nPain is the main symptom of endometriosis. You may have:\n\n* Painful periods -- Cramps or pain in your lower belly may begin a week or two before your period. Cramps may be steady and range from dull to severe.\n* Pain during or after sexual intercourse.\n* Pain with urination.\n* Pain with bowel movements.\n* Long-term pelvic or low back pain that may occur at any time and last for 6 months or more.\n\nOther symptoms of endometriosis include:\n\n* Heavy menstrual bleeding or bleeding between periods\n* Infertility (difficulty getting or staying pregnant)\n\nYou may not have any symptoms. Some women with a lot of tissue in their pelvis have no pain at all, while some women with milder disease have severe pain.\n\n\\n\\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam, including a pelvic exam. You may have one of these tests to help diagnose the disease:\n\n* Transvaginal ultrasound\n* Pelvic laparoscopy\n* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment**\n\nLearning how to manage your symptoms can make it easier to live with endometriosis.\n\nWhat type of treatment you have depends on:\n\n* Your age\n* Severity of your symptoms\n* Severity of the disease\n* Whether you want to get pregnant in the future\n\nThere is currently no cure for endometriosis. There are different treatment options.\n\n**Pain Relievers**\n\nIf you have mild symptoms, you may be able to manage cramping and pain with:\n\n* Exercise and relaxation techniques.\n* Over-the-counter pain relievers -- These include ibuprofen (Advil), naproxen (Aleve), and acetaminophen (Tylenol).\n* Prescription painkillers, if needed, for severe pain.\n* Regular exams every 6 to 12 months so your provider can assess the disease.\n\n**Hormone Therapy**\n\nThese medicines can stop endometriosis from getting worse. They may be given as pills, nasal spray, or shots. Only women who are not trying get pregnant should have this therapy. Some types of hormone therapy will also prevent you from getting pregnant while you are taking the medicine.\n\nBirth control pills -- With this therapy, you take the hormone pills (not the inactive or placebo pills) for 6 to 9 months continuously. Taking these pills relieves most symptoms. However, it does not treat any damage that has already occurred. But it may prevent ongoing damage for as long as the hormone-containing pills are taken.\n\nProgesterone pills, injections, IUD -- This treatment helps shrink growths.

It occurs in about 10% of women of reproductive age. Sometimes, it may run in families. Endometriosis probably starts when a woman begins having periods. However, it usually is not diagnosed until ages 25 to 35.\n\nYou are more likely to develop endometriosis if you:\n\n* Have a mother or sister with endometriosis\n* Started your period at a young age\n* Never had children\n* Have frequent periods, or they last 7 or more days\n\n---\n\n**Endometriosis**\n\nYou are more likely to develop endometriosis if you:\n\n* Have your first period at a young age\n* Have never been pregnant\n* Have had children who were premature or low birth weight\n* Have family members with endometriosis\n* Have certain medical conditions, such as infertility or pelvic inflammatory disease\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPain is the main symptom of endometriosis.

It is more likely to occur after miscarriage or childbirth. It is also more common after a long labor or C-section.\n\nThe risk for endometritis is higher after having a pelvic procedure that is done through the cervix. Such procedures include:\n\n*   D and C (dilation and curettage)\n*   Endometrial biopsy\n*   Hysteroscopy\n*   Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD)\n*   Childbirth (more common after C-section than vaginal birth)\n\nEndometritis can occur at the same time as other pelvic infections.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\n*   Swelling of the abdomen\n*   Abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge\n*   Discomfort with bowel movement (including constipation)\n*   Fever\n*   General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling\n*   Pain in lower abdomen or pelvic region (uterine pain)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam with a pelvic exam.

In some cases, patients may experience fever, chills, or vision loss. A diagnosis of endophthalmitis can be made through a combination of clinical presentation, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.\n\n**Treatment and Prognosis**\n\nThe treatment of endophthalmitis typically involves intravitreal antibiotics, vitrectomy surgery, and systemic antibiotics. In some cases, patients may require hospitalization for close monitoring and management of their condition. The prognosis for patients with endophthalmitis varies depending on the severity of the infection and the timeliness of treatment.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nIntracameral antibiotic prophylaxis has been shown to reduce the risk of acute endophthalmitis after cataract surgery. Surgeons should consider using this preventive measure to minimize the risk of endophthalmitis in their patients.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   Eye Infections",

    "content": "**Endoscopic Thoracic Sympathectomy**\n\n**Description**\n\nYou will receive general anesthesia before surgery. This will make you asleep and pain-free.\n\nThe surgery is usually done the following way:\n\n*   The surgeon makes 2 or 3 small cuts (incisions) under one arm on the side where the excessive sweating occurs.\n*   Your lung on this side is deflated (collapsed) so that air does not move in and out of it during surgery. This gives the surgeon more room to work.\n*   A small camera called an endoscope is inserted through one of the cuts into your chest. Video from the camera shows on a monitor in the operating room. The surgeon views the monitor while doing the surgery.\n*   Other small tools are inserted through the other cuts.\n*   Using these tools, the surgeon finds the nerves that control sweating in the problem area. These are cut, clipped, or destroyed.\n*   Your lung on this side is inflated.\n*   The cuts are closed with stitches (sutures).\n*   A small drainage tube may be left in your chest for a day or so.\n\nAfter doing this procedure on one side of your body, the surgeon may do the same on the other side. The surgery takes about 1 to 3 hours.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nThis surgery is usually done in people whose palms sweat much more heavily than normal. It may also be used to treat extreme sweating of the face. It is only used when other treatments to reduce sweating have not worked.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n*   Allergic reactions to medicines\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Bleeding, blood clots, or infection\n\nRisks for this procedure are:\n\n*   Blood collection in the chest (hemothorax)\n*   Air collection in the chest (pneumothorax)\n*   Damage to arteries or nerves\n*   Horner syndrome (decreased facial sweating and drooping of one or both eyelids)\n*   Increased or new sweating\n*   Increased sweating in other areas of the body (compensatory sweating)\n*   Slowing of the heartbeat\n*   Pneumonia\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nTell your surgeon or health care provider:\n\n*   If you are or could be pregnant\n*   What medicines, vitamins, herbs, and other supplements you are taking, even ones you bought without a prescription\n\n---\n\n**Endoscopic Thoracic Sympathectomy**\n\n\\n\\n**What to Expect Before Surgery**\n\nIf you are or could be pregnant, inform your healthcare provider. Also, let them know what medicines, vitamins, herbs, and other supplements you are taking, even ones you bought without a prescription.\n\nDuring the days before surgery:\n\n*   You may be asked to stop taking blood thinner drugs like aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and warfarin (Coumadin). Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\n*   If you smoke, try to quit. Smoking increases the risk for problems such as slow healing.\n\n\\n\\n**On the Day of Your Surgery**\n\nFollow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking. Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water. Arrive at the hospital on time.\n\n\\n\\n**After the Procedure**\n\nMost people stay in the hospital one night and go home the next day. You may have pain for a week or two. Take pain medicine as your doctor recommended. You may need acetaminophen (Tylenol) or prescription pain medicine. Do not drive if you are taking narcotic pain medicine.\n\nFollow the surgeon's instructions about taking care of the incisions, including:\n\n*   Keep the incision areas clean, dry, and covered with dressings (bandages). If your incision is covered with skin adhesive such as Dermabond (liquid bandage) you may not need any dressings.\n*   Wash the areas and change the dressings as instructed.\n*   Ask your surgeon when you can shower or bathe.\n\nSlowly resume your regular activities as you are able. Keep follow-up visits with the surgeon. At these visits, the surgeon will check the incisions and see if the surgery was successful.\n\n\\n\\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThis surgery may improve the quality of life for most people. It does not work as well for people who have very heavy armpit sweating. Some people notice sweating in new places on the body, but this may go away on its own.\n\n---\n\n**Endoscopic Thoracic Sympathectomy**\n\n**What to Expect (During the Procedure)**\n\n*   Relief from excessive sweating\n*   Slowing of the heartbeat\n*   Pneumonia\n\n**Risks of Anesthesia and Surgery**\n\n*   Risks for this procedure are:\n    *   Infection\n    *   Bleeding\n    *   Damage to surrounding tissue\n    *   Nerve damage\n    *   Scarring or keloid formation\n    *   Reaction to anesthesia\n    *   Pneumonia\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\n*   Tell your surgeon or health care provider:\n    *   If you are or could be pregnant\n    *   What medicines, vitamins, herbs, and other supplements you are taking, even ones you bought without a prescription\n*   During the days before the surgery:\n    *   You may be asked to stop taking blood thinner drugs.

    "content": "**Endoscopic Ultrasound**\n\nEndoscopic ultrasound is a type of imaging test used to see organs in and near the digestive tract.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nUltrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of the inside of the body. Endoscopic ultrasound does this with a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope. The tube is passed through the mouth or rectum and into the digestive tract. Sound waves are sent out the end of the tube and bounce off the organs in the body. A computer receives these waves and creates a picture of what's inside.\n\n*   This test does not expose you to harmful radiation.\n*   If a sample or biopsy is needed, a thin needle can be passed through the tube to collect fluid or tissue without hurting.\n*   Treatment of certain problems can also be done during the test.\n\nThe test takes 30 to 90 minutes to complete. You may be given medicine to help you relax during the procedure.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYour health care provider will tell you what to do before the test. You'll need to:\n\n*   Stop drinking and eating as instructed by your provider.\n*   Give your provider a list of all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medications, herbs, and supplements. Some medications may need to be stopped a week before the test.\n\nSince you won't be able to drive or return to work on the day of the test, you'll need someone to take you home.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nBefore the test, you'll receive medicine through an IV to help you relax (a sedative). You may fall asleep or not remember the test. Some people feel the test is slightly uncomfortable.\n\nAfter the test, you may feel sleepy and unable to drink or walk for the first hour. You may have a sore throat due to the tube being inserted. Air or carbon dioxide gas may have been put in your digestive tract during the test, which can make you feel bloated but will go away once the gas is released.\n\nWhen you're fully awake, you can be taken home and rest that day. You may have fluids and light meals.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nYou may have this test to:\n\n*   Find the cause of abdominal pain\n*   Find the cause of weight loss\n*   Diagnose diseases of the pancreas, bile duct, and gallbladder\n*   Guide a biopsy of tumors, lymph nodes, and other tissue\n*   Look at cysts, tumors, and cancers\n*   Look for stones in the bile duct\n*   Deliver medicine to a part of the body\n*   Drain fluid from a part of the body\n\nThis test can also stage cancers of the:\n\n*   Esophagus\n*   Lung\n*   Pancreas\n*   Rectum\n*   Stomach\n\n---\n\n**Endoscopic Ultrasound**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nEndoscopic ultrasound is a type of imaging test used to see organs in and near the digestive tract.\n\n**How is it performed?**\n\n*   A thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is passed through the mouth or rectum into the digestive tract.\n*   Sound waves are sent out the end of the tube and bounce off the organs in the body.\n*   A computer receives these waves and uses them to create a picture of what is inside.\n\n**Preparation**\n\nBefore the test, you will be told when to stop drinking and eating.

The scope is passed through the opening of the urethra.\n* Laparoscopy is used to look directly at the ovaries, appendix, or other abdominal organs. The scope is inserted through small surgical cuts in the pelvic or belly area. Tumors or organs in the abdomen or pelvis can be removed.\n* Arthroscopy is used to look directly in the joints, such as the knee. The scope is inserted through small surgical cuts around the joint. Problems with bones, tendons, ligaments can be treated.\n\n**Risks**\n\nEach endoscopy test has its own risks.

    "content": "**Endotracheal Intubation**\n\nEndotracheal intubation is a medical procedure in which a tube is placed into the windpipe (trachea) through the mouth or nose. In most emergency situations, it is placed through the mouth.\n\n**Description**\n\nWhether you are awake (conscious) or not awake (unconscious), you will be given medicine to make it easier and more comfortable to insert the tube. You may also receive medicine to relax.\n\nThe health care provider will insert a device called a laryngoscope to be able to view the vocal cords and the upper part of the windpipe.\n\nIf the procedure is being done to help with breathing, a tube is then inserted into the windpipe and past the vocal cords to just above the spot where the trachea branches into the lungs. The tube can then be connected to a mechanical ventilator to assist breathing.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nEndotracheal intubation is done to:\n\n* Keep the airway open in order to give oxygen, medicine, or anesthesia.\n* Support breathing in certain illnesses, such as pneumonia, emphysema, heart failure, collapsed lung or severe trauma.\n* Remove blockages from the airway.\n* Allow the provider to get a better view of the upper airway.\n* Protect the lungs in people who are unable to protect their airway and are at risk for breathing in fluid (aspiration). This includes people with certain types of strokes, overdoses, or massive bleeding from the esophagus or stomach.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks include:\n\n* Bleeding\n* Infection\n* Trauma to the voice box (larynx), thyroid gland, vocal cords and windpipe (trachea), or esophagus\n* Puncture or tearing (perforation) of body parts in the chest cavity, leading to lung collapse\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nThe procedure is most often done in emergency situations, so there are no steps you can take to prepare.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou will be in the hospital to monitor your breathing and your blood oxygen levels. You may be given oxygen or placed on a breathing machine. If you are awake, your provider may give you medicine to reduce your anxiety or discomfort.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outlook will depend on the reason the procedure needed to be done.\n\n---\n\n**Endotracheal Intubation**\n\n**What is Endotracheal Intubation?**\n\nEndotracheal intubation is a medical procedure used to insert a tube into the windpipe (trachea) to help with breathing. The tube is connected to a mechanical ventilator or oxygen tank to provide necessary oxygen and support breathing.\n\n**Why is Endotracheal Intubation Performed?**\n\nEndotracheal intubation is performed in the following situations:\n\n*   To keep the airway open for administering oxygen, medicine, or anesthesia.\n*   To support breathing in patients with certain illnesses such as pneumonia, emphysema, heart failure, collapsed lung, or severe trauma.\n*   To remove blockages from the airway.\n*   To allow the healthcare provider to get a better view of the upper airway.\n*   To protect the lungs in people who are unable to protect their airway and are at risk for breathing in fluid (aspiration).

    "content": "**Endovascular Embolization**\n\nEndovascular embolization is a medical procedure used to treat abnormal blood vessels in the brain and other parts of the body. It serves as an alternative to open surgery.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe procedure typically involves general anesthesia, where you are asleep and pain-free, accompanied by a breathing tube. Alternatively, you may be given medication to relax you without falling asleep.\n\nA small surgical cut is made in the groin area or wrist. The doctor uses a needle to create a hole in the femoral artery, a large blood vessel in the groin. This procedure can also be performed through the radial artery in the wrist.\n\nA thin, flexible tube called a catheter is passed through the open skin and into the artery. Dye is injected through this tube to allow the blood vessel to be seen on x-ray images. The doctor then gently moves the catheter through the blood vessel up to the area being treated.\n\nOnce the catheter is in place, the doctor places small plastic particles, glue, metal coils, foam, or a balloon through it to seal off the faulty blood vessel. If metal coils are used, it is referred to as coil embolization.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nThe procedure is most often used to treat aneurysms in the brain. It can also be employed for other medical conditions when open surgery might be risky. The goal of the treatment is to prevent bleeding in the problem area and reduce the risk that the blood vessel feeding it will break open (rupture).\n\nYour doctor will help you decide whether it is safer to have surgery to block off the aneurysm before it can rupture.\n\n**This Procedure May Be Used To Treat:**\n\n* Arteriovenous malformation (AVM)\n* Brain aneurysm\n* Carotid artery cavernous fistula (a problem with the large artery in the neck)\n* Certain tumors\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks from the procedure may include:\n\n* Bleeding at the site of the needle puncture\n* Bleeding in the brain\n* Damage to the artery where the needle is inserted\n* Dislodged coil or balloon\n* Failure to completely treat the abnormal blood vessel\n* Infection\n* Stroke\n* Symptoms that keep returning\n* Death\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nThis procedure is often done on an emergency basis. If it is not an emergency:\n\n* Tell your health care provider what drugs or herbs you are taking, and if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol.\n* Ask your provider which medicines you should still take on the day of the surgery.\n* Try to stop smoking.\n* You will most often be asked not to eat or drink anything for 8 hours before the surgery.\n* Take the medicines you have been told to take with a small sip of water.\n* Arrive at the hospital on time.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nIf there was no bleeding before the procedure, you may need to stay in the hospital for 1 to 2 days. If bleeding occurred, your hospital stay will be longer.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow fast you recover depends on your overall health, the severity of your medical condition, and other factors. In most cases, endovascular embolization is a successful procedure with good outcomes. The outlook also depends on any brain damage that occurred from bleeding before, during, or after the surgery.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nTreatment - endovascular embolism; Coil embolization; Cerebral aneurysm - endovascular; Coiling - endovascular; Saccular aneurysm - endovascular; Berry aneurysm - endovascular repair; Fusiform aneurysm repair - endovascular; Aneurysm repair - endovascular\n\n---\n\n**Endovascular Embolization**\n\n**What is Endovascular Embolization?**\n\nEndovascular embolization is a medical procedure used to treat abnormal blood vessels in the brain and other parts of the body.

It's also called benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH for short. Benign means not cancer. And hyperplasia means too much cell growth. BPH isn't cancer and it doesn't increase your risk of getting prostate cancer.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What causes an enlarged prostate (BPH)?**\n\nResearchers aren't sure why the prostate keeps growing. Some researchers think changes in hormones with aging may cause the prostate to get bigger.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Who is more likely to develop BPH?**\n\nYou're more likely to develop BPH if you:\n\n* Are age 40 or older. The chance of getting BPH increases as you get older.\n* Have family members who have had BPH.\n* Have certain health conditions such as:\n\t+ Obesity.\n\t+ Heart disease and problems with blood circulation.\n\t+ Type 2 diabetes.\n\t+ Erectile dysfunction.\n* Don't get enough physical activity.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the symptoms of BPH?**\n\nSymptoms of BPH include:\n\n* Having a frequent or urgent need to urinate\n* Waking up many times to urinate\n* Having problems with urine flow, such as:\n\t+ Trouble starting to urinate\n\t+ A stream that's weak, slow, or stops and starts\n\t+ Dribbling after urination\n\t+ Urinary incontinence\n\t+ Feeling that you can't completely empty your bladder\n\t+ Pain after ejaculation or during urination\n\t+ Urine with an unusual color or smell\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What other problems can BPH cause?**\n\nFor most people, BPH doesn't cause other problems.

This a medical emergency.\n* Urinary tract infections (UTIs)\n* Bladder damage and bladder stones\n* Kidney damage\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is BPH diagnosed?**\n\nTo find out if you have BPH, your provider will:\n\n* Ask about your medical history. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take, because certain medicines can make BPH symptoms worse.\n* Ask about your family health history.\n* Examine you. The exam may include a digital rectal exam (DRE) of your prostate. In a DRE, your provider inserts a gloved finger into your rectum to check if your prostate is large, tender, or irregular in any other way.\n* Order medical tests, if needed, such as:\n\t+ Urine tests.\n\t+ A PSA blood test (prostate-specific antigen test).\n\t+ Urodynamic testing to see how well you can hold and release urine.\n\t+ Cystoscopy to look inside your urethra and bladder.\n\t+ Ultrasound pictures of your prostate and urinary tract.\n\t+ A prostate biopsy to diagnose or rule out prostate cancer.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the treatments for BPH?**\n\nNot everyone needs treatment for BPH.

They include:\n\t+ Drinking less before bedtime or going out\n\t+ Avoiding or cutting back on beverages with caffeine and alcohol\n\t+ Bladder training and exercising the muscles that control urine flow\n\t+ Preventing or treating constipation\n* Medicines can help mild to moderate symptoms by:\n\t+ Stopping the prostate from growing\n\t+ Shrinking the prostate\n\t+ Relaxing muscles to improve urine flow\n* Medical procedures can help improve moderate to severe BPH symptoms when medicines don't help enough. There are several different types of procedures.

    "content": "**Enlarged Prostate - After Care**\n\nYour health care provider has told you that you have an enlarged prostate gland. Here are some things to know about your condition.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nThe prostate is a gland that produces the fluid that carries sperm during ejaculation. It surrounds the tube through which urine passes out of the body (the urethra).\n\nAn enlarged prostate means the gland has grown bigger. As the gland grows, it can block the urethra and cause problems, such as:\n\n* Not being able to fully empty your bladder\n* Needing to urinate two or more times per night\n* Slowed or delayed start of the urinary stream and dribbling at the end\n* Straining to urinate and a weak urine stream\n* Strong and sudden urge to urinate or a loss of urinary control\n\n**Lifestyle Changes**\n\nThe following changes may help you control symptoms:\n\n* Urinate when you first get the urge. Also, go to the bathroom on a timed schedule, even if you do not feel a need to urinate.\n* Avoid alcohol and caffeine, especially after dinner.\n* Do not drink a lot of fluid all at once. Spread out fluids over the day. Avoid drinking fluids within 2 hours of bedtime.\n* Keep warm and exercise regularly. Cold weather and lack of physical activity may worsen symptoms.\n* Reduce stress. Nervousness and tension can lead to more frequent urination.\n\n**Medicines, Herbs, and Supplements**\n\nYour provider may have you take a medicine called alpha-1- blocker. Most people find that these medicines help their symptoms. Symptoms often get better 3 to 7 days after starting on the medicine. You must take this medicine every day. There are several medicines in this category, including terazosin (Hytrin), doxazosin (Cardura), tamsulosin (Flomax), alfuzosin (Uroxatrol), and silodosin (Rapaflo).\n\nCommon side effects include nasal stuffiness, headaches, lightheadedness when you stand up, and weakness. You may also notice less semen when you ejaculate. This is not a medical problem but some men don't like how it feels.\n\nOther medicines such as finasteride or dutasteride may also be prescribed. These medicines help shrink the prostate over time and help with symptoms.\n\nYou will need to take these medicines every day for 3 to 6 months before your symptoms begin to improve.\n\nSide effects include less interest in sex and less semen when you ejaculate.\n\nWatch out for medicines that may make your symptoms worse:\n\n* Try not to take over-the-counter cold and sinus medicines that contain decongestants or antihistamines. They can make your symptoms worse.\n* Men who are taking water pills or diuretics may want to talk to their provider about reducing the dosage or switching to another type of medicine.\n* Other medicines that may worsen symptoms are certain antidepressants and medicines used to treat spasticity.\n\nMany herbs and supplements have been tried for treating an enlarged prostate.\n\nSaw palmetto has been used by many men to ease BPH symptoms. It is unclear whether this herb is effective in relieving the signs and symptoms of BPH.\n\nTalk with your provider about any herbs or supplements you are taking.\n\nOften, makers of herbal remedies and dietary supplements do not need approval from the FDA to sell their products, and thus, their studies may be less rigorous.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider right away if you have:\n\n* Less urine than usual\n* Fever or chills\n* Back, side, or abdominal pain\n* Blood or pus in your urine\n\nAlso contact if:\n\n* Your bladder does not feel completely empty after you urinate.\n* You take medicines that may cause urinary problems. These may include diuretics, antihistamines, antidepressants, or sedatives. Do not stop or change your medicines without first talking to your provider.\n* You have taken self-care steps and your symptoms have not gotten better.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nBPH - self-care; Benign prostatic hypertrophy - self-care; Benign prostatic hyperplasia - self-care\n\n**References**\n\nAndersson KE, Wein AJ.

As the gland grows, it can block the urethra and cause problems, such as:\n\n* Not being able to fully empty your bladder\n* Needing to urinate two or more times per night\n* Slowed or delayed start of the urinary stream and dribbling at the end\n* Straining to urinate and a weak urine stream\n* Strong and sudden urge to urinate or a loss of urinary control\n\n**Lifestyle Changes**\n\nThe following changes may help you control symptoms:\n\n* Urinate when you first get the urge. Also, go to the bathroom on a timed schedule, even if you do not feel a need to urinate.\n* Avoid alcohol and caffeine, especially after dinner.\n* Do not drink a lot of fluid all at once. Spread out fluids over the day. Avoid drinking fluids within 2 hours of bedtime.\n* Keep warm and exercise regularly. Cold weather and lack of physical activity may worsen symptoms.\n* Reduce stress. Nervousness and tension can lead to more frequent urination.\n\n**Medicines, Herbs, and Supplements**\n\nYour provider may have you take a medicine called alpha-1-blocker. Most people find that these medicines help their symptoms. Symptoms often get better 3 to 7 days after starting on the medicine. You must take this medicine every day. There are several medicines in this category, including terazosin (Hytrin), doxazosin (Cardura), tamsulosin (Flomax), alfuzosin (Uroxatrol), and silodosin (Rapaflo).\n\nCommon side effects include nasal stuffiness, headaches, lightheadedness when you stand up, and weakness. You may also notice less semen when you ejaculate.\n\n**Watch Out for Medicines That May Make Your Symptoms Worse**\n\nTry not to take over-the-counter cold and sinus medicines that contain decongestants or antihistamines. They can make your symptoms worse.\n\nMen who are taking water pills or diuretics may want to talk to their provider about reducing the dosage or switching to another type of medicine.\n\nOther medicines that may worsen symptoms are certain antidepressants and medicines used to treat spasticity.\n\n**Many Herbs and Supplements Have Been Tried for Treating an Enlarged Prostate**\n\nSaw palmetto has been used by many men to ease BPH symptoms. It is unclear whether this herb is effective in relieving the signs and symptoms of BPH.\n\nTalk with your provider about any herbs or supplements you are taking.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider right away if you have:\n\n* Less urine than usual\n* Fever or chills\n* Back, side, or abdominal pain\n* Blood or pus in your urine\n\nAlso contact if:\n\n* Your bladder does not feel completely empty after you urinate.\n* You take medicines that may cause urinary problems. These may include diuretics, antihistamines, antidepressants, or sedatives. Do not stop or change your medicines without first talking to your provider.\n* You have taken self-care steps and your symptoms have not gotten better.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nBPH - self-care; Benign prostatic hypertrophy - self-care; Benign prostatic hyperplasia - self-care\n\n---\n\n**Enlarged Prostate - After Care**\n\n**Medicines for Enlarged Prostate**\n\n*   Take your medicine every day as prescribed by your provider.\n*   There are several medicines in this category, including terazosin (Hytrin), doxazosin (Cardura), tamsulosin (Flomax), alfuzosin (Uroxatrol), and silodosin (Rapaflo).\n*   Common side effects include nasal stuffiness, headaches, lightheadedness when you stand up, and weakness.\n*   You may also notice less semen when you ejaculate. This is not a medical problem but some men don't like how it feels.\n\n**Interactions with Other Medicines**\n\n*   Ask your provider before taking sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), and tadalafil (Cialis) with alpha-1- blockers because there can often be an interaction.\n*   Other medicines such as finasteride or dutasteride may also be prescribed. These medicines help shrink the prostate over time and help with symptoms.\n\n**Side Effects of Medicines**\n\n*   You will need to take these medicines every day for 3 to 6 months before your symptoms begin to improve.\n*   Side effects include less interest in sex and less semen when you ejaculate.\n\n**Medicines That May Make Your Symptoms Worse**\n\n*   Try not to take over-the-counter cold and sinus medicines that contain decongestants or antihistamines. They can make your symptoms worse.\n*   Men who are taking water pills or diuretics may want to talk to their provider about reducing the dosage or switching to another type of medicine.\n*   Other medicines that may worsen symptoms are certain antidepressants and medicines used to treat spasticity.\n\n**Herbs and Supplements**\n\n*   Many herbs and supplements have been tried for treating an enlarged prostate.\n*   Saw palmetto has been used by many men to ease BPH symptoms. It is unclear whether this herb is effective in relieving the signs and symptoms of BPH.\n*   Talk with your provider about any herbs or supplements you are taking.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\n*   Contact your provider right away if you have:\n    *   Less urine than usual\n    *   Fever or chills\n    *   Back, side, or abdominal pain\n    *   Blood or pus in your urine\n*   Also contact if:\n    *   Your bladder does not feel completely empty after you urinate.\n    *   You take medicines that may cause urinary problems. These may include diuretics, antihistamines, antidepressants, or sedatives. Do not stop or change your medicines without first talking to your provider.\n    *   You have taken self-care steps and your symptoms have not gotten better.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n*   BPH - self-care; Benign prostatic hypertrophy - self-care; Benign prostatic hyperplasia - self-care\n\n---\n\n**After Care for Enlarged Prostate**\n\n\\n\\nIf you have an enlarged prostate, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), your doctor may recommend certain lifestyle changes and medications to help manage your symptoms.\n\n**Lifestyle Changes**\n\n*   Avoid foods that can irritate the bladder, such as caffeine, spicy foods, and citrus fruits.\n*   Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water.\n*   Exercise regularly to improve urine flow and reduce symptoms.\n*   Quit smoking, as it can worsen BPH symptoms.\n\n**Medications**\n\n*   Alpha blockers: relax the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, making it easier to urinate.\n*   5-alpha reductase inhibitors: shrink the size of the enlarged prostate over time.\n*   Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors: improve urine flow by relaxing the smooth muscle in the prostate.\n\n**When to See a Doctor**\n\n*   If you experience severe urinary retention, frequent urination, or difficulty starting to urinate.\n*   If you have a fever above 101.5°F (38.6°C) along with symptoms of BPH.\n*   If you notice blood in your urine or semen.\n\n**Self-Care**\n\n*   Practice good hygiene to prevent infections.\n*   Avoid holding your urine for extended periods, as this can lead to urinary tract infections.\n*   Consider keeping a bladder diary to track your urination patterns and identify potential issues.",

    "content": "**Enlarged Prostate**\n\nThe prostate is a gland that produces some of the fluid that carries sperm during ejaculation. The prostate gland surrounds the urethra, the tube through which urine passes out of the body.\n\nAn enlarged prostate means the gland has grown bigger. Prostate enlargement happens to almost all men as they get older.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe actual cause of prostate enlargement is unknown. Factors linked to aging and changes in the cells of the testicles may have a role in the growth of the gland, as well as testosterone levels. Men who have had their testicles removed at a young age (for example, as a result of testicular cancer) do not develop BPH.\n\nAlso, if the testicles are removed after a man develops BPH, the prostate begins to shrink in size. However, this is not a standard treatment for an enlarged prostate.\n\nSome facts about prostate enlargement:\n\n* The likelihood of developing an enlarged prostate increases with age.\n* BPH is so common that it has been said all men will have an enlarged prostate if they live long enough.\n* A small amount of prostate enlargement is present in many men over age 40. More than 90% of men over age 80 have the condition.\n* No risk factors have been identified, other than having normally-functioning testicles.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nLess than half of all men with BPH have symptoms of the disease. Symptoms may include:\n\n* Dribbling at the end of urinating\n* Inability to urinate (urinary retention)\n* Incomplete emptying of your bladder\n* Incontinence\n* Needing to urinate 2 or more times per night\n* Pain with urination or bloody urine (these may indicate infection)\n* Slowed or delayed start of the urinary stream\n* Straining to urinate\n* Strong and sudden urge to urinate\n* Weak urine stream\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will ask questions about your medical history. A digital rectal exam will also be done to feel the prostate gland. Other tests may include:\n\n* Urine flow rate\n* Post-void residual urine test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate\n* Pressure-flow studies to measure the pressure in the bladder as you urinate\n* Urinalysis to check for blood or infection\n* Urine culture to check for infection\n* Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test to screen for prostate cancer\n* Cystoscopy\n* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine tests to check for reduced kidney function\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment you choose will be based on how bad your symptoms are and how much they bother you. Your provider will also take into account other medical problems you may have.\n\nTreatment options include \"watchful waiting,\" lifestyle changes, medicines, or surgery.\n\nIf you are over 60, you are more likely to have symptoms. But many men with an enlarged prostate have only minor symptoms. Self-care steps are often enough to make you feel better.\n\nIf you have BPH, you should have a yearly assessment to monitor your symptoms and see if you need changes in treatment.\n\n**SELF-CARE**\n\nFor mild symptoms:\n\n* Urinate when you first get the urge. Also, go to the bathroom on a timed schedule, even if you don't feel a need to urinate.\n* Avoid alcohol and caffeine, especially after dinner.\n* Do not drink a lot of fluid all at once. Spread out fluids during the day. Avoid drinking fluids within 2 hours of bedtime.\n* Try not to take over-the-counter cold and sinus medicines that contain decongestants or antihistamines. These medicines can increase BPH symptoms.\n* Keep warm and exercise regularly. Cold weather and lack of physical activity may worsen symptoms.\n* Reduce stress. Nervousness and tension can lead to more frequent urination.\n\n**MEDICINES**\n\nAlpha-1 blockers are a class of medicines, some of which have been used to treat high blood pressure. These medicines relax the muscles of the bladder neck and prostate. This allows easier urination. Most people who take alpha-1 blockers notice improvement in their symptoms, usually within 3 to 7 days after starting the medicine.\n\nFinasteride and dutasteride lower levels of hormones produced by the prostate. These medicines also reduce the size of the gland, increase urine flow rate, and decrease symptoms of BPH. You may need to take these medicines for 3 to 6 months before you notice symptoms getting better. Possible side effects include decreased sex drive and impotence.\n\nAntibiotics may be prescribed to treat chronic prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate), which may occur with BPH. BPH symptoms may improve in some men after a course of antibiotics.\n\nWatch out for medicines that may make your symptoms worse:\n\n**SAW PALMETTO**\n\nMany herbs have been tried for treating an enlarged prostate. Many men use saw palmetto to ease symptoms. Some studies have shown that it may help with symptoms, but results are mixed, and more research is needed. If you use saw palmetto and think it works, ask your provider if you should still take it.\n\n**SURGERY**\n\nProstate surgery may be recommended if you have:\n\n* Incontinence\n* Recurrent blood in the urine\n* Inability to fully empty the bladder (urinary retention)\n* Recurrent urinary tract infections\n* Decreasing kidney function\n* Bladder stones\n* Bothersome symptoms not responding to medicines\n\nThe choice of which surgical procedure is recommended is most often based on the severity of your symptoms and the size and shape of your prostate gland. Most men who have prostate surgery have improvement in urine flow rates and symptoms.\n\nTransurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): This is the most common and most proven surgical treatment for BPH. TURP is performed by inserting a scope through the penis and removing the prostate piece by piece.\n\nSimple prostatectomy: This is a procedure to remove the inside part of the prostate gland. It is done through a surgical cut in your lower belly. This treatment is most often done on men who have very large prostate glands.\n\nOther less-invasive procedures use heat or a laser to destroy prostate tissue. Another less-invasive procedure works by \"tacking\" the prostate open without removing or destroying tissues. None have been proven to be better than TURP. People who receive these procedures are more likely to need surgery again after 5 or 10 years. However, these procedures may be a choice for:\n\n* Younger men (many of the less-invasive procedures carry a lower risk for impotence and incontinence than TURP, although the risk with TURP is not very high)\n* Older people\n* People with severe medical conditions, including uncontrolled diabetes, cirrhosis, alcoholism, psychosis, and serious lung, kidney, or heart disease\n* Men who are taking blood-thinning medicines\n* Men who are otherwise at an increased surgical risk\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nSome men may find it helpful to take part in a BPH support group.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nMen who have had BPH for long time with slowly worsening symptoms may develop:\n\n* Sudden inability to urinate (urinary retention)\n* Urinary tract infections\n* Urinary stones\n* Damage to the kidneys\n* Blood in the urine\n\nBPH may come back over time, even after having surgery.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider right away if you have:\n\n* Less urine than usual\n* Fever or chills\n* Back, side, or abdominal pain\n* Blood or pus in your urine\n\nAlso contact your provider if:\n\n* Your bladder does not feel completely empty after you urinate.\n* You take medicines that may cause urinary problems, such as diuretics, antihistamines, antidepressants, or sedatives. Do not stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider.\n* You have tried self-care steps for 2 months and symptoms have not improved.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nBPH; Benign prostatic hyperplasia (hypertrophy); Prostate - enlarged\n\n---\n\n**Enlarged Prostate**\n\n\\n\\nThe prostate is a gland that produces some of the fluid that carries sperm during ejaculation.

However, this is not a standard treatment for an enlarged prostate.\n\nSome facts about prostate enlargement:\n\n*   The likelihood of developing an enlarged prostate increases with age.\n*   BPH is so common that it has been said all men will have an enlarged prostate if they live long enough.\n*   A small amount of prostate enlargement is present in many men over age 40. More than 90% of men over age 80 have the condition.\n*   No risk factors have been identified, other than having normally-functioning testicles.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nLess than half of all men with BPH have symptoms of the disease. Symptoms may include:\n\n*   Frequent urination\n*   Difficulty starting to urinate\n*   Weak flow of urine\n*   Feeling like the bladder is not completely empty after urinating\n*   Painful or burning sensation while urinating\n\n---\n\n**Enlarged Prostate**\n\nThis is not a standard treatment for an enlarged prostate.\n\n**Some Facts About Prostate Enlargement**\n\n* Less than half of all men with BPH have symptoms of the disease.\n* Symptoms may include:\n\t+ Dribbling at the end of urinating\n\t+ Inability to urinate (urinary retention)\n\t+ Incomplete emptying of your bladder\n\t+ Incontinence\n\t+ Needing to urinate 2 or more times per night\n\t+ Pain with urination or bloody urine (these may indicate infection)\n\t+ Slowed or delayed start of the urinary stream\n\t+ Straining to urinate\n\t+ Strong and sudden urge to urinate\n\t+ Weak urine stream\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\n* Your health care provider will ask questions about your medical history.\n* A digital rectal exam will also be done to feel the prostate gland.\n* Other tests may include:\n\t+ Urine flow rate\n\t+ Post-void residual urine test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate\n\t+ Pressure-flow studies to measure the pressure in the bladder as you urinate\n\t+ Urinalysis to check for blood or infection\n\t+ Urine culture to check for infection\n\t+ Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test to screen for prostate cancer\n\t+ Cystoscopy\n\t+ Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine tests to check for reduced kidney function\n\n**Treatment**\n\n* The treatment you choose will be based on how bad your symptoms are and how much they bother you.\n* Your provider will also take into account other medical problems you may have.\n* Treatment options include \"watchful waiting,\" lifestyle changes, medicines, or surgery.\n\n**Self-Care**\n\nFor mild symptoms:\n\n* Urinate when you first get the urge\n* Go to the bathroom on a timed schedule, even if you don't feel a need to urinate\n* Avoid alcohol and caffeine, especially after dinner\n* Do not drink a lot of fluid all at once. Spread out fluids during the day. Avoid drinking fluids within 2 hours of bedtime\n* Try not to take over-the-counter cold and sinus medicines that contain decongestants or antihistamines\n* Keep warm and exercise regularly\n* Reduce stress\n\n**Medicines**\n\n* Alpha-1 blockers are a class of medicines, some of which have been used to treat high blood pressure. These medicines relax the muscles of the bladder neck and prostate.\n* Finasteride and dutasteride lower levels of hormones produced by the prostate.\n* Antibiotics may be prescribed to treat chronic prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate), which may occur with BPH.\n\n**Saw Palmetto**\n\nMany herbs have been tried for treating an enlarged prostate. Many men use saw palmetto to ease symptoms. Some studies have shown that it may help with symptoms, but results are mixed, and more research is needed.\n\n**Surgery**\n\nProstate surgery may be recommended if you have:\n\n* Incontinence\n* Recurrent blood in the urine\n* Inability to fully empty the bladder (urinary retention)\n* Recurrent urinary tract infections\n* Decreasing kidney function\n* Bladder stones\n* Bothersome symptoms not responding to medicines\n\nThe choice of which surgical procedure is recommended is most often based on the severity of your symptoms and the size and shape of your prostate gland.\n\n---\n\n**Enlarged Prostate**\n\nIf you are over 60, you are more likely to have symptoms. But many men with an enlarged prostate have only minor symptoms. Self-care steps are often enough to make you feel better.\n\nIf you have BPH, you should have a yearly assessment to monitor your symptoms and see if you need changes in treatment.\n\n**SELF-CARE**\n\nFor mild symptoms:\n\n* Urinate when you first get the urge.\n* Go to the bathroom on a timed schedule, even if you don't feel a need to urinate.\n* Avoid alcohol and caffeine, especially after dinner.\n* Do not drink a lot of fluid all at once. Spread out fluids during the day. Avoid drinking fluids within 2 hours of bedtime.\n* Try not to take over-the-counter cold and sinus medicines that contain decongestants or antihistamines. These medicines can increase BPH symptoms.\n* Keep warm and exercise regularly. Cold weather and lack of physical activity may worsen symptoms.\n* Reduce stress. Nervousness and tension can lead to more frequent urination.\n\n**MEDICINES**\n\nAlpha-1 blockers are a class of medicines, some of which have been used to treat high blood pressure. These medicines relax the muscles of the bladder neck and prostate. This allows easier urination. Most people who take alpha-1 blockers notice improvement in their symptoms, usually within 3 to 7 days after starting the medicine.\n\nFinasteride and dutasteride lower levels of hormones produced by the prostate. These medicines also reduce the size of the gland, increase urine flow rate, and decrease symptoms of BPH. You may need to take these medicines for 3 to 6 months before you notice symptoms getting better. Possible side effects include decreased sex drive and impotence.\n\nAntibiotics may be prescribed to treat chronic prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate), which may occur with BPH. BPH symptoms may improve in some men after a course of antibiotics.\n\nWatch out for medicines that may make your symptoms worse:\n\n**SAW PALMETTO**\n\nMany herbs have been tried for treating an enlarged prostate. Many men use saw palmetto to ease symptoms. Some studies have shown that it may help with symptoms, but results are mixed, and more research is needed. If you use saw palmetto and think it works, ask your provider if you should still take it.\n\n**SURGERY**\n\nProstate surgery may be recommended if you have:\n\n* Incontinence\n* Recurrent blood in the urine\n* Inability to fully empty the bladder (urinary retention)\n* Recurrent urinary tract infections\n* Decreasing kidney function\n* Bladder stones\n* Bothersome symptoms not responding to medicines\n\nThe choice of which surgical procedure is recommended is most often based on the severity of your symptoms and the size and shape of your prostate gland. Most men who have prostate surgery have improvement in urine flow rates and symptoms.\n\nTransurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): This is the most common and most proven surgical treatment for BPH. TURP is performed by inserting a scope through the penis and removing the prostate piece by piece.\n\nSimple prostatectomy: This is a procedure to remove the inside part of the prostate gland. It is done through a surgical cut in your lower belly. This treatment is most often done on men who have very large prostate glands.\n\nOther less-invasive procedures use heat or a laser to destroy prostate tissue. Another less-invasive procedure works by \"tacking\" the prostate open without removing or destroying tissues. None have been proven to be better than TURP. People who receive these procedures are more likely to need surgery again after 5 or 10 years. However, these procedures may be a choice for:\n\n* Younger men\n* Older people\n* People with severe medical conditions\n* Men who are taking blood-thinning medicines\n* Men who are otherwise at an increased surgical risk\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nSome men may find it helpful to take part in a BPH support group.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nMen who have had BPH for long time with slowly worsening symptoms may develop:\n\n* Sudden inability to urinate (urinary retention)\n* Urinary tract infections\n* Urinary stones\n* Damage to the kidneys\n* Blood in the urine\n\nBPH may come back over time, even after having surgery.\n\n---\n\n**Enlarged Prostate**\n\n**What is Enlarged Prostate?**\n\nEnlarged prostate, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland. It is one of the most common health issues affecting men over 50 years old.\n\n**Symptoms of Enlarged Prostate**\n\nThe symptoms of enlarged prostate can vary from person to person, but they often include:\n\n*   **Frequent Urination**: The need to urinate more frequently, especially at night\n*   **Urgent Urination**: A sudden, intense urge to urinate\n*   **Weak Urinary Stream**: A weak or interrupted flow of urine when urinating\n*   **Incomplete Emptying**: Feeling that the bladder is not completely empty after urinating\n*   **Urinary Retention**: Sudden inability to urinate\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of enlarged prostate is unknown, but it is believed to be related to hormonal changes, genetics, and lifestyle factors. Some risk factors include:\n\n*   **Age**: Enlarged prostate is more common in men over 50 years old\n*   **Family History**: Men with a family history of enlarged prostate are more likely to develop the condition\n*   **Obesity**: Being overweight or obese may increase the risk of developing enlarged prostate\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing enlarged prostate typically involves a physical exam, medical history, and diagnostic tests such as:\n\n*   **Digital Rectal Exam (DRE)**: A doctor inserts a gloved finger into the rectum to feel the prostate gland\n*   **Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Test**: A blood test that measures the level of PSA in the blood\n*   **Ultrasound**: An imaging test that uses sound waves to create images of the prostate gland\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nTreatment for enlarged prostate depends on the severity of symptoms and may include:\n\n*   **Watchful Waiting**: Monitoring symptoms and delaying treatment if they are mild\n*   **Medications**: Alpha blockers, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors to relax the muscles in the prostate and improve urine flow\n*   **Surgery**: Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), open prostatectomy, or laser surgery to remove excess tissue\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf you experience any of the following symptoms, contact your healthcare provider immediately:\n\n*   Less urine than usual\n*   Fever or chills\n*   Back, side, or abdominal pain\n*   Blood or pus in your urine\n\n---\n\n**Enlarged Prostate: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 7/7)**\n\n**Treatment of LUTS/BPH**\n\nIn: Morgia G, ed.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601210.html",
    "content": "**Enoxaparin Injection**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nEnoxaparin is used to prevent blood clots in the leg in patients who are on bedrest or who are having hip replacement, knee replacement, or stomach surgery. It is used in combination with aspirin to prevent complications from angina (chest pain) and heart attacks. It is also used in combination with warfarin to treat blood clots in the leg.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nEnoxaparin comes as an injection in a syringe to be injected just under the skin (subcutaneously) but not into your muscle. It is usually given twice a day. You will probably begin using the drug while you are in the hospital and then use it for a total of 10 to 14 days.\n\n*   Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n*   Use enoxaparin exactly as directed. Do not inject more or less of it or inject it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n*   Continue to use enoxaparin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking enoxaparin without talking to your doctor.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nIf you have epidural or spinal anesthesia or a spinal puncture while taking a 'blood thinner' such as enoxaparin, you are at risk for having a blood clot form in or around your spine that could cause you to become paralyzed. Tell your doctor if you are taking other anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin), anagrelide (Agrylin), aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, naproxen), cilostazol (Pletal), clopidogrel (Plavix), dipyridamole (Persantine), eptifibatide (Integrilin), prasugrel (Effient), sulfinpyrazone (Anturane), ticlopidine (Ticlid), and tirofiban (Aggrastat).\n\nIf you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: numbness, tingling, leg weakness or paralysis, and loss of control over your bladder or bowels.\n\nTalk to your doctor about the risk of taking enoxaparin. Keep all appointments with your doctor.\n\n---\n\n**Enoxaparin Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/3)**\n\n\\n\\n**Important Instructions**\n\n*   not inject more or less of it or inject it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n*   Continue to use enoxaparin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking enoxaparin without talking to your doctor.\n\n**How to Give Yourself the Shot**\n\nYour healthcare provider will teach you how to give yourself the shot or arrangements will be made for someone else to give you the shot. Enoxaparin is usually injected in the stomach area. You must use a different area of the stomach each time you give the shot. If you have questions about where to give the shot, ask your healthcare provider.\n\n**Using the Syringe and Needle**\n\nEach syringe has enough drug in it for one shot. Do not use the syringe and needle more than one time. Your doctor, pharmacist, or health care provider will tell you how to dispose of used needles and syringes to avoid accidental injury. Keep syringes and needles out of reach of children.\n\n**Injecting Enoxaparin**\n\nTo inject enoxaparin, follow these instructions:\n\n*   Wash your hands and the area of skin where you will give the shot.\n*   Look at the syringe to be sure the drug is clear and colorless or pale yellow.\n*   Take the cap off the needle. Do not push any air or drug out of the syringe before giving the shot unless your healthcare provider tells you to.\n*   Lie down and pinch a fold of skin between your finger and thumb. Push the entire needle into the skin and then press down on the syringe plunger to inject the drug. Hold onto the skin the entire time you give the shot. Do not rub the site after you give the shot.\n\n**Other Uses for This Medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n\\n\\n**What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n\nBefore taking enoxaparin, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to enoxaparin, heparin, any other drugs, or pork products. Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while receiving enoxaparin.\n\n\\n\\n**What Should I Do If I Forget a Dose?**\n\nInject the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not inject a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n\\n\\n**What Side Effects Can This Medication Cause?**\n\nEnoxaparin may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n*   upset stomach\n*   fever\n*   irritation or burning at site of injection\n\nIf you experience any of the following symptoms or those listed in the IMPORTANT WARNING section, call your doctor immediately:\n\n*   unusual bleeding or bruising\n*   black or bloody stools\n*   blood in urine\n*   swollen ankles and/or feet\n\n---\n\n**Enoxaparin Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/3)**\n\n* **Important Warning Symptoms:** If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately:\n\t+ Unusual bleeding or bruising\n\t+ Black or bloody stools\n\t+ Blood in urine\n\t+ Swollen ankles and/or feet\n* **Reporting Adverse Events:** If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online at https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch or by phone at 1-800-332-1088.\n* **Storage and Disposal:** Keep this medication out of reach of children.

    "content": "**Ensifentrine Oral Inhalation**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nEnsifentrine oral inhalation is used to control wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; a group of diseases that affect the lungs and airways, that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema). Ensifentrine is in a class of medications called phosphodiesterase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of certain natural substances in the body that cause inflammation and muscle tightness in the lungs, which results in relaxing and opening air passages in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nEnsifentrine comes as a suspension (liquid) to inhale by mouth using a nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled). It is usually inhaled twice a day, in the morning and in the evening. Inhale ensifentrine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use ensifentrine exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nDo not use ensifentrine during a sudden COPD attack. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting (rescue) inhaler to use during COPD attacks.\n\nCall your doctor or get emergency medical help if your breathing problems worsen, if you have to use your short-acting inhaler to treat attacks of COPD more often, or if your short-acting inhaler does not relieve your symptoms.\n\nEnsifentrine controls COPD but does not cure it. Continue to use ensifentrine even if you feel well. Do not stop using ensifentrine without talking to your doctor. If you stop using ensifentrine, your symptoms may get worse.\n\nBefore you use ensifentrine for the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use the nebulizer and compressor. Practice using the nebulizer and compressor while he or she watches.\n\nEnsifentrine oral inhalation should be used only in a standard jet nebulizer with a mouthpiece connected to an air compressor. Do not swallow or inject ensifentrine nebulizer suspension. Do not mix the solution with anything else.\n\nTo inhale the suspension using a jet nebulizer, follow these steps:\n\n1. Remove one ampule of inhalation suspension from the foil pouch.\n2. Shake the ampule well to mix the medication evenly. After shaking, ensifentrine inhalation suspension should be cloudy and yellow to pale yellow.\n3. Twist off the top of one ampule of ensifentrine suspension and squeeze all of the liquid into the nebulizer reservoir. Do not mix other medications with ensifentrine in the reservoir.\n4. Connect the mouthpiece to the nebulizer reservoir. Connect the nebulizer to the compressor.\n5. Sit in an upright, comfortable position. Place the mouthpiece in your mouth or put on the face mask.\n6. Turn on the compressor.\n7. Breathe in calmly, deeply, and evenly for about 5 to 7 minutes until mist stops forming in the nebulizer chamber.\n8. Dispose of the empty ampule and its top in a trash can that is out of the reach of children and pets.\n9. Clean your nebulizer regularly. Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about cleaning your nebulizer.\n\nAsk your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.\n\n---\n\n**Ensifentrine Oral Inhalation: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Using the Nebulizer**\n\nTo inhale the suspension using a jet nebulizer, follow these steps:\n\n*   Remove one ampule of inhalation suspension from the foil pouch.\n*   Shake the ampule well to mix the medication evenly.

    "content": "**Enteroclysis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Enteroclysis?**\n\nEnteroclysis is an imaging test of the small intestine. The test looks at how a liquid called contrast material moves through the small intestine.\n\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\nThis test is done in a radiology department. Depending on the need, x-ray, CT scan, or MRI imaging is used.\n\nThe test involves the following:\n\n*   Your health care provider inserts a tube through your nose or mouth into your stomach and into the beginning of the small bowel.\n*   Contrast material and air flow through the tube, and images are taken.\n*   The provider can watch on a monitor as the contrast moves through the bowel.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nFollow your provider's instructions on how to prepare for the test, which may include:\n\n*   Drinking clear liquids for at least 24 hours before the test.\n*   Not eating or drinking anything for several hours before the test. Your provider will tell you exactly how many hours.\n*   Taking laxatives to clear the bowels.\n*   Not taking certain medicines. Your provider will tell you which ones. Do not stop taking any medicines on your own. Ask your provider first.\n\n**How Will I Feel During the Test?**\n\nThe placement of the tube may be uncomfortable. The contrast material may cause a feeling of abdominal fullness.\n\n**Why is the Test Performed?**\n\nThis test is performed to examine the small bowel. It is one way of telling if the small intestine is normal.\n\n**What are Normal Results?**\n\nThere are no problems seen with the size or shape of the small intestine. Contrast travels through the bowel at a normal rate without any sign of blockage.\n\n**What do Abnormal Results Mean?**\n\nMany problems of the small intestine can be found with enteroclysis. Some of these include:\n\n*   Inflammation of the small bowel (such as Crohn disease)\n*   Small bowel isn't absorbing nutrients normally (malabsorption)\n*   Narrowing or stricture of the intestine\n*   Small bowel blockage\n*   Tumors of the small intestine\n\n**Risks**\n\nThe radiation exposure may be greater with this test than with other types of x-rays because of the length of time. But most experts feel that the risk is low compared to the benefits.\n\nPregnant women and children are more sensitive to the risks of x-ray radiation. Rare complications of enteroclysis include:\n\n*   Allergic reactions to medicines prescribed for the test (your provider can tell you which medicines)\n*   Possible injury to bowel structures during the study\n\nBarium may cause constipation. Tell your provider if the barium has not passed through your system by 2 or 3 days after the test, or if you feel constipated.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nSmall bowel enema; CT enteroclysis; Small bowel follow-through; Barium enteroclysis; MR enteroclysis\n\n---\n\n**Enteroclysis**\n\nEnteroclysis is an imaging test of the small intestine.

You may be asked to change positions during the exam. The test may last a few hours, because it takes a while for the contrast to move through all of the small bowel.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nFollow your provider's instructions on how to prepare for the test, which may include:\n\n* Drinking clear liquids for at least 24 hours before the test.\n* Not eating or drinking anything for several hours before the test. Your provider will tell you exactly how many hours.\n* Taking laxatives to clear the bowels.\n* Not taking certain medicines. Your provider will tell you which ones. Do not stop taking any medicines on your own. Ask your provider first.\n\nIf you are anxious about the procedure, you may be given a sedative before it starts. You will be asked to remove all jewelry and wear a hospital gown. It is best to leave jewelry and other valuables at home. You will be asked to remove any removable dental work, such as appliances, bridges, or retainers.\n\nIf you are, or think you're pregnant, tell your provider before the test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nThe placement of the tube may be uncomfortable.
