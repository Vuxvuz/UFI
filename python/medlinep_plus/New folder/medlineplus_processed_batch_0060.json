    "content": "**Dwarfism**\n\nAlso called: Little person\n\nPeople with dwarfism have short stature. This means that their height is under 4' 10\" as an adult. They are usually of normal intelligence. Dwarfism most often does happen in families where both parents are of average height.\n\n**Causes of Dwarfism**\n\nMore than 300 different conditions can cause dwarfism. Achondroplasia is the most common type of dwarfism. Achondroplasia is a genetic condition that affects about 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 40,000 people. It makes your arms and legs short in comparison to your head and trunk. You may also have a larger head and weak muscle tone. Other genetic conditions, kidney disease, and problems with metabolism or hormones can also cause dwarfism.\n\n**Health Problems Associated with Dwarfism**\n\nThe conditions that cause dwarfism can also cause other health problems. Most of them are treatable. It is important to have regular checkups throughout your life. With proper medical care, most people with dwarfism have active lives and live as long as other people.\n\n**Resources**\n\n*   Achondroplasia: About the Disease  (Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center)\n*   Dwarfism (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research)\n*   Dwarfism (For Parents) (Nemours Foundation)\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\nGenetic Testing (For Parents)  (Nemours Foundation)\n\n**Genetics**\n\n*   3-M syndrome: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Achondrogenesis: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Achondroplasia: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Anauxetic dysplasia: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Atelosteogenesis type 2: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Campomelic dysplasia: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Cartilage-hair hypoplasia: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Diastrophic dysplasia: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Fibrochondrogenesis: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Hypochondrogenesis: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Hypochondroplasia: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Isolated growth hormone deficiency: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Kniest dysplasia: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Laron syndrome: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Meier-Gorlin syndrome: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Metatropic dysplasia: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Osteoglophonic dysplasia: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Robinow syndrome: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Saul-Wilson syndrome: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, Strudwick type: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Spondylothoracic dysostosis: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n*   Thanatophoric dysplasia: MedlinePlus Genetics  (National Library of Medicine)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nClinicalTrials.gov: Achondroplasia  (National Institutes of Health)\nClinicalTrials.gov: Dwarfism  (National Institutes of Health)\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nReferences and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\n\n*   Impact of growth hormone therapy on bone and body composition in...\n*   CDK4 loss-of-function mutations cause microcephaly and short stature.\n*   Long-Term Efficacy and Safety of Growth Hormone in Children Suffering from...\n\n**Find an Expert**\n\nEunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\n\n---\n\n**Dwarfism**\n\nIn comparison to your head and trunk, you may have shorter arms and legs.

It can be caused by various genetic disorders, hormonal imbalances, or other medical conditions.\n\n**Types of Dwarfism**\n\nThere are several types of dwarfism, including:\n\n*   **Achondroplasia**: The most common form of short-limbed dwarfism, accounting for approximately 70-75% of all cases.\n*   **Campomelic dysplasia**: A rare genetic disorder that affects bone development and can lead to skeletal deformities.\n*   **Diastrophic dysplasia**: A condition characterized by short stature, clubfoot, and other skeletal abnormalities.\n*   **Dwarfism (general)**: A term used to describe various forms of short stature.\n*   **Ellis-van Creveld syndrome**: A rare genetic disorder that affects bone development and can lead to skeletal deformities.\n*   **Hypochondroplasia**: A mild form of dwarfism characterized by short stature and limited joint mobility.\n*   **Kniest dysplasia**: A rare genetic disorder that affects cartilage and bone development.\n*   **Primordial dwarfism**: The rarest and most severe form of dwarfism, often associated with other health problems.\n\n**Causes and Treatment**\n\nThe causes of dwarfism vary depending on the type. Some forms are inherited, while others may be caused by hormonal imbalances or other medical conditions. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause and can include hormone replacement therapy, growth hormone injections, or surgery to correct skeletal deformities.\n\n**Resources**\n\nFor parents seeking information on dwarfism, the Nemours Foundation provides a wealth of resources, including articles and expert advice. The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is also a valuable resource for research and treatment options.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\nGrowth disorders are a related health topic, as they can be caused by hormonal imbalances or other medical conditions that affect growth and development.",

Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive:\n\n*   Blood and urine tests\n*   Breathing support, including oxygen through a tube into the lungs, and a breathing machine (ventilator)\n*   Bronchoscopy -- camera down the throat to look for burns in the airways and lungs (if the poison was aspirated)\n*   Chest x-ray\n*   Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n*   Endoscopy -- camera down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and the stomach\n*   Fluids through a vein (by IV)\n*   Medicine to reverse the effect of the poison and treat symptoms\n*   Surgical removal of burned skin (skin debridement)\n*   Tube through the mouth into the stomach to aspirate (suck out) the stomach. This is done only when the person gets medical care within 30 to 45 minutes of the poisoning, and a very large amount of the substance has been swallowed\n*   Washing of the skin (irrigation) -- perhaps every few hours for several days\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster the person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\n\nIf the poisoning involved a corrosive alkali, extensive damage may occur to the:\n\n*   Esophagus\n*   Kidneys\n*   Mouth\n*   Stomach\n*   Throat\n\nThe outcome depends on the extent of this damage. Poisoning from dye containing an alkali may result in continuing injury to these tissues for weeks or months.\n\nSwallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue death. This may result in infection, shock, and death, even several months after substance was swallowed. Scar tissue in the affected areas can lead to long-term problems with breathing, swallowing, and digestion.\n\n---\n\n**Dye Remover Poisoning**\n\n\\n\\n**Causes of Long-Term Problems**\n\nInfection, shock, and death can occur even several months after the substance was swallowed.

    "content": "**Dysphagia Tests**\n\n**What are dysphagia tests?**\n\nDysphagia is a term that means difficulty swallowing. Usually, when you swallow, food moves easily from your mouth, down your throat, and into your stomach. During this process, the food travels through a muscular tube called the esophagus.\n\nIt's normal to occasionally have trouble swallowing, such as if you don't chew some food well enough or if you eat too fast. But if you have dysphagia, trouble swallowing is an ongoing problem. It can take more time and effort to move food from your mouth to your stomach. When you try to swallow liquids, food, or even your saliva, you may cough or choke. Swallowing may be uncomfortable or painful, and these issues may even stop you from swallowing.\n\nDysphagia can happen at any age, but it's more common if you are an older adult or if you have certain neurologic diseases. Many different conditions can cause dysphagia, and some of them can be very serious.\n\n**What are they used for?**\n\nDysphagia tests are used to find out why you have trouble swallowing.\n\n**Why do I need a dysphagia test?**\n\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms of dysphagia. These can include:\n\n* Coughing or gagging when swallowing\n* Feeling of food being stuck in your throat\n* Pain when swallowing\n* Being unable to swallow\n* Food or liquids coming back up through your throat or mouth, including from GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)\n* Frequent heartburn\n* A hoarse or weaker voice\n* Weight loss\n* Drooling\n\nIf food has gotten stuck in your airway and you're having trouble breathing, call 911 for help right away.\n\n**What happens during a dysphagia test?**\n\nThere are several different types of dysphagia tests. A radiologist or a radiology technician most often does these tests. A radiologist is a doctor who specializes in using imaging tests to diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. Depending on your symptoms, you may have one or more of the following tests:\n\n* **Bedside Swallow Screen**\n\t+ You will sit upright in a bed or chair.\n\t+ A health care provider may ask you questions about your symptoms and how long you've had trouble swallowing.\n\t+ You may be asked to do certain movements, such as smacking your lips together or sticking out your jaw.\n\t+ You will be given different foods and drinks to swallow. These may include water, other liquids, soft foods, and solid foods.\n\t+ The provider will check your teeth, lips, jaw, cheeks, and neck while you swallow.\n* **Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallow (FEES)**\n\t+ You will sit upright in a bed or chair.\n\t+ A provider will slide an endoscope (a thin, flexible tube with a light and camera) into your nose and to the back of your throat.\n\t+ You will eat bits of food and/or drink liquids that may be colored with a dye.\n\t+ The endoscope allows your provider to watch food travel down your throat as you swallow.\n* **Upper Endoscopy**\n\t+ You will lie on your side on an exam table.\n\t+ An IV (intravenous) line will be placed in your arm or hand.\n\t+ Medicine to relax you will be injected intravenously (by IV).\n\t+ Your provider may spray a numbing medicine on the back of your throat.\n\t+ Once the relaxing and numbing medicines have taken effect, your provider will insert an endoscope into your mouth and throat.\n\t+ The endoscope will take pictures of your esophagus, stomach, and part of your small intestine.\n\t+ The tube may also have a tool attached that can be used to take a biopsy (removal of a small sample of tissue) to examine after the procedure.\n* **Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS), also known as a Modified Barium Swallow**\n\t+ You will stand or sit on an x-ray table.\n\t+ You will be given different foods and liquids covered with barium. Barium is a substance that coats your internal organs and tissues so they can be seen more clearly on an x-ray. This allows your provider to see how you swallow.\n\t+ While you swallow, a special x-ray called fluoroscopy will track the barium-coated food in real-time as a live video as it moves through your mouth, throat, and esophagus.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYour provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow. You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours or more before your test. You may be asked to avoid doing anything that will coat your throat, such as smoking, chewing gum, or sucking on hard candy.\n\nYou may need to stop taking certain medicines before the test, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\nYou may also want to make a list of your swallowing problems ahead of time. Then, you can share them with your provider during your test.\n\nIf you are having an upper endoscopy, you will be given a medicine that can make you drowsy, so you should arrange for someone to take you home.\n\n**Are there any risks to the tests?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a bedside swallow, but there is a small chance that fluid might get into your lungs during the procedure.\n\nDuring a FEES or upper endoscopy, you may feel some discomfort when the endoscope is inserted, but serious complications are rare. There is a very small risk of getting a tear in your intestine. If you had a biopsy, there is a small risk of bleeding at the site. Bleeding usually stops without treatment.\n\nYou should not have a VFSS, which is a type of x-ray, if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. The radiation from these x-rays can be harmful to a developing baby. For others, there is little risk to having these tests. The radiation dose is very low and not considered harmful for most people. But talk to your provider about all the x-rays you've had in the past. The risks from radiation exposure may be linked to the number of x-ray treatments you've had over time.\n\nTell your provider if you have any known allergies to the barium used in the test. Your poop may look white for several days after the test as you pass the barium. You may have constipation if all the barium doesn't pass out of your body.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nYour results may show your provider where the problem is or what type of dysphagia you might have. These can include:\n\n* **Oral cavity dysphagia**, a disorder of the mouth in which you have difficulty chewing or breaking down food. Causes may include:\n\t+ Weakness after a stroke\n\t+ Muscular or nerve problems\n* **Oropharyngeal dysphagia**, a disorder of the throat in which you have difficulty starting to swallow. Causes may include:\n\t+ Certain types of cancer\n\t+ Neurologic diseases such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease\n\t+ Pharyngoesophageal diverticulum, a small pouch that forms and collects food particles in your throat\n* **Esophageal dysphagia**, a disorder of the esophagus in which you have difficulty moving food down your esophagus. Causes may include:\n\t+ Esophageal stricture (narrowing of your esophagus)\n\t+ Esophageal cancer\n\t+ GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), a condition in which the contents of your stomach leak backward into your esophagus\n\n---\n\n**Dysphagia Tests**\n\n**What are they used for?**\n\nDysphagia tests are used to find out why you have trouble swallowing.\n\n**Why do I need a dysphagia test?**\n\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms of dysphagia.

This can make eating challenging and may lead to difficulties in consuming sufficient calories and fluids to nourish the body.\n\n**Who Can Be Affected?**\n\nAnyone can develop a swallowing disorder, but it is more common among older adults. It often arises as a result of other conditions, including:\n\n*   Nervous system disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and cerebral palsy\n*   Problems with the esophagus, like GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)\n*   Stroke\n*   Head or spinal cord injury\n*   Cancer of the head, neck, or esophagus\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nMedicines can be beneficial for some individuals, while others may require surgery. Swallowing treatment with a speech-language pathologist can also be helpful. You may find it useful to adjust your diet or maintain a specific posture when eating. In severe cases, people may need feeding tubes.\n\n**National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders**\n\nThe National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders provides valuable information and resources for individuals affected by swallowing disorders.\n\n---\n\n**Dysphagia**\n\nWhile some people with dysphagia may be able to manage their symptoms through lifestyle changes, such as changing their diet or holding their head or neck in a certain way when eating, others may require more intensive treatment. In severe cases, individuals may need to undergo surgery or have a feeding tube inserted.\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\n*   **Barium Swallow**: A diagnostic test that uses a liquid containing barium to visualize the swallowing process.\n*   **Dysphagia Tests**: A series of tests designed to assess swallowing function, including the barium swallow study.\n*   **Tailored Barium Swallow Study**: A customized approach to diagnosing dysphagia using barium swallow studies.\n*   **Upper GI Endoscopy**: A procedure that allows a doctor to visually examine the upper digestive tract.\n\n**Living With Dysphagia**\n\nFor individuals with swallowing problems, adapting their diet and eating habits can be an effective way to manage symptoms. This may involve eating smaller, more frequent meals or avoiding certain foods that are difficult to swallow.\n\n**Related Issues**\n\n*   **Globus**: A condition characterized by a persistent sensation of having something stuck in the throat.\n*   **Oromandibular Dystonia**: A neurological disorder that affects the muscles involved in swallowing and speech.\n*   **Trouble Swallowing After Stroke**: Dysphagia can be a complication of stroke, particularly if the stroke affects the brainstem or other areas responsible for swallowing function.\n\n**Genetics**\n\nSome forms of dysphagia are associated with genetic disorders. For example, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy is a rare condition that affects the muscles involved in swallowing and eye movement.\n\n**Videos and Tutorials**\n\n*   **Swallowing**: A tutorial on the mechanics of swallowing, including the role of the tongue, lips, and other oral structures.\n*   **Deglutition Disorders**: A video explaining the causes and symptoms of dysphagia.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nResearchers are continually exploring new treatments for dysphagia. Clinical trials may offer opportunities for individuals with swallowing disorders to participate in innovative therapies.\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nRecent studies have investigated various aspects of dysphagia, including its impact on quality of life, the effectiveness of different treatment approaches, and the role of genetics in determining susceptibility to the condition.\n\n**Reference Desk**\n\nThe digestive system is a complex network of organs and structures responsible for breaking down food, absorbing nutrients, and eliminating waste. Understanding how it works can provide valuable insights into the causes and consequences of dysphagia.\n\n**Find an Expert**\n\nIf you or a loved one is experiencing symptoms of dysphagia, consulting with a qualified healthcare professional can help determine the best course of action.\n\n**Patient Handouts**\n\n*   **Esophageal Manometry**: A diagnostic test that measures the pressure and function of the esophagus.\n*   **Painful Swallowing**: A condition characterized by discomfort or pain during swallowing.\n*   **Swallowing Difficulty**: A symptom that can manifest in various ways, including difficulty initiating or maintaining a swallow.\n*   **Swallowing Problems**: A general term encompassing a range of symptoms and conditions related to impaired swallowing function.",

Most of the time, it does not cause any problems. However, certain types (or strains) of E coli can cause food poisoning. One strain (E coli O157:H7) can cause a severe case of food poisoning.\n\nBacteria may get into your food in different ways:\n\n* Meat or poultry may come into contact with normal bacteria from the intestines of an animal while it is being processed.\n* Water used during growing or shipping may contain animal or human waste.\n* Food may be handled in an unsafe way during transport or storage.\n* Unsafe food handling or preparation may occur in grocery stores, restaurants, or homes.\n\nFood poisoning can occur after eating or drinking:\n\n* Food prepared by a person who did not wash hands well\n* Food prepared using unclean cooking utensils, cutting boards, or other tools\n* Dairy products or food containing mayonnaise (such as coleslaw or potato salad) that have been out of the refrigerator too long\n* Frozen or refrigerated foods that are not stored at the proper temperature or are not properly reheated\n* Fish or oysters\n* Raw fruits or vegetables that have not been washed well\n* Raw vegetable or fruit juices and dairy products\n* Undercooked meats or eggs\n* Water from a well or stream, or city or town water that has not been treated\n\nAlthough not common, E coli can be spread from one person to another. This may happen when someone does not wash their hands after a bowel movement and then touches other objects or someone else's hands.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms occur when E coli bacteria enter the intestine. Most of the time symptoms develop 24 to 72 hours after being infected. The most common symptom is sudden, severe diarrhea that is often bloody.\n\nOther symptoms may include:\n\n* Fever\n* Gas\n* Loss of appetite\n* Stomach cramping\n* Vomiting (rare)\n\nSymptoms of a rare but severe E coli infection include:\n\n* Bruises that happen easily\n* Pale skin\n* Red or bloody urine\n* Reduced amount of urine\n* Kidney failure\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. A stool culture or similar test can be done to check for disease-causing E coli.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nMost of the time, you will recover from the most common types of E coli infection within a couple of days. The goal of treatment is to make you feel better and avoid dehydration.

They often look like cigarettes, but work differently. Using an e-cigarette is called vaping. The user puffs on the mouthpiece of a cartridge. This causes a vaporizer to heat the liquid inside the cartridge. The liquid contains nicotine, flavorings, and other chemicals. The heated liquid turns into the vapor that is inhaled.\n\nSome people think that e-cigarettes are safer than cigarettes, and that they can be used to help people quit smoking. But not much is known about the health risks of using them, or whether they do help people quit smoking. However we do know about some dangers of e-cigarettes:\n\n* They contain nicotine, which is addictive\n* They contain other potentially harmful chemicals\n* There is a link between e-cigarette use and tobacco cigarette use in teens\n* The liquid in e-cigarettes can cause nicotine poisoning if someone drinks, sniffs, or touches it\n\n**Learn More**\n\nE-cigarettes and E-hookahs (Medical Encyclopedia)\nAlso in Spanish\nE-Cigarettes and Pregnancy (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\nE-Cigs, Menthol, and Dip  (National Cancer Institute, Tobacco Control Research Branch)\nHow to Properly Store E-Liquids and Prevent Accidental Exposure of E-Liquids to Children (Food and Drug Administration)\nAlso in Spanish\nRisks of Vaping: A Look at Safety  (National Institutes of Health)\nAlso in Spanish\nSecondhand Smoke and Electronic-Cigarette Aerosols (Environmental Protection Agency)\nVaping Devices (Electronic Cigarettes) DrugFacts  (National Institute on Drug Abuse)\nAlso in Spanish\nVaping: What Parents Should Know (Nemours Foundation)\nAlso in Spanish\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nClinicalTrials.gov: Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems  (National Institutes of Health)\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\nReferences and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\nArticle: Patient perceptions of the use of e-cigarettes in smoking treatment programs:... \nArticle: Lung lipids associated with smoking and ECIG use in a cross-sectional... \nArticle: Nicotine in E-cigarette aerosol may lead to pulmonary inflammation.",

Do not add anything to e-cigarette, vaping, or other products you purchase, even from retail businesses.\n\nOther safety concerns include:\n\n*   There is no evidence that shows these products are safe to use over the long term.\n*   These products can contain many harmful substances such as heavy metals and cancer-causing chemicals.\n*   The ingredients in e-cigarettes are not labeled, so it is not clear what's in them.\n*   It is not known how much nicotine is in each cartridge.\n*   It is not known if these devices are a safe or effective way to quit smoking. They are not approved as a quit-smoking aid.\n*   Non-smokers may start using e-cigarettes because they believe these devices are safe.\n\n\\n\\n**E-cigarettes and Children**\n\nMany experts also have concerns about the effects of these products on children.\n\nThese products are the most commonly used tobacco product in young people.\nThese products are sold in flavors that may appeal to children and teens, such as chocolate and key lime pie. This could lead to more nicotine addiction in children.\nTeens who use e-cigarettes may be more likely to take up smoking regular cigarettes.\n\n\\n\\n**More Studies are Needed**\n\nThere is emerging information about e-cigarettes to suggest they are harmful. Until more is known about their long-term effects, the FDA and the American Cancer Association recommend steering clear of these devices.\n\nIf you are trying to quit smoking, your best bet is to use FDA-approved smoking cessation aids. These include:\n\n*   Nicotine gum\n*   Lozenges\n*   Skin patches\n*   Nasal spray and oral inhaled products\n\n---\n\n**E-cigarettes and E-hookahs: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 4/5)**\n\nIf you are trying to quit smoking, your best bet is to use FDA-approved smoking cessation aids.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003931.htm",
    "content": "**EEG: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 1/5)**\n\nAn electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test to measure the electrical activity of the brain.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThe test is done by an EEG technologist in your health care provider's office or at a hospital or lab. You lie on your back on a bed or in a reclining chair, and flat metal disks called electrodes are placed on many spots on your scalp. The disks are held in place with a sticky paste. The electrodes are connected by wires to a recording machine. The machine changes the electrical signals into patterns that can be seen on a monitor or drawn on paper.\n\nYou need to lie still during the test with your eyes closed, as movement can change the results. You may be asked to do certain things during the test, such as breathe fast and deeply for several minutes or look at a bright flashing light. You may also be asked to sleep during the test.\n\nIf your provider needs to monitor your brain activity for a longer period, an ambulatory EEG will be ordered. In addition to the electrodes, you will wear or carry a special recorder for up to 3 days. You will be able to go about your normal routine as the EEG is being recorded. Alternatively, your provider may ask you to stay overnight in a special EEG monitoring unit where your brain activity will be monitored continuously.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nTo prepare for the test, wash your hair the night before and do not use conditioner, oils, sprays, or gel on your hair. If you have a hair weave, ask your provider for special instructions. Your provider may also want you to stop taking certain medicines before the test.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nAn EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain, which can be used to diagnose or monitor various health conditions, including seizures and epilepsy, brain diseases, coma, fainting spells, head injuries, behavioral changes, tumors, and sleep disorders.\n\n---\n\n**EEG: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 2/5)**\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\n*   Wash your hair the night before the test. Do not use conditioner, oils, sprays, or gel on your hair.\n*   If you have a hair weave, ask your provider for special instructions.\n*   Your provider may want you to stop taking certain medicines before the test. Do not change or stop taking any medicines without first talking to your provider. Bring a list of your medicines with you.\n*   Avoid all food and drinks containing caffeine for 8 hours before the test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nThe electrodes may feel sticky and strange on your scalp, but should not cause any other discomfort. You should not feel any discomfort during the test.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nBrain cells communicate with each other by producing tiny electrical signals, called impulses. An EEG measures this activity. It can be used to diagnose or monitor the following health conditions:\n\n*   Seizures and epilepsy\n*   Brain diseases, such rapidly progressing dementia or certain infections (encephalitis)\n*   Coma\n*   Fainting spells or periods of memory loss that cannot be explained otherwise\n*   Head injuries\n*   Behavioral changes\n*   Tumors or other lesions\n*   Critical illness in newborn babies\n\nEEG is also used to:\n\n*   Evaluate problems with sleep (sleep disorders)\n*   Monitor the brain during brain surgery\n\nAn EEG may be done to show that the brain has no activity, in the case of someone who is in a deep coma. It can be helpful when trying to decide if a person is brain dead.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nBrain electrical activity has a certain number of waves per second (frequencies) that are normal for different levels of alertness. For example, brain waves are faster when you are awake and slower in certain stages of sleep.\n\nThere are also normal patterns to these waves.\n\nNote: A normal EEG does not mean that a seizure did not occur.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal results on an EEG test may be due to:\n\n*   Abnormal bleeding (hemorrhage) in the brain\n*   An abnormal structure in the brain (such as a brain tumor)\n*   Tissue death due to a blockage in blood flow (cerebral infarction, also called a stroke)\n*   Medicines\n*   Illicit drug or alcohol use\n*   Head injury\n*   Migraines (in some cases)\n*   Seizure disorder (such as epilepsy)\n*   Sleep disorder (such as narcolepsy)\n*   Brain infection\n*   Kidney or liver disease (metabolic disease)\n\n**Risks**\n\nAn EEG test is very safe. The flashing lights or fast breathing (hyperventilation) required during the test may trigger seizures in those with seizure disorders. The provider performing the EEG is trained to take care of you if this happens.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nElectroencephalogram; Brain wave test; Epilepsy - EEG; Seizure - EEG\n\n---\n\n**EEG Test**\n\n**How the Test is Done**\n\nThe EEG test is done by attaching electrodes to your scalp. You will lie down on an examination table and the electrodes will be placed on your head using a special adhesive. The test can take anywhere from 15 minutes to several days, depending on what your healthcare provider needs to monitor.\n\nIf your provider needs to monitor your brain activity for a longer period, an ambulatory EEG will be ordered. In addition to the electrodes, you will wear or carry a special recorder for up to 3 days. You will be able to go about your normal routine as the EEG is being recorded. Or, your provider may ask you to stay overnight in a special EEG monitoring unit where your brain activity will be monitored continuously.\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\nBefore the test, wash your hair the night before and do not use conditioner, oils, sprays, or gel on your hair. If you have a hair weave, ask your provider for special instructions. Your provider may also want you to stop taking certain medicines before the test. Do not change or stop taking any medicines without first talking to your provider.\n\nAvoid all food and drinks containing caffeine for 8 hours before the test. You may need to sleep during the test, so reduce your sleep time the night before if instructed to do so. If you are asked to sleep as little as possible before the test, do not eat or drink any caffeine, energy drinks, or other products that help you stay awake.\n\n**What to Expect During the Test**\n\nThe electrodes may feel sticky and strange on your scalp, but should not cause any other discomfort. You should not feel any discomfort during the test.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nAn EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain. It can be used to diagnose or monitor various health conditions, including seizures and epilepsy, brain diseases, coma, fainting spells, head injuries, behavioral changes, tumors, and critical illness in newborn babies.\n\nEEG is also used to evaluate problems with sleep (sleep disorders) and monitor the brain during brain surgery.

Because of sedation, you may not feel any discomfort and have no memory of the test.\n\n**Why is the EGD performed?**\n\nEGD may be done if you have symptoms that are new, cannot be explained, or are not responding to treatment, such as:\n\n* Black or tarry stools or vomiting blood\n* Bringing food back up (regurgitation)\n* Feeling full sooner than normal or after eating less than usual\n* Feeling like food is stuck behind the breastbone\n* Heartburn\n* Low blood count (anemia) that cannot be explained\n* Pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen\n* Swallowing problems or pain with swallowing\n* Weight loss that cannot be explained\n\nYour health care provider may also order this test if you:\n\n* Have cirrhosis of the liver, to look for swollen veins (called varices) in the walls of the lower part of the esophagus, which may begin to bleed\n* Have Crohn disease\n* Need more follow-up or treatment for a condition that has been diagnosed\n\n**What are the risks of the test?**\n\nThere is a small chance of a hole (perforation) in the stomach, duodenum, or esophagus from the scope moving through these areas. There is also a small risk of bleeding at the biopsy site.\n\nYou could have a reaction to the medicine used during the procedure, which could cause:\n\n* Apnea (not breathing)\n* Difficulty breathing (respiratory depression)\n* Excessive sweating\n* Low blood pressure (hypotension)\n* Slow heartbeat (bradycardia)\n* Spasm of the larynx (laryngospasm)\n\n**What do abnormal results mean?**\n\nAn abnormal EGD may be the result of:\n\n* Celiac disease (damage to the lining of the small intestine from a reaction to eating gluten)\n* Esophageal varices (swollen veins in the lining of the esophagus caused by liver cirrhosis)\n* Esophagitis (lining of the esophagus becomes inflamed or swollen)\n* Gastritis (lining of the stomach and duodenum is inflamed or swollen)\n* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (a condition in which food or liquid from the stomach leaks backward into the esophagus)\n* Hiatal hernia (a condition in which part of the stomach sticks up into the chest through an opening in the diaphragm)\n* Mallory-Weiss syndrome (tear in the esophagus)\n* Narrowing or stricture of the esophagus, such as from a condition called an esophageal ring\n* Tumors or cancer in the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum (first part of small intestine)\n* Ulcers, gastric (stomach) or duodenal (small intestine)\n\n**What are the normal results of the test?**\n\nThe esophagus, stomach, and duodenum should be smooth and of normal color. There should be no bleeding, growths, ulcers, or inflammation.\n\n---\n\n**Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)**\n\n**What is an EGD?**\n\nAn esophagogastroduodenoscopy, also known as an upper endoscopy or gastroscopy, is a procedure used to diagnose and treat problems in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.\n\n**How is an EGD performed?**\n\nDuring an EGD, a flexible tube with a camera and light on the end is inserted through the mouth and guided into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. The procedure takes about 30-60 minutes to complete.\n\n**What are the risks of an EGD?**\n\nThere are some risks associated with an EGD, including:\n\n* Bleeding at the biopsy site\n* Reaction to the medicine used during the procedure\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\nIf you have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), your doctor may recommend that you follow a special diet before the procedure.\n\n**Images**\n\n* Gastric endoscopy\n* Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)\n\n**References**\n\nKoch MA, Zurad EG.

Now that it's over, let's talk about what to expect next.\n\n**Right After the Test**\n\nYou'll be taken to a recovery area where you may feel groggy and not remember how you got there. Don't worry, this is normal. The nurse will check your blood pressure and pulse, and remove your IV. Your doctor will come to explain the results of the test, so be sure to ask them to write it down for you.\n\n**Final Results**\n\nIf tissue biopsies were taken during the procedure, final results may take up to 1-3 weeks to come in.\n\n**Getting Home**\n\nSince the medicines you received can affect your thinking and memory, it's not safe for you to drive a car or find your own way home. Ask a friend or family member to take you home instead.\n\n**Eating and Drinking**\n\nWait at least 30 minutes before drinking anything. Start with small sips of water first, then gradually move on to small amounts of solid foods. You may feel bloated from the air pumped into your stomach, so be prepared for some burping and gas.\n\n**The Rest of the Day**\n\nTake it easy! Don't plan to return to work for the rest of the day, as it's not safe to drive or handle tools/equipment. Also, avoid making important decisions, even if you feel clear-headed. Keep an eye on the site where your IV was inserted and watch for any redness or swelling.\n\n**When to Call Your Doctor**\n\nContact your healthcare provider if you experience:\n\n* Black, tarry stools\n* Red blood in your stool\n* Vomiting that won't stop or vomiting blood\n* Severe pain or cramps in your belly\n* Chest pain\n* Blood in your stool for more than 2 bowel movements\n* Chills or fever over 101°F (38.3°C)\n* No bowel movement for more than 2 days\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy - discharge; Upper endoscopy - discharge; Gastroscopy - discharge\n\n---\n\n**EGD Discharge: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 2/3)**\n\nYou received medicine into a vein (IV).\nThe scope was inserted through your mouth into the esophagus (food pipe) to the stomach and first part of the small intestine (duodenum).

An antibody is a protein produced by the body's immune system when it detects foreign or potentially harmful substances, called antigens.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed. Most of the time, blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. The sample is sent to a laboratory where the targeted antibody or antigen is linked to a specific enzyme. If the target substance is in the sample, the test solution turns a different color.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is needed.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise.

Fever\n* D. Trouble sleeping\n* E. All of the above\n\nThe correct answer is all of the above. Ear infections can be painful. The most common type of ear infection is called otitis media. It occurs when the tubes that drain fluid from the middle ear into the throat become blocked, causing fluid to build up. This can lead to infection.\n\n\\n\\nChances are your child will have an ear infection.\n\nA. Myth\nB. Fact\n\nThe correct answer is fact. Ear infections are the most common reason parents bring their child to a doctor. Three out of four children will have at least one ear infection by their third birthday.\n\n\\n\\nDoctors use a special instrument to check for an ear infection.\n\nA. Myth\nB. Fact\n\nThe correct answer is fact. Health care providers use an instrument with a light called an otoscope to look inside the ear canal. They gently place the tip of the otoscope into the ear and move the instrument around. Then they check for red areas, fluid behind the eardrum, and other signs of infection.\n\n\\n\\nThis can help ease the pain from an ear infection:\n\nA. Applying a warm cloth or warm water bottle to the ear\nB. Using over-the-counter pain relief drops for ears or prescription ear drops\nC. Taking over-the-counter medications for pain or fever, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen\nD. All of the above\n\nThe correct answer is all of the above. Often, treating the pain and allowing the body time to heal itself is all that is needed for an ear infection. However, all children younger than 6 months with a fever or other symptoms should see the doctor. Never give aspirin to children.\n\n\\n\\nEar infections are more common in children because kids don’t clean their ears.\n\nA. Myth\nB. Fact\n\nThe correct answer is myth. Fluid does not drain out of the ear as easily as in adults. When the ears and throat become swollen from colds or allergies, germs can be trapped inside and cause an ear infection.\n\n\\n\\nWhen an ear infection doesn’t go away on its own, your child may need:\n\nA. Cough syrup\nB. Antibiotics\nC. Bandages\n\nThe correct answer is antibiotics. Some ear infections clear up on their own. If your child’s doctor prescribes antibiotics, make sure your child takes them as directed and finishes all the medicine. If the antibiotics don’t seem to be working within 48 to 72 hours, contact your doctor. You may need a different antibiotic.\n\n\\n\\nDoctors may recommend that a child have ear tube surgery if:\n\nA. The infection does not go away with the usual medical treatment\nB. The child has many ear infections over a short period of time\nC. Both A and B\n\nThe correct answer is both A and B. Ear tube surgery involves inserting a tiny tube into the child’s eardrum while the child is asleep and pain-free. This tube keeps open a small hole that allows air to get in so fluids can drain more easily. The ear tubes fall out by themselves, often within 6 - 9 months.\n\n---\n\n**Ear Infection Myths & Facts Quiz**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Ear Tube Surgery**\n\nEar tube surgery involves inserting a tiny tube into the child's eardrum while the child is asleep and pain-free. This tube keeps open a small hole that allows air to get in so fluids can drain more easily. The ear tubes fall out by themselves, often within 6 - 9 months.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Ear Infections and Hearing Loss**\n\nMost children have minor, short-term hearing loss during and right after an ear infection. This is due to fluid remaining in the ear. Any fluid left in the ear should go away within 3 - 6 weeks. Always check with your doctor if you have questions or concerns.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Call Your Child's Doctor**\n\nCall your child's doctor if you notice the following:\n\n*   Your child has a high fever or severe pain\n*   Pain, fever, or acting ill that does not get better within 24 to 48 hours\n*   Symptoms that get worse\n*   New symptoms such as severe headache, dizziness, swelling around the ear, or twitching of the face muscles\n*   All of the above\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Reducing the Risk of Ear Infections**\n\nWhile breast-feeding, babies are less likely to get ear infections. Other ways to lower your children's risk: Make sure both you and they wash their hands often, that they are up-to-date on their immunizations, and that they are never around secondhand smoke.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   Ear Infections\n*   Ear infection - acute",

The middle ear is a small space behind the eardrum that contains the ossicles, which are the smallest bones in the human body.\n*   **Causes and Risk Factors:** Middle ear infections occur when bacteria or viruses infect the middle ear. This can happen when there is an accumulation of fluid in the ear, such as during a cold or flu. Other risk factors include exposure to secondhand smoke, having a family history of ear infections, and being around people with ear infections.\n*   **Symptoms:** The symptoms of middle ear infection can vary depending on the age of the person affected. In children, common symptoms include fever, irritability, and pulling on the ear. In adults, symptoms may include hearing loss, fullness or pressure in the affected ear, and vertigo.\n*   **Diagnosis:** Diagnosis is typically made based on a physical examination and medical history. A healthcare provider may use a pneumatic otoscope to check for signs of middle ear infection, such as a red eardrum or fluid behind the eardrum.\n*   **Treatment Options:**\n    *   **Antibiotics:** For bacterial infections, antibiotics are usually prescribed to help clear up the infection.\n    *   **Pain Relief:** Over-the-counter pain medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help alleviate discomfort and reduce fever.\n    *   **Tympanocentesis:** In some cases, a healthcare provider may perform a tympanocentesis, which involves inserting a needle into the eardrum to drain fluid and relieve pressure.\n    *   **Watchful Waiting:** For viral infections or mild bacterial infections, watchful waiting may be recommended, with close monitoring of symptoms and follow-up appointments as needed.\n\n**Health Information Translations**\n\n*   **Middle Ear Infection in Children - Japanese (Japanese) Bilingual PDF**\n*   **Middle Ear Infection in Children - Korean (Korean) Bilingual PDF**\n*   **Middle Ear Infection in Children - Nepali (Nepali) Bilingual PDF**\n*   **Middle Ear Infection in Children - Russian (Russian) Bilingual PDF**\n*   **Middle Ear Infection in Children - Somali (Somali) Bilingual PDF**\n*   **Ear Infections: MedlinePlus Health Topic - English**\n*   **Infecciones de los oídos: Tema de salud de MedlinePlus - español (Spanish)**",

It's a common condition that can affect people of all ages, but it's most prevalent in children.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of Ear Infections**\n\nThere are two main types of ear infections:\n\n*   **Acute Otitis Media**: This is a sudden onset of symptoms, such as fever, headache, and ear pain.\n*   **Chronic Otitis Media**: This is a long-standing infection that can cause persistent symptoms.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Ear Infections**\n\nEar infections are usually caused by bacterial or viral infections. Some common causes include:\n\n*   **Eustachian Tube Dysfunction**: The Eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the back of the throat and helps regulate air pressure in the ear.\n*   **Respiratory Tract Infections**: Respiratory tract infections, such as a cold or flu, can spread to the ears and cause an infection.\n*   **Earwax Buildup**: Excessive earwax can block the ear canal and create a conducive environment for bacterial growth.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Ear Infections**\n\nThe symptoms of ear infections can vary depending on the severity and type of infection. Some common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Ear Pain**: A sharp, stabbing pain in the affected ear.\n*   **Fever**: A high temperature, usually above 102°F (39°C).\n*   **Headache**: A headache or feeling of pressure in the head.\n*   **Discharge**: Yellow or greenish discharge from the ear.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment of Ear Infections**\n\nThe treatment of ear infections depends on the severity and type of infection. Some common treatments include:\n\n*   **Antibiotics**: Oral antibiotics are usually prescribed to treat bacterial ear infections.\n*   **Pain Relief**: Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, can help alleviate ear pain.\n*   **Ear Drops**: Ear drops containing antibiotics or steroids can be used to treat ear infections.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention of Ear Infections**\n\nSome common ways to prevent ear infections include:\n\n*   **Good Hygiene**: Practicing good hygiene, such as washing hands regularly, can help prevent the spread of respiratory tract infections.\n*   **Earwax Removal**: Regularly removing excess earwax can help prevent blockages in the ear canal.\n*   **Vaccinations**: Getting vaccinated against certain bacterial and viral infections can help prevent ear infections.",

    "content": "**Ear Barotrauma**\n\nEar barotrauma causes discomfort in the ear due to pressure differences between the inside and outside of the eardrum. It may include damage to the ear.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe air pressure in the middle ear is most often the same as the air pressure outside of the body. The eustachian tube is a connection between the middle ear and the back of the nose and upper throat.\n\nSwallowing or yawning opens the eustachian tube and allows air to flow into or out of the middle ear. This helps equalize pressure on either side of the ear drum. If the eustachian tube is blocked, the air pressure in the middle ear is different than the pressure on the outside of the eardrum. This can cause barotrauma.\n\nMany people have barotrauma at some time. The problem often occurs with altitude changes, such as flying, scuba diving, or driving in the mountains. If you have a congested nose from allergies, colds, or an upper respiratory infection, you are more likely to develop barotrauma.\n\nBlockage of the eustachian tube could also be present before birth (congenital). It may also be caused by swelling in the throat.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Dizziness\n* Ear discomfort or pain in one or both ears\n* Hearing loss (slight)\n* Sensation of fullness or stuffiness in the ears\n\nOther symptoms may develop if the condition is very bad or goes on for a long time, such as:\n\n* Ear pain\n* Feeling of pressure in the ears (as if underwater)\n* Moderate to severe hearing loss\n* Nosebleed\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nDuring an exam of the ear, the health care provider may see a slight outward bulge or inward pull of the eardrum. If the condition is severe, there may be blood or bruising behind the eardrum.\n\nSevere barotrauma may cause the eardrum to look similar to an ear infection.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTo relieve ear pain or discomfort, you can take steps to open the eustachian tube and relieve the pressure, such as:\n\n* Chew gum\n* Inhale, and then gently exhale while holding the nostrils closed and the mouth shut\n* Suck on candy\n* Yawn\n\nWhen flying, DO NOT sleep as the plane prepares to land. Repeat the listed steps to open the eustachian tube. For infants and small children, nursing or taking sips of a drink may help.\n\nScuba divers should go down and come up slowly. Diving while you have congestion from allergies or a respiratory infection is dangerous. Barotrauma may be severe in these situations.\n\nIf self-care steps do not ease discomfort within a few hours or the problem is severe, you may need to see a provider.\n\nYou may need medicine to relieve nasal congestion and allow the eustachian tube to open. These include:\n\n* Decongestants taken by mouth, or by a nose spray\n* Steroids taken by mouth, or by a nose spray\n\nYou may need antibiotics to prevent or treat an ear infection if barotrauma is severe.\n\nRarely, surgery may be needed if other treatments do not work to open the tube. In this procedure, a surgical cut is made in the eardrum to allow pressure to become equal and fluid to drain (myringotomy).\n\n---\n\n**Ear Barotrauma**\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe air pressure in the middle ear is most often the same as the air pressure outside of the body.

    "content": "**Ear Emergencies**\n\nAn ear emergency is a serious condition that requires immediate attention. It can be caused by objects in the ear canal, ruptured eardrums, sudden hearing loss, and severe infections.\n\n**Considerations**\n\n*   Children often put objects into their ears, which can be hard to remove.\n*   The deep portion of the ear canal is a tube of solid bone lined with thin, sensitive skin. Any object pressing against this skin can cause severe pain.\n\n**Causes**\n\nPain, hearing loss, dizziness, ringing in the ear, and ruptured eardrums can be caused by:\n\n*   Inserting cotton swabs, toothpicks, pins, pens, or other objects into the ear\n*   Sudden changes in pressure, such as from an explosion, blow to the head, flying, scuba diving, falling while water skiing, or being slapped on the head or ear\n*   Loud sounds, such as a gun firing\n*   Inflammation of the inner or middle ear\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms include:\n\n*   Bleeding from the ear\n*   Bruising or redness\n*   Clear liquid coming out of the ear (brain fluid also called cerebrospinal fluid)\n*   Dizziness\n*   Earache\n*   Loss of hearing\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Noises in the ear\n*   Sensations of an object in the ear\n*   Swelling\n*   Visible object in the ear\n*   Fever\n*   Hearing loss\n\n**First Aid**\n\nDepending on the type of ear emergency, follow these steps:\n\n### Object in the Ear\n\nCalm and reassure the person.\n\nIf the object is sticking out and is easy to remove, gently remove it by hand or with tweezers. Then, get medical help to make sure the entire object has been removed.\n\nIf you think a small object may be lodged inside the ear, but you cannot see it, DO NOT reach inside the ear canal with tweezers. You can do more harm than good.\n\nTry using gravity to get the object out by tilting the head to the affected side. DO NOT strike the person's head. Shake it gently in the direction of the ground to try to dislodge the object.\n\nIf the object does not come out, get medical help.\n\n### Insect in the Ear\n\nDO NOT let the person put a finger in the ear. This may make the insect sting.\n\nTurn the person's head so that the affected side is up and wait to see if the insect flies or crawls out.\n\nIf this does not work, try pouring mineral oil, olive oil, or baby oil into the ear. For an adult, pull the ear lobe gently backward and upward as you pour the oil. For a child, pull the ear lobe backward and downward as you pour. The insect should suffocate and may float out in the oil.\n\nEven if an insect appears to come out, get medical attention. Small insect parts can irritate the sensitive skin of the ear canal.\n\n### Ruptured Eardrum\n\nThe person will have severe pain.\n\nPlace sterile cotton gently in the outer ear canal to keep the inside of the ear clean.\n\nGet medical help.\n\nDo not put any liquid into the ear.\n\n### Cuts on the Outer Ear\n\nApply direct pressure until the bleeding stops.\n\nCover the injury with a sterile dressing shaped to the contour of the ear, and tape it loosely in place.\n\nApply cold compresses over the dressing to reduce pain and swelling.\n\nIf part of the ear has been cut off, keep the part. Get medical help right away.\n\nPlace the part in a clean cloth and keep it on ice.\n\n### Drainage from Inside the Ear\n\nCover the outside of the ear with a sterile dressing shaped to the contour of the ear, and tape it loosely in place.\n\nHave the person lie down on the side with the affected ear down so that it can drain. However, DO NOT move the person if a neck or back injury is suspected.\n\nGet medical help right away.\n\nDO NOT\n\n*   Block any drainage coming from the ear.\n*   Try to clean or wash the inside of the ear canal.\n*   Put any liquid into the ear.\n*   Attempt to remove the object by probing with a cotton swab, a pin, or any other tool. To do so will risk pushing the object farther into the ear and damaging the middle ear.\n*   Reach inside the ear canal with tweezers.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nSome symptoms may mean you have had serious injury to your ear. See a provider if you have:\n\n*   Pain in the ear\n*   Ringing sounds\n*   Dizziness (vertigo)\n*   Hearing loss\n*   Drainage or blood from the ear\n*   Recent blow to your ear or head\n\n**Prevention**\n\nFollow these steps to prevent ear emergencies:\n\n*   Never put anything in the ear canal without first talking to a provider.\n*   Never hit the head to try to correct an ear problem.\n*   Teach children not to put things in their ears.\n*   Avoid cleaning the ear canals altogether.\n*   After an ear injury, avoid nose blowing and getting water in the injured ear.\n*   Treat ear infections right away.\n\nIf you tend to feel pain and pressure in your ears when flying:\n\n*   Drink a lot of fluid before and during the flight.\n*   Avoid the use of alcohol, caffeine, or tobacco on the day of the flight.\n*   Chew gum, suck on hard candy, or yawn during take-off and landing.\n*   Talk to your provider about taking a decongestant or using a nasal spray before you fly.\n\n---\n\n**Ear Emergencies**\n\nAn ear emergency is a serious condition that requires immediate attention from a healthcare professional. Some common causes of ear emergencies include objects in the ear canal, ruptured eardrums, sudden hearing loss, and severe infections.\n\n**Causes**\n\nPain, hearing loss, dizziness, ringing in the ear, and ruptured eardrums can be caused by:\n\n* Inserting cotton swabs, toothpicks, pins, pens, or other objects into the ear\n* Sudden changes in pressure, as from an explosion, blow to the head, flying, scuba diving, falling while water skiing, or being slapped on the head or ear\n* Loud sounds, such as a gun firing\n* Inflammation of the inner or middle ear\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms include:\n\n* Bleeding from the ear\n* Bruising or redness\n* Clear liquid coming out of the ear (brain fluid also called cerebrospinal fluid)\n* Dizziness\n* Earache\n* Loss of hearing\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Noises in the ear\n* Sensations of an object in the ear\n* Swelling\n* Visible object in the ear\n* Fever\n* Hearing loss\n\n**First Aid**\n\nDepending on the type of ear emergency, follow these steps:\n\n* **Object in the Ear**: Calm and reassure the person. If the object is sticking out and is easy to remove, gently remove it by hand or with tweezers. Then, get medical help to make sure the entire object has been removed.\n* **Insect in the Ear**: DO NOT let the person put a finger in the ear. This may make the insect sting. Turn the person's head so that the affected side is up and wait to see if the insect flies or crawls out. If this does not work, try pouring mineral oil, olive oil, or baby oil into the ear.\n* **Ruptured Eardrum**: The person will have severe pain. Place sterile cotton gently in the outer ear canal to keep the inside of the ear clean. Get medical help. Do not put any liquid into the ear.\n* **Cuts on the Outer Ear**: Apply direct pressure until the bleeding stops. Cover the injury with a sterile dressing shaped to the contour of the ear, and tape it loosely in place. Apply cold compresses over the dressing to reduce pain and swelling.\n* **Drainage from Inside the Ear**: Cover the outside of the ear with a sterile dressing shaped to the contour of the ear, and tape it loosely in place. Have the person lie down on the side with the affected ear down so that it can drain.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nSome symptoms may mean you have had serious injury to your ear. See a provider if you have:\n\n* Pain in the ear\n* Ringing sounds\n* Dizziness (vertigo)\n* Hearing loss\n* Drainage or blood from the ear\n* Recent blow to your ear or head\n\n**Prevention**\n\nFollow these steps to prevent ear emergencies:\n\n* Never put anything in the ear canal without first talking to a provider.\n* Never hit the head to try to correct an ear problem.\n* Teach children not to put things in their ears.\n* Avoid cleaning the ear canals altogether.\n* After an ear injury, avoid nose blowing and getting water in the injured ear.\n\n**References**\n\nGoodloe JM, Soulek J.

    "content": "**Ear Examination**\n\nAn ear exam is performed when a healthcare provider looks inside your ear using an instrument called an otoscope.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThe provider may dim the lights in the room. A young child will be asked to lie on their back with the head turned to the side, or the child's head may rest against an adult's chest. Older children and adults may sit with the head tilted toward the shoulder opposite the ear being examined.\n\nThe provider will gently pull up, back, or forward on the ear to straighten the ear canal. Then, the tip of the otoscope will be placed gently into your ear. A light beam shines through the otoscope into the ear canal. The provider will carefully move the scope in different directions to see the inside of the ear and eardrum.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo preparation is needed for this test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nIf there is an ear infection, there may be some discomfort or pain. The provider will stop the test if the pain worsens.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nAn ear exam may be done if you have an earache, ear infection, hearing loss, or other ear symptoms. Examining the ear also helps the provider see if treatment for an ear problem is working.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe ear canal differs in size, shape, and color from person to person. Normally, the canal is skin-colored and has small hairs. Yellowish-brown earwax may be present. The eardrum is a light-gray color or a shiny pearly-white. Light should reflect off the eardrum surface.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nEar infections are a common problem, especially with small children. A dull or absent light reflex from the eardrum may be a sign of a middle ear infection or fluid. The eardrum may be red and bulging if there is an infection. Amber liquid or bubbles behind the eardrum are often seen if fluid collects in the middle ear.\n\nAbnormal results may also be due to an external ear infection. You might feel pain when the outer ear is pulled or wiggled. The ear canal may be red, tender, swollen, or filled with yellowish-green pus.\n\nThe test may also be done for the following conditions:\n\n* Cholesteatoma\n* External ear infection - chronic\n* Head injury\n* Ruptured or perforated eardrum\n\n**Risks**\n\nAn infection can be spread from one ear to the other if the instrument used to look inside the ear has not been cleaned well.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nNot all ear problems can be detected by looking through an otoscope. Other ear and hearing tests may be needed. Otoscopes sold for at-home use are lower quality than the ones used at the provider's office. Parents may not be able to recognize some of the subtle signs of an ear problem.

    "content": "**Ear Infection - Acute**\n\n**What is an Ear Infection?**\n\nAn ear infection, also known as otitis media, is a common condition that affects children and adults alike. It occurs when there is swelling and infection in the middle ear, which is located just behind the eardrum.\n\n**Causes of Ear Infections**\n\nThe eustachian tube runs from the middle ear to the back of the throat. Normally, this tube drains fluid that is made in the middle ear. If this tube gets blocked, fluid can build up, leading to infection. Some causes of ear infections include:\n\n*   Allergies\n*   Colds and sinus infections\n*   Excess mucus and saliva produced during teething\n*   Infected or overgrown adenoids (lymph tissue in the upper part of the throat)\n*   Tobacco smoke\n\n**Risk Factors for Ear Infections**\n\nOther risk factors for acute ear infections include:\n\n*   Attending day care (especially centers with more than 6 children)\n*   Changes in altitude or climate\n*   Cold climate\n*   Exposure to smoke\n*   Family history of ear infections\n*   Not being breastfed\n*   Pacifier use\n*   Recent ear infection\n*   Recent illness of any type (because illness lowers the body's resistance to infection)\n*   Birth defect, leading to deficiency in eustachian tube function\n\n**Symptoms of Ear Infections**\n\nIn infants, often the main sign of an ear infection is acting irritable or crying that cannot be soothed. Many infants and children with an acute ear infection have a fever or trouble sleeping. Tugging on the ear is not always a sign that the child has an ear infection.\n\nSymptoms of an acute ear infection in older children or adults include:\n\n*   Ear pain\n*   Fullness in the ear\n*   Feeling of general illness\n*   Nasal congestion\n*   Cough\n*   Lethargy\n*   Vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Hearing loss in the affected ear\n*   Drainage of fluid from the ear\n*   Loss of appetite\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour provider will take your medical history and ask about symptoms.\n\nYour provider will look inside the ears using an instrument called an otoscope. This exam may show:\n\n*   Areas of marked redness\n*   Bulging of the tympanic membrane (eardrum)\n*   Discharge from the ear\n*   Air bubbles or fluid behind the eardrum\n*   A hole (perforation) in the eardrum\n\nYour provider might recommend a hearing test if you or your child has a history of ear infections.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSome ear infections clear on their own without antibiotics. Treating the pain and allowing the body time to heal itself is often all that is needed:\n\n*   Apply a warm cloth or warm water bottle to the affected ear.\n*   Use over-the-counter pain relief drops for ears. Or, ask your provider about prescription eardrops to relieve pain.\n*   Take over-the-counter medicines such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain or fever. Do not give aspirin to children.\n\nAll children younger than 6 months with a fever or symptoms of an ear infection should see their provider. Children who are older than 6 months may be watched at home if they do not have:\n\n*   A fever higher than 102°F (38.9°C)\n*   More severe pain or other symptoms\n*   Other medical problems\n\nIf there is no improvement or if symptoms get worse, schedule an appointment with your provider to determine whether antibiotics are needed.\n\n**Antibiotics**\n\nA virus or bacteria can cause ear infections. Antibiotics will not help an infection that is caused by a virus. Most providers don't prescribe antibiotics for every ear infection. However, all children younger than 6 months with an ear infection are treated with antibiotics.\n\nYour provider is more likely to prescribe antibiotics if your child:\n\n*   Is under age 2 years\n*   Has a fever\n*   Appears sick\n*   Does not improve in 24 to 48 hours\n\nIf antibiotics are prescribed, it is important to take them as directed and to take all of the medicines. Do not stop the medicine when symptoms go away. If the antibiotics do not seem to be working within 48 to 72 hours, contact your provider. You may need to switch to a different antibiotic.\n\nSide effects of antibiotics may include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Serious allergic reactions are rare, but may also occur.\n\nSome children have repeat ear infections that seem to go away between episodes. They may receive a smaller, daily dose of antibiotics to prevent new infections.\n\n**Surgery**\n\nIf an infection does not go away with the usual medical treatment, or if a child has many ear infections over a short period of time, their provider may recommend ear tubes:\n\n*   If a child more than 6 months old has had 3 or more ear infections within 6 months or more than 4 ear infections within a 12-month period\n*   If a child less than 6 months old has had 2 ear infections in a 6- to 12-month period or 3 episodes in 24 months\n*   If the infection does not go away with medical treatment\n\nIn this procedure, a tiny tube is inserted into the eardrum, keeping open a small hole that allows air to get in so fluids can drain more easily (myringotomy).\n\nThe tubes often eventually fall out by themselves. Those that don't fall out may be removed in your provider's office.\n\nIf the adenoids are enlarged, removing them with surgery may be considered if ear infections continue to occur. Removing tonsils does not seem to help prevent ear infections.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost often, an ear infection is a minor problem that gets better. Ear infections can be treated, but they may occur again in the future.\n\nMost children will have slight short-term hearing loss during and right after an ear infection. This is due to fluid in the ear. Fluid can stay behind the eardrum for weeks or even months after the infection has cleared.\n\nSpeech or language delay is uncommon. It may occur in a child who has lasting hearing loss from many repeated ear infections.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nIn rare cases, a more serious infection may develop, such as:\n\n*   Tearing of the eardrum\n*   Spreading of infection to nearby tissues, such as infection of the bones behind the ear (mastoiditis) or infection of the brain membrane (meningitis)\n*   Chronic otitis media\n*   Collection of pus in or around the brain (abscess)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n*   You have swelling behind the ear.\n*   Your symptoms get worse, even with treatment.\n*   You have a high fever or severe pain.\n*   Severe pain suddenly stops, which may indicate a ruptured eardrum.\n*   New symptoms appear, especially severe headache, dizziness, swelling around the ear, or twitching of the face muscles.\n\nLet your provider know right away if a child younger than 6 months has a fever, even if the child doesn't have other symptoms.\n\n---\n\n**Ear Infection - Acute**\n\nSuspected ear infections are one of the most common reasons parents take their children to their health care provider. The most common type of ear infection is called otitis media. It is caused by swelling and infection of the middle ear. The middle ear is located just behind the eardrum.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe eustachian tube runs from the middle of each ear to the back of the throat. Normally, this tube drains fluid that is made in the middle ear. If this tube gets blocked, fluid can build up. This can lead to infection.\n\nEar infections are common in infants and children because their eustachian tubes are easily clogged.\nEar infections can also occur in adults, although they are much less common than in children.\n\nAnything that causes the eustachian tubes to become swollen or blocked may lead to more fluid buildup in the middle ear behind the eardrum. Some causes are:\n\nAllergies\nColds and sinus infections\nExcess mucus and saliva produced during teething\nInfected or overgrown adenoids (lymph tissue in the upper part of the throat)\nTobacco smoke\n\nEar infections are also more likely in children who spend a lot of time drinking from a sippy cup or bottle while lying on their back. Milk may enter the eustachian tube, which may increase the risk of an ear infection. Getting water in the ears will not cause an acute ear infection unless the eardrum has a hole in it.\n\nOther risk factors for acute ear infections include:\n\nAttending day care (especially centers with more than 6 children)\nChanges in altitude or climate\nCold climate\nExposure to smoke\nFamily history of ear infections\nNot being breastfed\nPacifier use\nRecent ear infection\nRecent illness of any type (because illness lowers the body's resistance to infection)\nBirth defect, leading to deficiency in eustachian tube function\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIn infants, often the main sign of an ear infection is acting irritable or crying that cannot be soothed. Many infants and children with an acute ear infection have a fever or trouble sleeping. Tugging on the ear is not always a sign that the child has an ear infection.\n\nSymptoms of an acute ear infection in older children or adults include:\n\nEar pain\nFullness in the ear\nFeeling of general illness\nNasal congestion\nCough\nLethargy\nVomiting\nDiarrhea\nHearing loss in the affected ear\nDrainage of fluid from the ear\nLoss of appetite\n\nThe ear infection may start shortly after a cold. Sudden drainage of yellow or green fluid from the ear may mean the eardrum has ruptured.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour provider will take your medical history and ask about symptoms.\n\nYour provider will look inside the ears using an instrument called an otoscope. This exam may show:\n\nAreas of marked redness\nBulging of the tympanic membrane (eardrum)\nDischarge from the ear\nAir bubbles or fluid behind the eardrum\nA hole (perforation) in the eardrum\n\nYour provider might recommend a hearing test if you or your child has a history of ear infections.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSome ear infections clear on their own without antibiotics.

Some causes are:\n\n* Allergies\n* Colds and sinus infections\n* Excess mucus and saliva produced during teething\n* Infected or overgrown adenoids (lymph tissue in the upper part of the throat)\n* Tobacco smoke\n\nEar infections are also more likely in children who spend a lot of time drinking from a sippy cup or bottle while lying on their back. Milk may enter the eustachian tube, which may increase the risk of an ear infection. Getting water in the ears will not cause an acute ear infection unless the eardrum has a hole in it.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nOther risk factors for acute ear infections include:\n\n* Attending day care (especially centers with more than 6 children)\n* Changes in altitude or climate\n* Cold climate\n* Exposure to smoke\n* Family history of ear infections\n* Not being breastfed\n* Pacifier use\n* Recent ear infection\n* Recent illness of any type (because illness lowers the body's resistance to infection)\n* Birth defect, leading to deficiency in eustachian tube function\n\n---\n\n**Ear Infection - Acute**\n\n**What is an ear infection?**\n\nAn ear infection, also known as acute otitis media, is a bacterial or viral infection of the middle ear.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe eustachian tube runs from the middle of each ear to the back of the throat. Normally, this tube drains fluid that is made in the middle ear. If this tube gets blocked, fluid can build up. This can lead to infection.\n\nAnything that causes the eustachian tubes to become swollen or blocked may lead to more fluid buildup in the middle ear behind the eardrum. Some causes are:\n\n* Attending day care (especially centers with more than 6 children)\n* Changes in altitude or climate\n* Cold climate\n* Exposure to smoke\n* Family history of ear infections\n* Not being breastfed\n* Pacifier use\n* Recent ear infection\n* Recent illness of any type (because illness lowers the body's resistance to infection)\n* Birth defect, leading to deficiency in eustachian tube function\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nIn infants, often the main sign of an ear infection is acting irritable or crying that cannot be soothed. Many infants and children with an acute ear infection have a fever or trouble sleeping.\n\nSymptoms of an acute ear infection in older children or adults include:\n\n* Ear pain\n* Fullness in the ear\n* Feeling of general illness\n* Nasal congestion\n* Cough\n* Lethargy\n* Vomiting\n* Diarrhea\n* Hearing loss in the affected ear\n* Drainage of fluid from the ear\n* Loss of appetite\n\nThe ear infection may start shortly after a cold. Sudden drainage of yellow or green fluid from the ear may mean the eardrum has ruptured.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour provider will take your medical history and ask about symptoms.\n\nYour provider will look inside the ears using an instrument called an otoscope. This exam may show:\n\n* Areas of marked redness\n* Bulging of the tympanic membrane (eardrum)\n* Discharge from the ear\n* Air bubbles or fluid behind the eardrum\n* A hole (perforation) in the eardrum\n\nYour provider might recommend a hearing test if you or your child has a history of ear infections.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSome ear infections clear on their own without antibiotics. Treating the pain and allowing the body time to heal itself is often all that is needed:\n\n* Apply a warm cloth or warm water bottle to the affected ear.\n* Use over-the-counter pain relief drops for ears. Or, ask your provider about prescription eardrops to relieve pain.\n* Take over-the-counter medicines such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain or fever. Do not give aspirin to children.\n\nAll children younger than 6 months with a fever or symptoms of an ear infection should see their provider. Children who are older than 6 months may be watched at home if they do not have:\n\n* A fever higher than 102°F (38.9°C)\n* More severe pain or other symptoms\n* Other medical problems\n\nIf there is no improvement or if symptoms get worse, schedule an appointment with your provider to determine whether antibiotics are needed.\n\n**Antibiotics**\n\nA virus or bacteria can cause ear infections. Antibiotics will not help an infection that is caused by a virus. Most providers don't prescribe antibiotics for every ear infection. However, all children younger than 6 months with an ear infection are treated with antibiotics.\n\nYour provider is more likely to prescribe antibiotics if your child:\n\n* Is under age 2 years\n* Has a fever\n* Appears sick\n* Does not improve in 24 to 48 hours\n\nIf antibiotics are prescribed, it is important to take them as directed and to take all of the medicines. Do not stop the medicine when symptoms go away.\n\n**Surgery**\n\nIf an infection does not go away with the usual medical treatment, or if a child has many ear infections over a short period of time, their provider may recommend ear tubes:\n\n* If a child more than 6 months old has had 3 or more ear infections within 6 months or more than 4 ear infections within a 12-month period\n* If a child less than 6 months old has had 2 ear infections in a 6- to 12-month period or 3 episodes in 24 months\n* If the infection does not go away with medical treatment\n\nIn this procedure, a tiny tube is inserted into the eardrum, keeping open a small hole that allows air to get in so fluids can drain more easily (myringotomy).\n\nThe tubes often eventually fall out by themselves. Those that don't fall out may be removed in your provider's office.\n\n---\n\n**Ear Infection - Acute**\n\n\\n\\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nA hole that allows air to get in so fluids can drain more easily (myringotomy).\n\nThe tubes often eventually fall out by themselves.

Do not stop the medicine when symptoms go away. If the antibiotics do not seem to be working within 48 to 72 hours, contact your provider. You may need to switch to a different antibiotic.\n\nSide effects of antibiotics may include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Serious allergic reactions are rare, but may also occur.\n\nSome children have repeat ear infections that seem to go away between episodes. They may receive a smaller, daily dose of antibiotics to prevent new infections.\n\n\\n\\n**Surgery**\n\nIf an infection does not go away with the usual medical treatment, or if a child has many ear infections over a short period of time, their provider may recommend ear tubes:\n\n* If a child more than 6 months old has had 3 or more ear infections within 6 months or more than 4 ear infections within a 12-month period\n* If a child less than 6 months old has had 2 ear infections in a 6- to 12-month period or 3 episodes in 24 months\n* If the infection does not go away with medical treatment\n\nIn this procedure, a tiny tube is inserted into the eardrum, keeping open a small hole that allows air to get in so fluids can drain more easily (myringotomy).\n\nThe tubes often eventually fall out by themselves.

Removing tonsils does not seem to help prevent ear infections.\n\n\\n\\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost often, an ear infection is a minor problem that gets better. Ear infections can be treated, but they may occur again in the future.\n\nMost children will have slight short-term hearing loss during and right after an ear infection. This is due to fluid in the ear. Fluid can stay behind the eardrum for weeks or even months after the infection has cleared.\n\nSpeech or language delay is uncommon. It may occur in a child who has lasting hearing loss from many repeated ear infections.\n\n\\n\\n**Possible Complications**\n\nIn rare cases, a more serious infection may develop, such as:\n\n* Tearing of the eardrum\n* Spreading of infection to nearby tissues, such as infection of the bones behind the ear (mastoiditis) or infection of the brain membrane (meningitis)\n* Chronic otitis media\n* Collection of pus in or around the brain (abscess)\n\n\\n\\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* You have swelling behind the ear.\n* Your symptoms get worse, even with treatment.\n* You have a high fever or severe pain.\n* Severe pain suddenly stops, which may indicate a ruptured eardrum.\n* New symptoms appear, especially severe headache, dizziness, swelling around the ear, or twitching of the face muscles.\n\n---\n\n**Ear Infection - Acute**\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Severe pain suddenly stops, which may indicate a ruptured eardrum.\n* New symptoms appear, especially severe headache, dizziness, swelling around the ear, or twitching of the face muscles.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* You have swelling behind the ear.\n* Your symptoms get worse, even with treatment.\n* You have a high fever or severe pain.\n* Severe pain suddenly stops, which may indicate a ruptured eardrum.\n* New symptoms appear, especially severe headache, dizziness, swelling around the ear, or twitching of the face muscles.\n\n**Let your provider know right away if a child younger than 6 months has a fever, even if the child doesn't have other symptoms.**\n\n**Prevention**\n\nYou can reduce your child's risk of ear infections with the following measures:\n\n* Wash your hands and your child's hands and toys to decrease the chance of getting a cold.\n* If possible, choose a day care that has 6 or fewer children. This can reduce your child's chances of getting a cold or other infection.\n* Avoid using pacifiers.\n* Breastfeed your baby.\n* Avoid bottle feeding your child when they are lying down.\n* Avoid smoking.\n* Make sure your child's immunizations are up to date. The pneumococcal vaccine prevents infections from the bacteria that most commonly cause acute ear infections and many respiratory infections.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nOtitis media - acute; Infection - inner ear; Middle ear infection - acute\n\n**Images**\n\nEar anatomy\nMiddle ear infection (otitis media)\nOtoscopic exam of the ear\nEustachian tube\nMastoiditis - side view of head\nMastoiditis - redness and swelling behind ear\nEar tube insertion  - series\n\n**References**\n\nHaddad J.

    "content": "**Ear Infection - Chronic**\n\nChronic ear infection is a condition where there is fluid, swelling, or an infection behind the eardrum that does not go away or keeps coming back. It may cause long-term or permanent damage to the ear and involves a hole in the eardrum (perforation) that does not heal.\n\n**Causes**\n\nA chronic ear infection develops when fluid or an infection behind the eardrum does not go away. The eustachian tube runs from the middle of each ear to the back of the throat, draining fluid made in the middle ear. If this tube becomes blocked, fluid can build up, leading to infection.\n\nPossible causes include:\n\n*   An acute ear infection that does not completely go away\n*   Repeated ear infections\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of a chronic ear infection may be less severe than symptoms of an acute infection and may go unnoticed and untreated for a long time. They may include:\n\n*   Ear pain or discomfort that is usually mild and feels like pressure in the ear\n*   Fever, usually low-grade\n*   Fussiness in infants\n*   Pus-like drainage from the ear\n*   Hearing loss\n\nSymptoms may continue or come and go and may occur in one or both ears.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will look in the ears using an otoscope. The exam may reveal:\n\n*   Dullness, redness in the middle ear\n*   Air bubbles in the middle ear\n*   Thick fluid in the middle ear\n*   Eardrum that sticks to the bones in the middle ear\n*   Draining fluid from the eardrum\n*   A hole in the eardrum\n*   An eardrum that bulges out or pulls back inward (collapses)\n\nTests may include cultures of the ear fluid, a CT scan of the head or mastoids, and hearing tests.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYour provider may prescribe antibiotics if the infection is caused by bacteria. These medicines may need to be taken for a long time. They may be given by mouth or into a vein (intravenously).\n\nIf there is a hole in the eardrum, antibiotic ear drops are used. The provider may recommend using a mild acidic solution (such as vinegar and water) for a hard-to-treat infected ear that has a hole.\n\nA surgeon may need to clean out (debride) tissue that has gathered inside the ear. Other surgeries that may be needed include surgery to clean the infection out of the mastoid bone, repair or replace the small bones in the middle ear, repair of the eardrum, and ear tube surgery.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nChronic ear infections often respond to treatment. However, your child may need to keep taking medicines for several months.\n\nChronic ear infections are not life-threatening. However, they can be uncomfortable and may result in hearing loss and other serious complications.\n\nPossible complications include infection of the mastoid bone behind the ear (mastoiditis), ongoing drainage from a hole in the eardrum that does not heal, or after ear tubes are inserted, cyst in the middle ear (cholesteatoma), hardening of the tissue in the middle ear (tympanosclerosis), damage to, or wearing away of the bones of the middle ear, which help with hearing, paralysis of the face, inflammation around the brain (epidural abscess) or in the brain, and damage to the part of the ear that helps with balance.\n\nHearing loss from damage to the middle ear may slow language and speech development. This is more likely if both ears are affected.\n\nPermanent hearing loss is rare, but the risk increases with the number and length of infections.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n*   You or your child has signs of a chronic ear infection\n*   An ear infection does not respond to treatment\n*   New symptoms develop during or after treatment\n\n---\n\n**Ear Infection - Chronic**\n\nChronic ear infection is fluid, swelling, or an infection behind the eardrum that does not go away or keeps coming back.

It can be caused by bacteria or viruses and can lead to serious complications if left untreated.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of a chronic ear infection is not always clear, but it is thought to be related to:\n\n*   **Eustachian tube dysfunction**: The Eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the back of the throat and helps to regulate air pressure in the ear. If this tube becomes blocked or dysfunctional, it can lead to a buildup of fluid in the ear, creating an ideal environment for bacterial growth.\n*   **Weakened immune system**: People with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or taking immunosuppressive medications, are more susceptible to chronic ear infections.\n*   **Anatomical abnormalities**: Certain anatomical abnormalities, such as a cleft palate or a narrow Eustachian tube, can increase the risk of developing a chronic ear infection.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of a chronic ear infection can vary depending on the severity of the infection and the individual's overall health. Common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Ear pain**: A dull, aching pain in the affected ear that may worsen with movement or changes in temperature.\n*   **Fever**: A persistent fever is often present in cases of chronic ear infection.\n*   **Discharge**: Yellow or greenish discharge from the ear canal.\n*   **Hearing loss**: In severe cases, chronic ear infections can lead to permanent hearing loss.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for a chronic ear infection typically involves a combination of antibiotics and other medications to help manage symptoms and prevent complications. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to drain the infected fluid from the middle ear.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo reduce the risk of developing a chronic ear infection:\n\n*   **Get regular check-ups**: Regular follow-up exams with your healthcare provider can help identify any potential issues early on.\n*   **Practice good hygiene**: Keeping the ears clean and dry can help prevent bacterial growth.\n*   **Manage underlying conditions**: If you have an underlying condition that increases your risk of developing a chronic ear infection, such as a weakened immune system, be sure to manage it effectively.\n\nBy being aware of the causes, symptoms, and treatment options for chronic ear infections, you can take steps to reduce your risk of developing this serious condition.",

    "content": "**Ear Tag**\n\nAn ear tag is a small skin tag or pit in front of the outside part of the ear.\n\n**Considerations**\n\n* Skin tags and pits just in front of the opening of the ear are common in newborn infants.\n* In most cases, these are normal. However, they can be associated with other medical conditions.\n* It is important to point out skin tags or pits to your child's health care provider during the routine well-child exam.\n\n**Causes**\n\nSome causes of an ear tag or pit are:\n\n* An inherited tendency to have this facial feature\n* A genetic syndrome that includes having these pits or tags\n* A sinus tract problem (an abnormal connection between the skin and tissue underneath)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nYour provider will most often find the skin tag during your first well-baby visit. However, contact your provider if your child has bleeding, swelling, or discharge at the site.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will get a medical history and will do a physical exam.\n\n* Medical history questions about this condition might include:\n\t+ What exactly is the problem (skin tag, pit, or other)?\n\t+ Are both ears affected or only one?\n\t+ What other symptoms are present?\n\t+ Does the child respond normally to sounds?\n* It is now standard of care to have a hearing screen in the newborn nursery. An abnormal screen with the presence of an ear pit or tag should lead to a follow-up hearing screen with an audiologist.\n* Babies that are born at birthing centers without hearing screening or at home should have hearing tests completed to check their hearing especially if there is an ear tag or ear pit present.\n\n**Physical Exam**\n\nYour baby will be examined for other signs of disorders that are sometimes associated with ear tags or pits. A hearing test may be done if the child did not have the usual newborn screening test.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nPreauricular tag; Preauricular pit\n\n**References**\n\nBalest AL, Riley MM, O'Donnell B, Zarit JS.

It's usually harmless and doesn't require treatment.\n\n**Causes of an Ear Tag**\n\nSome causes of an ear tag or pit are:\n\n*   A sinus tract problem (an abnormal connection between the skin and tissue underneath)\n*   When to Contact a Medical Professional\n\nYour provider will most often find the skin tag during your first well-baby visit. However, contact your provider if your child has bleeding, swelling, or discharge at the site.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will get a medical history and will do a physical exam.\n\nMedical history questions about this condition might include:\n\n*   What exactly is the problem (skin tag, pit, or other)?\n*   Are both ears affected or only one?\n*   What other symptoms are present?\n*   Does the child respond normally to sounds?\n\nIt is now standard of care to have a hearing screen in the newborn nursery. An abnormal screen with the presence of an ear pit or tag should lead to a follow-up hearing screen with an audiologist.\n\nBabies that are born at birthing centers without hearing screening or at home should have hearing tests completed to check their hearing especially if there is an ear tag or ear pit present.\n\nPhysical exam:\n\nYour baby will be examined for other signs of disorders that are sometimes associated with ear tags or pits. A hearing test may be done if the child did not have the usual newborn screening test.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nPreauricular tag; Preauricular pit\n\n**Images**\n\nNewborn ear anatomy",

A hearing test is also recommended before the procedure is done.\n\nAlways tell your child's provider:\n\n* What medicines your child is taking, including medicines, herbs, and vitamins you bought without a prescription.\n* What allergies your child may have to any medicines, latex, tape, or skin cleaner.\n\nOn the day of the surgery:\n\n* Your child may be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before the surgery.\n* Give your child a small sip of water with any medicines you have been told to give your child.\n* Your child's provider will tell you when to arrive at the hospital.\n* The provider will make sure your child is healthy enough for surgery. This means your child has no signs of illness or infection. If your child is ill, the surgery may be delayed.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nChildren most often stay in the recovery room for a short time and leave the hospital the same day as the ear tubes are inserted. Your child may be groggy and fussy for an hour or so while waking up from anesthesia. Your child's provider may prescribe ear drops or antibiotics for a few days after the surgery. Your child's provider may also ask that you keep the ears dry for a specific period of time.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAfter this procedure, most parents report that their children:\n\n* Have fewer ear infections\n* Recover more quickly from infections\n* Have better hearing\n\nIf the tubes do not fall out on their own in a few years, an ear specialist may have to remove them. If ear infections return after the tubes fall out, another set of ear tubes can be inserted.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nMyringotomy; Tympanostomy; Ear tube surgery; Pressure equalization tubes; Ventilating tubes; Otitis - tubes; Ear infection - tubes; Otitis media - tubes\n\n---\n\n**Ear Tube Insertion**\n\n\\n\\n**What is ear tube insertion?**\n\nEar tube insertion, also known as tympanostomy tubes, is a surgical procedure used to treat recurring or chronic middle ear infections in children. The procedure involves placing small tubes in the eardrum to drain fluid and equalize air pressure.\n\n\\n\\n**How does it work?**\n\nThe ear tube allows air to enter the middle ear, helping to reduce fluid buildup and prevent further infections. The procedure is usually performed under general anesthesia and takes about 30 minutes to an hour to complete.\n\n\\n\\n**Who needs ear tube insertion?**\n\nEar tube insertion is typically recommended for children who have had multiple episodes of middle ear infections or have a persistent infection that has not responded to other treatments.\n\n\\n\\n**What are the benefits of ear tube insertion?**\n\nThe benefits of ear tube insertion include:\n\n*   Reduced risk of further middle ear infections\n*   Improved hearing and communication\n*   Relief from symptoms such as ear pain, fever, and irritability\n\n\\n\\n**Are there any risks or complications associated with ear tube insertion?**\n\nAs with any surgical procedure, there are potential risks and complications associated with ear tube insertion, including:\n\n*   Bleeding or infection at the incision site\n*   Damage to the eardrum or surrounding tissue\n*   Adverse reactions to anesthesia\n\n\\n\\n**How can I prepare my child for ear tube insertion?**\n\nBefore the procedure, it's essential to discuss any concerns or questions you have with your child's healthcare provider. You should also ensure that your child is healthy enough for surgery and follows any pre-operative instructions provided by their doctor.\n\n\\n\\n**What happens after ear tube insertion?**\n\nAfter the procedure, your child will need to rest for a few hours to allow the anesthesia to wear off. They may experience some discomfort or pain, which can be managed with over-the-counter pain medication. Follow-up appointments with your child's healthcare provider are crucial to monitor their recovery and remove the ear tubes when necessary.\n\n\\n\\n**How long do ear tubes stay in place?**\n\nEar tubes typically remain in place for 6-18 months before they fall out on their own. In some cases, the doctor may need to remove them surgically if they become stuck or cause problems.\n\n\\n\\n**Can ear tube insertion be performed at home?**\n\nNo, ear tube insertion is a surgical procedure that should only be performed by a qualified healthcare professional in a sterile environment.",

    "content": "**Earache**\n\nAn earache is a sharp, dull, or burning pain in one or both ears. The pain may last a short time or be ongoing.\n\n**Related Conditions**\n\n* Otitis media\n* Swimmer's ear\n* Malignant otitis externa\n\n**Considerations**\n\nThe symptoms of an ear infection may include:\n\n* Ear pain\n* Fever\n* Fussiness\n* Increased crying\n* Irritability\n\nMany children will have minor hearing loss during or right after an ear infection. Most of the time, the problem goes away. Lasting hearing loss is rare, but the risk increases with the number of infections.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe eustachian tube runs from the middle part of each ear to the back of the throat. This tube drains fluid that is made in the middle ear. If the eustachian tube becomes blocked, fluid can build up. This may lead to pressure behind the eardrum or an ear infection.\n\nEar pain in adults is less likely to be from an ear infection. Pain that you feel in the ear may be coming from another place, such as your teeth, the joint in your jaw (temporomandibular joint), or your throat. This is called referred pain.\n\nCauses of ear pain may include:\n\n* Arthritis of the jaw\n* Short-term (acute) ear infection\n* Long-term (chronic) ear infection\n* Ear injury from pressure changes (from high altitudes and other causes)\n* Object stuck in the ear or buildup of ear wax\n* Hole in the eardrum\n* Sinus infection\n* Sore throat\n* Temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ)\n* Tooth infection\n\nEar pain in a child or infant may be due to infection. Other causes may include:\n\n* Ear canal irritation from cotton-tipped swabs\n* Soap or shampoo staying in the ear\n\n**Home Care**\n\nThe following steps may help an earache:\n\n* Place a cold pack or cold wet washcloth on the outer ear for 20 minutes to reduce pain.\n* Chewing may help relieve the pain and pressure of an ear infection. (Gum can be a choking hazard for young children.)\n* Resting in an upright position instead of lying down can reduce pressure in the middle ear.\n* Over-the-counter ear drops can be used to relieve pain, as long as the eardrum has not ruptured.\n* Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, can provide relief for children and adults with an earache. (Do not give aspirin to children.)\n\nFor ear pain caused by a change of altitude, such as on an airplane:\n\n* Swallow or chew gum as the plane descends.\n* Allow infants to suck on a bottle or breastfeed.\n\nThe following steps can help prevent earaches:\n\n* Avoid smoking near children. Secondhand smoke is a major cause of ear infections in children.\n* Prevent outer ear infections by not putting objects in the ear.\n* Dry the ears well after bathing or swimming.\n* Take steps to control allergies. Try to avoid allergy triggers.\n* Try a steroid nasal spray to help reduce ear infections. (However, over-the-counter antihistamines and decongestants do not prevent ear infections.)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if:\n\n* Your child has a high fever, severe pain, or seems sicker than is usual for an ear infection.\n* Your child has new symptoms such as dizziness, headache, swelling around the ear, or weakness in the face muscles.\n* Severe pain suddenly stops (this may be a sign of a ruptured eardrum).\n* Symptoms (pain, fever, or irritability) get worse or do not improve within 24 to 48 hours.\n\n---\n\n**Earache: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 2/3)**\n\nAn earache is a sharp, dull, or burning pain in one or both ears.

Secondhand smoke is a major cause of ear infections in children.\n*   Prevent outer ear infections by not putting objects in the ear.\n*   Dry the ears well after bathing or swimming.\n*   Take steps to control allergies. Try to avoid allergy triggers.\n*   Try a steroid nasal spray to help reduce ear infections.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if:\n\n*   Your child has a high fever, severe pain, or seems sicker than is usual for an ear infection.\n*   Your child has new symptoms such as dizziness, headache, swelling around the ear, or weakness in the face muscles.\n*   Severe pain suddenly stops (this may be a sign of a ruptured eardrum).\n*   Symptoms (pain, fever, or irritability) get worse or do not improve within 24 to 48 hours.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nThe provider will do a physical exam and look at the ear, nose, and throat areas. Pain, tenderness, or redness of the mastoid bone behind the ear on the skull is often a sign of a serious infection.",

    "content": "**Eardrum Repair**\n\nEardrum repair refers to one or more surgical procedures that are done to correct a tear or other damage to the eardrum (tympanic membrane).\n\n**Ossiculoplasty**\n\nOssiculoplasty is the repair of the small bones in the middle ear.\n\n**Description**\n\nMost adults (and all children) receive general anesthesia for this surgery. This means you'll be asleep and unable to feel pain. Sometimes, local anesthesia is used along with medicine that makes you sleepy.\n\nYour surgeon will make a cut behind the ear or inside the ear canal.\n\nDepending on the problem, your surgeon will:\n\n* Clean out any infection or dead tissue on the eardrum or in the middle ear.\n* Patch the eardrum with a piece of the patient's own tissue taken from a vein or muscle sheath (called tympanoplasty). This procedure will usually take 2 to 3 hours.\n* Remove, replace, or repair 1 or more of the 3 little bones in the middle ear (called ossiculoplasty).\n* Repair smaller holes in the eardrum by placing either gel or a special paper over the eardrum (called myringoplasty). This procedure will usually take 10 to 30 minutes.\n\nYour surgeon will use an operating microscope to view and repair the eardrum or the small bones.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nThe eardrum is between the outer ear and the middle ear. It vibrates when sound waves strike it. When the eardrum is damaged or has a hole in it, hearing may be reduced and ear infections may be more likely.\n\nCauses of holes or openings in the eardrum include:\n\n* A bad ear infection\n* Dysfunction of the eustachian tube\n* Sticking something inside the ear canal\n* Surgery to place ear tubes\n* Trauma\n\nIf the eardrum has a small hole, myringoplasty may work to close it. Most of the time, your health care provider will wait at least 6 weeks after the hole developed before suggesting surgery.\n\nTympanoplasty may be done if:\n\n* The eardrum has a larger hole or opening\n* There is a chronic infection in the ear, and antibiotics do not help\n* There is a buildup of extra tissue around or behind the eardrum\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n* Reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots, infection\n\nRisks of this procedure include:\n\n* Damage to the facial nerve or nerve controlling the sense of taste\n* Damage to the small bones in the middle ear, causing hearing loss\n* Dizziness or vertigo\n* Incomplete healing of the hole in the eardrum\n* Worsening of hearing, or, in rare cases, complete loss of hearing\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nTell your surgeon:\n\n* What allergies you or your child may have to any medicines, latex, tape, or skin cleanser\n* What medicines you or your child is taking, including herbs and vitamins you bought without a prescription\n\n---\n\n**Eardrum Repair**\n\n**What is Eardrum Repair?**\n\nEardrum repair refers to one or more surgical procedures that are done to correct a tear or other damage to the eardrum (tympanic membrane).\n\n**Types of Eardrum Repair**\n\n* Ossiculoplasty: The repair of the small bones in the middle ear.\n* Myringoplasty: A procedure to repair smaller holes in the eardrum by placing either gel or a special paper over the eardrum.\n\n**Why is Eardrum Repair Performed?**\n\nThe eardrum is between the outer ear and the middle ear.

If this happens, your surgeon may perform an ossiculoplasty.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n* Reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots, infection\n\nRisks of this procedure include:\n\n* Damage to the facial nerve or nerve controlling the sense of taste\n* Damage to the small bones in the middle ear, causing hearing loss\n* Dizziness or vertigo\n* Incomplete healing of the hole in the eardrum\n* Worsening of hearing, or, in rare cases, complete loss of hearing\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nTell your surgeon:\n\n* What allergies you or your child may have to any medicines, latex, tape, or skin cleanser\n* What medicines you or your child is taking, including herbs and vitamins you bought without a prescription\n\nOn the day of the surgery for children:\n\n* Follow instructions about not eating or drinking. For infants, this includes breastfeeding.\n* Take any needed medicines with a small sip of water.\n* If you or your child is ill on the morning of surgery, call the surgeon right away. The procedure will need to be rescheduled.\n* Arrive at the hospital on time.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou or your child may leave the hospital the same day as the surgery, but may need to stay the night in case of any complications.\n\nTo protect the ear after surgery:\n\n* Packing will be placed in the ear for the first 5 to 7 days.\n* Sometimes a dressing covers the ear itself.\n* Until your provider says it is OK:\n\t+ Do not allow water to get into the ear. When showering or washing your hair, place cotton in the outer ear and cover it with petroleum jelly. An option to using cotton and petroleum jelly is to wear a shower cap pulled down to cover your ears.\n\t+ Do not \"pop\" your ears or blow your nose. If you need to sneeze, do so with your mouth. Draw any mucus in your nose back into your throat.\n\t+ Avoid air travel and swimming.\n\nGently wipe away any ear drainage on the outside of the ear. You may get eardrops the first week. Do not put anything else into the ear.\n\nIf you have stitches behind the ear and they get wet, gently dry the area. Do not rub.\n\nYou or your child may feel pulsing, or hear popping, clicking, or other sounds in the ear. The ear may feel full or as if it is filled with liquid. There may be sharp, shooting pains off and on soon after the surgery.\n\nTo avoid catching a cold, stay away from crowded places and people with cold symptoms.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nIn most cases, the pain and symptoms are completely relieved. Hearing loss is minor.\n\nThe outcome may not be as good if the bones in the middle ear need to be reconstructed, along with the eardrum.\n\n---\n\n**Eardrum Repair**\n\nThe eardrum is a thin membrane between the outer ear and the middle ear. It vibrates when sound waves strike it. When the eardrum is damaged or has a hole in it, hearing may be reduced and ear infections may be more likely.\n\n**Causes of Holes or Openings in the Eardrum**\n\n* Bad ear infection\n* Dysfunction of the eustachian tube\n* Sticking something inside the ear canal\n* Surgery to place ear tubes\n* Trauma\n\nIf the eardrum has a small hole, myringoplasty may work to close it.

It may make you feel like eating more.\n\nAsk others to prepare food for you. You may feel like eating, but you might not have enough energy to cook.\n\nMake eating pleasant.\n\n*   Use soft lighting and play relaxing music.\n*   Eat with family or friends.\n*   Listen to the radio.\n*   Try new recipes or new foods.\n\nWhen you feel up to it, make some simple meals and freeze them to eat later. Ask your provider about \"Meals on Wheels\" or other programs that bring food to your house.\n\n**Ways to Add Calories to Your Food**\n\nIf your provider says it's OK, you can add calories to your food by doing the following:\n\n*   Add butter or margarine to foods when you are cooking, or put them on foods that are already cooked.\n*   Add cream sauce or melt cheese over vegetables.\n*   Eat peanut butter sandwiches, or put peanut butter on vegetables or fruits, such as carrots or apples.\n*   Mix whole milk or half-and-half with canned soups.\n*   Add protein supplements to yogurt, milkshakes, fruit smoothies, or pudding.\n*   Drink milkshakes between meals.\n*   Add honey to juices.\n\nAsk your provider about liquid nutrition drinks.\n\nAlso ask your provider about any medicines that can stimulate your appetite to help you eat.\n\n---\n\n**Eating Extra Calories When Sick**\n\nAs a adult, when you're feeling under the weather, it's essential to consume more calories to help your body recover.

Eating extra calories can help ensure that your body gets the fuel it needs to heal.\n\n**How Many Extra Calories Do I Need?**\n\nThe number of extra calories you need will depend on your individual circumstances. However, as a general rule of thumb, most adults need an additional 250-500 calories per day when they're sick. This can be achieved by eating more frequent, smaller meals or snacks throughout the day.\n\n**What Should I Eat?**\n\nWhen you're sick, it's essential to eat nutrient-rich foods that are easy to digest. Good options include:\n\n*   Soups\n*   Smoothies\n*   Pureed fruits and vegetables\n*   Lean proteins like chicken or fish\n*   Whole grains like rice or bread\n\n**Tips for Eating Extra Calories When Sick**\n\nHere are some additional tips to help you eat extra calories when you're sick:\n\n*   **Eat frequently**: Aim for 5-6 meals per day, spaced out every 2-3 hours.\n*   **Choose easy-to-digest foods**: Opt for soft, pureed, or liquid foods that are gentle on your stomach.\n*   **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of fluids, such as water, clear broth, or electrolyte-rich beverages like sports drinks.\n*   **Consult with your doctor**: Your healthcare provider can provide personalized guidance on how many extra calories you need and what types of foods are best for your specific situation.\n\nBy following these tips and eating extra calories when you're sick, you can help your body recover more efficiently and get back to feeling your best.",
