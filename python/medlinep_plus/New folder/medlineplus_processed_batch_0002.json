    "content": "**AGPAT2 Gene**\n\nThe AGPAT2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in many of the body's cells and tissues. It plays a critical role in the growth and development of adipocytes, which are cells that store fats for energy. Adipocytes are the major component of the body's fatty (adipose) tissue.\n\nThe AGPAT2 enzyme is part of a chemical pathway in many cells that produces two important types of fats (lipids): glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerols. Glycerophospholipids are the major component of cell membranes and are involved in chemical signaling within cells. Triacylglycerols (also known as triglycerides) are fat molecules that are stored in adipocytes for later conversion to energy.\n\nThe AGPAT2 enzyme is responsible for a particular chemical reaction in the production of these two types of lipids. Specifically, the enzyme helps convert a molecule called lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to another molecule, phosphatidic acid (PA). Additional reactions convert phosphatidic acid to glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerols.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nCongenital generalized lipodystrophy\n\nAt least 26 mutations in the AGPAT2 gene have been identified in people with congenital generalized lipodystrophy (also called Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy) type 1. This rare condition is characterized by an almost total absence of adipose tissue and a very muscular appearance. A shortage of adipose tissue leads to multiple health problems, including high levels of triglycerides circulating in the bloodstream (hypertriglyceridemia) and diabetes mellitus.\n\nThe AGPAT2 gene mutations that cause congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 1 greatly reduce or eliminate the activity of the AGPAT2 enzyme. Studies suggest that a loss of this enzyme's activity reduces the production and storage of triacylglycerols in adipocytes, which prevents these cells from storing fats.\n\n---\n\n**AGPAT2 Gene**\n\nThe AGPAT2 gene plays a crucial role in the production and storage of triacylglycerols in adipocytes, which are specialized cells that store fats.

    "content": "**AGPS Gene**\n\nThe AGPS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme known as alkylglycerone phosphate synthase. This enzyme is found in structures called peroxisomes, which are sac-like compartments within cells that contain enzymes needed to break down many different substances. Peroxisomes are also important for the production of fats (lipids) used in digestion and in the nervous system.\n\nWithin peroxisomes, alkylglycerone phosphate synthase is responsible for a critical step in the production of lipid molecules called plasmalogens. These molecules are found in cell membranes throughout the body. They are also abundant in myelin, which is the protective substance that covers nerve cells. However, little is known about the functions of plasmalogens. Researchers suspect that these molecules may help protect cells from oxidative stress, which occurs when unstable molecules called free radicals accumulate to levels that damage or kill cells. Plasmalogens may also play important roles in interactions between lipids and proteins, the transmission of chemical signals in cells, and the fusion of cell membranes.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Rhizomelic Chondrodysplasia Punctata**: At least three mutations in the AGPS gene have been found to cause rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 3 (RCDP3).

This process takes place within the peroxisome and is essential for several cellular activities, such as ridding the cell of toxic substances and helping to break down certain fats.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nMore than 175 mutations in the AGXT gene have been found to cause primary hyperoxaluria type 1. This condition is caused by the overproduction of a substance called oxalate, leading to kidney and bladder stones, which can begin anytime from childhood to early adulthood with kidney disease developing at any age.\n\nDeposition of oxalate in multiple other tissues throughout the body (systemic oxalosis) can cause additional health problems.

    "content": "**AIP Gene**\n\nThe AIP gene provides instructions for making a protein called AH receptor-interacting protein (AIP). Although AIP's function is not well understood, it is known to interact with numerous other proteins, including one called the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Through these interactions, AIP likely helps regulate certain cell processes, such as:\n\n*   The growth and division (proliferation) of cells\n*   The process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation)\n*   Cell survival\n\nThis protein is thought to act as a tumor suppressor, which means it normally helps prevent cells from proliferating in an uncontrolled way.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nMutations in the AIP gene cause 15 to 25 percent of cases of familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA), an inherited condition characterized by development of a noncancerous tumor in the pituitary gland (called a pituitary adenoma). This small gland at the base of the brain produces hormones that control many important body functions.\n\nAffected individuals within the same family may develop the same type of pituitary adenoma or different types. People with a mutation in the AIP gene most commonly develop a type of pituitary adenoma called a somatotropinoma. FIPA tumors caused by AIP gene mutations usually occur at a younger age and are larger than those without AIP gene mutations.\n\nMany kinds of mutations in the AIP gene have been identified in affected families. Some of these changes lead to an abnormally short protein or no protein at all. Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in AIP. Although it is unclear how these mutations are involved in tumor development, researchers believe that the alterations disrupt interaction between AIP and one or more other proteins.\n\nThe ability of AIP to control cell proliferation may be reduced, allowing pituitary cells to grow and divide unchecked and form a tumor. It is not known why the pituitary gland is specifically affected or why certain types of pituitary adenomas develop.\n\n**More About This Health Condition**\n\nEven before FIPA was defined as a condition, doctors recognized that somatotropinomas could occur in multiple members of a family. They referred to these tumors as isolated familial somatotropinoma. These tumors produce and release excess growth hormone (also called somatotropin), which promotes growth of the body.\n\nBecause it can cause overgrowth of the hands, feet, and face (acromegaly), the condition is also referred to as familial isolated acromegaly. Later, researchers discovered that isolated familial somatotropinoma can be caused by mutations in the AIP gene, and these tumors are now considered part of FIPA.\n\n---\n\n**AIP Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nMutations in the AIP gene are found in a small percentage of individuals with sporadic macroadenomas, which are large (macro-) pituitary adenomas that occur in individuals with no history of the condition in their family. When caused by AIP gene mutations, the tumors occur at a relatively young age, usually before age 30. Although other family members are not affected, the gene mutation is often inherited from a parent who never developed an adenoma.\n\n**Familial Isolated Pituitary Adenoma**\n\nMutations in the AIP gene cause 15 to 25 percent of cases of familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA), an inherited condition characterized by development of a noncancerous tumor in the pituitary gland (called a pituitary adenoma).

    "content": "**AIRE Gene**\n\nThe AIRE gene provides instructions for making a protein called the autoimmune regulator. This protein is active primarily in the thymus, an organ located behind the breastbone that plays an important role in immune system function.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nFor a person to remain healthy, immune system cells such as T cells must be able to identify and destroy potentially harmful invaders (such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses) while sparing the body's normal tissues. The autoimmune regulator protein plays an important role in this process by helping T cells distinguish the body's own proteins from those of foreign invaders.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nMore than 90 mutations in the AIRE gene have been identified in people with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED). APECED is an inherited condition that affects many of the body's organs. A major feature of this disorder is chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), which is a tendency to develop infections of the skin, the nails, and the moist lining of body cavities (mucous membranes) caused by a type of fungus called Candida.\n\nThe AIRE gene mutations that cause APECED lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the autoimmune regulator protein or change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in critical regions of the protein. These mutations reduce or eliminate the function of the autoimmune regulator protein. Without enough of this protein function, the immune system's ability to distinguish between the body's proteins and foreign invaders is impaired, and immune cells may attack the body's own organs, resulting in autoimmunity.\n\nStudies suggest that AIRE gene mutations also result in immune substances (antibodies) mistakenly attacking proteins involved in an immune process called the IL-17 pathway, which is important in the body's defense against Candida. This pathway, which depends on specialized proteins called IL-17 cytokines for signaling, creates inflammation, sending additional cytokines and white blood cells to fight foreign invaders and promote tissue repair.\n\n**Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy-Candidiasis-Ectodermal Dystrophy**\n\nAPECED is an inherited condition that affects many of the body's organs. A major feature of this disorder is chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), which is a tendency to develop infections of the skin, the nails, and the moist lining of body cavities (mucous membranes) caused by a type of fungus called Candida.

These polymorphisms alter single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the AKT1 gene. It is unknown whether the genetic changes have an effect on the structure or function of AKT1 kinase, and if so, how they are related to the development of schizophrenia.\n\n* **Proteus Syndrome**\n  At least one mutation in the AKT1 gene has been found to cause Proteus syndrome, a rare condition characterized by overgrowth of the bones, skin, and other tissues. This mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in AKT1 kinase. Specifically, it replaces the amino acid glutamic acid with the amino acid lysine at protein position 17 (written as Glu17Lys or E17K). The mutation is not inherited from a parent; in people with Proteus syndrome, the mutation arises randomly in one cell during the early stages of development before birth. As cells continue to grow and divide, some cells will have the mutation and other cells will not. This mixture of cells with and without a genetic mutation is known as mosaicism.\n\n* **Cowden Syndrome**\n  MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Cowden syndrome\n\n* **Ovarian Cancer**\n  MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Ovarian cancer\n\n* **Schizophrenia**\n  MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Schizophrenia\n\n* **Cancers**\n  The Glu17Lys mutation in the AKT1 gene (described above) has also been found in a small percentage of breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers.

    "content": "**AKT3 Gene**\n\nThe AKT3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is most active in the nervous system. The AKT3 protein is a key regulator of a chemical signaling pathway called the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. This signaling influences many critical cell functions, including the creation (synthesis) of new proteins, cell growth and division (proliferation), and the survival of cells.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is essential for the normal development of many parts of the body, including the brain. Studies suggest that the AKT3 protein plays a critical role in determining brain size.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nSeveral mutations in the AKT3 gene have been found to cause megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome. This rare condition affects the development of the brain, causing an unusually large brain and head size (megalencephaly) and other abnormalities of the brain's structure.\n\nEach of the known mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the AKT3 protein. These changes are described as \"gain-of-function\" because they increase the activity of the protein. This enhanced activity increases chemical signaling through the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, which causes excessive cell growth and division. The increased number of cells leads to rapid and abnormal brain growth starting before birth.\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nChanges involving the AKT3 gene are also involved in other disorders of brain growth. Megalencephaly without the other features of MPPH syndrome has been associated with gain-of-function AKT3 gene mutations or extra copies (duplication) of the region of chromosome 1 containing the AKT3 gene.\n\nThese genetic changes increase the amount or activity of the AKT3 protein, which enhances chemical signaling through the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and causes excessive cell growth and division, particularly in the brain. Other genetic changes involving the AKT3 gene are associated with an unusually small brain and head size (microcephaly).\n\n---\n\n**AKT3 Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Changes Involving the AKT3 Gene**\n\nSeveral mutations in the AKT3 gene have been found to cause megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome.

These changes include a deletion of the AKT3 gene or a loss of the region of chromosome 1 containing the AKT3 gene. The resulting reduction in AKT3 protein activity likely decreases signaling through the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and restricts cell growth and division in the developing brain.\n\nChanges involving the AKT3 gene can also cause a brain malformation called isolated hemimegalencephaly. This brain abnormality is an enlargement of one of the two major halves (hemispheres) of the cerebrum, which is the large part of the brain that controls most voluntary activity, language, sensory perception, learning, and memory.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* PKB gamma\n* PKB-GAMMA\n* PKBG\n* PRKBG\n* RAC-gamma\n* RAC-PK-gamma\n* STK-2\n* v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 3 (protein kinase B, gamma)\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed\n\n---\n\n**AKT3 Gene**\n\nThe AKT3 gene is involved in various disorders, including megalencephaly-related syndromes such as MPPH and MCAP.\n\n**References**\n\n* Ballif BC, Rosenfeld JA, Traylor R, Theisen A, Bader PI, Ladda RL, Sell SL, Steinraths M, Surti U, McGuire M, Williams S, Farrell SA, Filiano J, Schnur RE, Coffey LB, Tervo RC, Stroud T, Marble M, Netzloff M, Hanson K, Aylsworth AS, Bamforth JS, Babu D, Niyazov DM, Ravnan JB, Schultz RA, Lamb AN, Torchia BS, Bejjani BA, Shaffer LG.

    "content": "**ALAS2 Gene**\n\nThe ALAS2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 5'-aminolevulinate synthase 2 or erythroid ALA-synthase.

Heme is a component of iron-containing proteins called hemoproteins, including hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the blood). Heme is vital for all of the body's organs, although it is most abundant in the blood, bone marrow, and liver.\n\nThe production of heme is a multi-step process that requires eight different enzymes.

Each of these mutations deletes a small amount of genetic material near the end of the ALAS2 gene. These changes overactivate erythroid ALA-synthase, which increases the production of ALA within red blood cells. The excess ALA is converted by other enzymes to compounds called porphyrins. If these compounds build up in erythroblasts, they can leak out and be transported through the bloodstream to the skin and other tissues.\n* **X-linked Sideroblastic Anemia**\n\t+ At least 50 mutations that cause X-linked sideroblastic anemia have been identified in the ALAS2 gene. Almost all of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in erythroid ALA-synthase. These changes impair the activity of the enzyme, which disrupts the normal production of heme in developing red blood cells. A reduction in the amount of heme prevents these cells from making enough hemoglobin. Because almost all of the iron transported into erythroblasts is normally incorporated into heme, the reduced production of heme leads to a buildup of excess iron in these cells. Additionally, the body attempts to compensate for the hemoglobin shortage by absorbing more iron from the diet. This buildup of excess iron can damage the body's organs. Low hemoglobin levels and the resulting accumulation of iron in the body's organs lead to the characteristic features of X-linked sideroblastic anemia.\n\n---\n\n**ALAS2 Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/3)**\n\n**What is the ALAS2 gene?**\n\nThe ALAS2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase, which is involved in the production of heme. Heme is an important molecule that contains iron and plays a critical role in the functioning of red blood cells.\n\n**How does the ALAS2 gene work?**\n\nThe ALAS2 gene produces a protein called erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase, which is responsible for converting a compound called delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) into porphyrins. Porphyrins are then converted into heme through a series of chemical reactions.\n\n**What happens when the ALAS2 gene is mutated?**\n\nMutations in the ALAS2 gene can lead to two different conditions: X-linked dominant erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked sideroblastic anemia. In both cases, the mutations affect the production of heme, leading to a buildup of porphyrins in the skin and other tissues.\n\n**X-linked Dominant Erythropoietic Protoporphyria**\n\nAt least two ALAS2 gene mutations have been found in people with X-linked dominant erythropoietic protoporphyria. These mutations delete a small amount of genetic material near the end of the ALAS2 gene, leading to an overactivation of erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase. This overactivation increases the production of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), which is then converted into porphyrins.\n\n**X-linked Sideroblastic Anemia**\n\nAt least 50 mutations that cause X-linked sideroblastic anemia have been identified in the ALAS2 gene. Almost all of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase, impairing its activity and disrupting the normal production of heme in developing red blood cells.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\nThe ALAS2 gene is also known as:\n\n* 5-aminolevulinate synthase\n* Erythroid-specific 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS)\n* Erythroid ALAS-E aminolevulinate\n* Delta-aminolevulinate synthase 2 (ANH1)\n* ASB\n* HEM0_HUMAN\n\n**References**\n\nThe following references provide additional information on the ALAS2 gene:\n\n* Ajioka RS, Phillips JD, Kushner JP.

    "content": "**ALDH18A1 Gene**\n\nThe ALDH18A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as P5CS. This protein is found in cell structures called mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers of cells.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe formation of proline is a multi-step process that converts the amino acid glutamate to the amino acid proline. The P5CS protein carries out the first step in this process by converting the amino acid glutamate to glutamate 5-semialdehyde. Subsequent steps convert this intermediate product to the amino acid proline.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Cutis Laxa**\n    Variants (also known as mutations) in the ALDH18A1 gene can cause two different types of cutis laxa: autosomal dominant cutis laxa type 3 (ADCL3) and autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 3A (ARCL3A, which is also known as de Barsy syndrome).\n\n    In autosomal dominant cutis laxa, one copy of the altered ALDH18A1 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the characteristic features of the disorder. In autosomal recessive cutis laxa, both copies of the gene in each cell must be altered to result in the condition.\n\n    These types of cutis laxa feature loose, wrinkled, and sagging skin that is often described as parchment-like; prominent veins; loose joints; clouding of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts) or other eye abnormalities; intellectual disability; and movement problems that can worsen over time. Autosomal recessive cutis laxa tends to be more severe than autosomal dominant.\n\n    Most ALDH18A1 gene variants involved in cutis laxa result in production of a P5CS protein with reduced activity. Some studies suggest that in ADCL3A, the abnormal protein from the altered copy of the gene interferes with the protein produced from the normal copy, further reducing the activity of this protein in cells.\n\n    While the amount of proline is reduced in some people with ALDH18A1 gene variants, the levels are normal in other affected individuals. Impairment of the P5CS protein may disrupt mitochondrial function, which could lead to the death of skin and nerve cells. However, it is unclear exactly how changes in the ALDH18A1 gene lead to the particular signs and symptoms of cutis laxa.\n\n---\n\n**ALDH18A1 Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Other Disorders**\n    *   Variants in the ALDH18A1 gene can cause autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia type 9A (SPG9A) and autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 9B (SPG9B).\n    *   These conditions are part of a group of genetic disorders known as hereditary spastic paraplegias, characterized by muscle stiffness and paralysis of the lower limbs.\n    *   Other features can include clouding of the lenses of the eyes, developmental delay, or intellectual disability.\n*   **Cutis Laxa**\n    *   Variants in the ALDH18A1 gene can cause two different types of cutis laxa: autosomal dominant cutis laxa type 3 (ADCL3) and autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 3A (ARCL3A, also known as de Barsy syndrome).\n    *   These conditions feature loose, wrinkled, and sagging skin; prominent veins; loose joints; clouding of the lenses of the eyes or other eye abnormalities; intellectual disability; and movement problems that can worsen over time.\n    *   Autosomal recessive cutis laxa tends to be more severe than autosomal dominant.\n\n---\n\n**ALDH18A1 Gene**\n\n**What is the ALDH18A1 gene?**\n\nThe ALDH18A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called Delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS). This protein plays a crucial role in the production of proline, an amino acid that is important for energy production in cells.\n\n**What conditions are caused by variants in the ALDH18A1 gene?**\n\nVariants in the ALDH18A1 gene can cause autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia type 9A (SPG9A) and autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 9B (SPG9B). These conditions are part of a group of genetic disorders known as hereditary spastic paraplegias, which are characterized by muscle stiffness (spasticity) and the development of paralysis of the lower limbs (paraplegia) caused by breakdown of nerve cells that trigger muscle movement (motor neurons).\n\n**Other features of SPG9A or SPG9B**\n\nOther features of SPG9A or SPG9B can include clouding of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts), developmental delay, or intellectual disability.\n\n**How do variants in the ALDH18A1 gene affect the body?**\n\nThe ALDH18A1 gene variants are thought to reduce the function of the P5CS protein. Researchers suspect that impairment of the proline synthesis pathway hinders energy production in mitochondria, which may contribute to the death of neurons and lead to the progressive movement problems of SPG9A and SPG9B; however, the exact mechanism that causes these conditions is unknown.\n\n**References**\n\n* Bicknell LS, Pitt J, Aftimos S, Ramadas R, Maw MA, Robertson SP.

    "content": "**ALDOB Gene**\n\nThe ALDOB gene provides instructions for making the aldolase B enzyme. This enzyme is one of a group of three aldolase enzymes that are responsible for breaking down certain molecules in cells throughout the body.\n\n* Four identical aldolase B enzymes need to be attached (bound) to each other in a four-enzyme unit called a tetramer to work.\n* Aldolase B is found primarily in the liver, but it is also present at lower levels in kidney and intestinal cells.\n* Aldolase B is involved in the breakdown (metabolism) of the simple sugar fructose, which is found mostly in fruits and is used in the body for energy.\n* Aldolase B is responsible for the second step in the metabolism of fructose, which breaks down the molecule fructose-1-phosphate into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate.\n* To a lesser degree, aldolase B is also involved in the breakdown of the simple sugar glucose.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nHereditary Fructose Intolerance\n\nMore than 50 mutations in the ALDOB gene have been found to cause hereditary fructose intolerance, a condition characterized by nausea and intestinal discomfort following ingestion of foods containing fructose. Most of these mutations replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the aldolase B enzyme and result in the production of an enzyme with reduced function.\n\n* A mutation found in approximately half of people with hereditary fructose intolerance replaces the amino acid alanine with the amino acid proline at position 149 in the enzyme (written as Ala149Pro or A149P).\n* This mutation alters the 3-dimensional shape of the enzyme, making it difficult for the aldolase B enzymes to bind together and form tetramers.\n* If it is not in a tetramer, aldolase B cannot metabolize fructose.\n* A lack of functional aldolase B results in an accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate in liver cells, which is toxic and leads to the death of liver cells over time.\n* Additionally, the breakdown products of fructose-1-phosphase are needed in the body to produce energy and to maintain blood glucose levels.\n\n---\n\n**Hereditary Fructose Intolerance**\n\nHereditary fructose intolerance is a condition characterized by nausea and intestinal discomfort following ingestion of foods containing fructose. This condition is caused by mutations in the ALDOB gene, which codes for the aldolase B enzyme.\n\n**The Role of Aldolase B Enzyme**\n\nAldolase B enzyme plays a crucial role in breaking down fructose-1-phosphate into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The breakdown products of fructose-1-phosphase are needed in the body to produce energy and maintain blood glucose levels.\n\n**Consequences of Aldolase B Deficiency**\n\nA lack of functional aldolase B results in an accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate in liver cells, which is toxic and leads to the death of liver cells over time. This combination of decreased cellular energy, low blood glucose, and liver cell death leads to the features of hereditary fructose intolerance.\n\n**Other Names for the ALDOB Gene**\n\n*   ALDB\n*   ALDO2\n*   aldolase 2\n*   aldolase B, fructose-bisphosphatase\n*   aldolase B, fructose-bisphosphate\n*   liver-type aldolase\n\n**References**\n\n*   Dalby AR, Tolan DR, Littlechild JA.

Many affected individuals develop seizures that can be difficult to treat. Individuals with ALG1-CDG may also have movement problems such as involuntary rhythmic shaking (tremor) or difficulties with movement and balance (ataxia).\n\nPeople with ALG1-CDG often have problems with blood clotting, which can lead to abnormal clotting or bleeding episodes. Additionally, affected individuals may produce abnormally low levels of proteins called antibodies (or immunoglobulins), particularly immunoglobulin G (IgG). Antibodies help protect the body against infection by foreign particles and germs. A reduction in antibodies can make it difficult for affected individuals to fight infections.\n\nSome people with ALG1-CDG have physical abnormalities such as a small head size (microcephaly); unusual facial features; joint deformities called contractures; long, slender fingers and toes (arachnodactyly); or unusually fleshy pads at the tips of the fingers and toes. Eye problems that may occur in people with this condition include eyes that do not point in the same direction (strabismus) or involuntary eye movements (nystagmus). Rarely, affected individuals develop vision loss.\n\nLess common abnormalities that occur in people with ALG1-CDG include respiratory problems, reduced sensation in their arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy), swelling (edema), and gastrointestinal difficulties.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nALG1-CDG appears to be a rare disorder; fewer than 30 affected individuals have been described in the scientific literature.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the ALG1 gene cause ALG1-CDG. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is involved in a process called glycosylation. During this process, complex chains of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) are added to proteins and fats (lipids). Glycosylation modifies proteins and lipids so they can fully perform their functions.\n\nThe enzyme produced from the ALG1 gene transfers a simple sugar called mannose to growing oligosaccharides at a particular step in the formation of the sugar chain.

The poorly functioning enzyme cannot add mannose to sugar chains efficiently, and the resulting oligosaccharides are often incomplete. Although the short oligosaccharides can be transferred to proteins and fats, the process is not as efficient as with the full-length oligosaccharide.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n---\n\n**ALG1-congenital disorder of glycosylation**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.

    "content": "**ALG6-congenital disorder of glycosylation**\n\nALG6-congenital disorder of glycosylation (ALG6-CDG, also known as congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ic) is an inherited condition that affects many parts of the body. The signs and symptoms of ALG6-CDG vary widely among people with the condition.\n\n**Description**\n\nIndividuals with ALG6-CDG typically develop signs and symptoms of the condition during infancy. They may have difficulty gaining weight and growing at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Affected infants often have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and developmental delay.\n\nPeople with ALG6-CDG may have seizures, problems with coordination and balance (ataxia), or stroke-like episodes that involve an extreme lack of energy (lethargy) and temporary paralysis. They may also develop blood clotting disorders. Some individuals with ALG6-CDG have eye abnormalities including eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus) and an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa, which causes vision loss. Females with ALG6-CDG have hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, which affects the production of hormones that direct sexual development. As a result, most females with ALG6-CDG do not go through puberty.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThe prevalence of ALG6-CDG is unknown, but it is thought to be the second most common type of congenital disorder of glycosylation. More than 30 cases of ALG6-CDG have been described in the scientific literature.\n\n**Causes**\n\nALG6-CDG is caused by mutations in the ALG6 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is involved in a process called glycosylation. Glycosylation is the process by which sugar molecules (monosaccharides) and complex chains of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) are added to proteins and fats. The enzyme produced from the ALG6 gene transfers a simple sugar called glucose to the growing oligosaccharide. Once the correct number of sugar molecules are linked together, the oligosaccharide is attached to a protein or fat.\n\nALG6 gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormal enzyme with reduced or no activity. Without a properly functioning enzyme, glycosylation cannot proceed normally, and oligosaccharides are incomplete. As a result, glycosylation is reduced or absent.\n\n---\n\n**ALG6-congenital disorder of glycosylation**\n\nThe wide variety of signs and symptoms in ALG6-CDG are likely due to impaired glycosylation of proteins and fats that are needed for normal function in many organs and tissues, including the brain, eyes, liver, and hormone-producing (endocrine) system.\n\n**Causes of ALG6-CDG**\n\nALG6-CDG is caused by mutations in the ALG6 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is involved in a process called glycosylation. Glycosylation is the process by which sugar molecules (monosaccharides) and complex chains of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) are added to proteins and fats.

ALG6 gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormal enzyme with reduced or no activity. Without a properly functioning enzyme, glycosylation cannot proceed normally, and oligosaccharides are incomplete.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nALG6-CDG is also known as:\n\n* Carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome type Ic\n* Carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome type V\n* CDG syndrome type Ic\n* CDG1C\n* CDGIc\n* Congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ic\n* Glucosyltransferase 1 deficiency\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on ALG6-CDG, you can visit the following resources:\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: ALG6-congenital disorder of glycosylation 1C\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: ALG6-CDG\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: CONGENITAL DISORDER OF GLYCOSYLATION, TYPE Ic; CDG1C\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed: Various studies on ALG6-CDG\n\n**References**\n\nFor further reading on ALG6-CDG, you can consult the following references:\n\n* Damen G, de Klerk H, Huijmans J, den Hollander J, Sinaasappel M.

    "content": "**ALK Gene**\n\nThe **ALK gene** provides instructions for making a protein called **ALK receptor tyrosine kinase**, which is part of a family of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Receptor tyrosine kinases transmit signals from the cell surface into the cell through a process called signal transduction.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe process begins when the kinase is stimulated at the cell surface and then attaches to a similar kinase (dimerizes). After dimerization, the kinase is tagged with a marker called a phosphate group in a process called phosphorylation. Phosphorylation turns on (activates) the kinase. The activated kinase is able to transfer a phosphate group to another protein inside the cell, which is activated as a result.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Neuroblastoma**: At least 16 mutations in the ALK gene have been identified in some people with neuroblastoma, a type of cancerous tumor composed of immature nerve cells (neuroblasts). Mutations in the ALK gene change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in ALK receptor tyrosine kinase. The most common mutation in neuroblastoma replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid glutamine at position 1275 (written as Arg1275Gln or R1275Q).\n\n---\n\n**ALK Gene**\n\nThis phenomenon, known as gene amplification, results in overexpression of ALK receptor tyrosine kinase.\n\n**Mutated or Overexpressed ALK Receptor Tyrosine Kinase**\n\nMutated or overexpressed ALK receptor tyrosine kinase no longer requires stimulation from outside the cell to be phosphorylated. As a result, the kinase and the downstream signaling pathway are constantly turned on (constitutively activated).\n\n**Constitutive Activation of ALK Receptor Tyrosine Kinase**\n\nConstitutive activation of ALK receptor tyrosine kinase may increase the proliferation of immature nerve cells, leading to neuroblastoma.\n\n**Neuroblastoma**\n\nAt least 16 mutations in the ALK gene have been identified in some people with neuroblastoma, a type of cancerous tumor composed of immature nerve cells (neuroblasts). Neuroblastoma and other cancers occur when a buildup of genetic mutations in critical genes—those that control cell proliferation or differentiation—allows cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor.\n\n**ALK Gene Mutations**\n\nMutations in the ALK gene change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in ALK receptor tyrosine kinase. The most common mutation in neuroblastoma replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid glutamine at position 1275 (written as Arg1275Gln or R1275Q).\n\n**Gene Amplification**\n\nOccasionally, extra copies of the ALK gene are found in people with neuroblastoma. This phenomenon, known as gene amplification, results in overexpression of ALK receptor tyrosine kinase.\n\n**ALK Gene and Cancer**\n\nThe presence of the partner protein allows phosphorylation of ALK receptor tyrosine kinase without dimerization. The fusion protein and signaling pathways activated by ALK receptor tyrosine kinase are constitutively activated, which may abnormally increase the proliferation of immature nerve cells, leading to cancer formation.\n\n**ALK Gene and Neuroblastoma**\n\nAt least 16 mutations in the ALK gene have been identified in some people with neuroblastoma. Somatic mutations in the ALK gene occur during the development of some cases of sporadic neuroblastoma, and inherited mutations in the ALK gene increase the risk of developing familial neuroblastoma.\n\n**ALK Gene and Lung Cancer**\n\nRearrangements of genetic material involving the ALK gene on chromosome 2 increase the risk of developing several other types of cancer. These rearrangements are somatic mutations, which means they occur during a person's lifetime and are present only in the cells that become cancerous.\n\n---\n\n**ALK Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 3/4)**\n\nThe ALK gene, located on chromosome 2, plays a crucial role in neuroblastoma and other cancers. Mutations in the ALK gene can lead to the development of cancer.\n\n**Mutations in Neuroblastoma**\n\nIn neuroblastoma, the most common mutation replaces the amino acid arginine with glutamine at position 1275 (Arg1275Gln or R1275Q). This mutation has been found in both familial and sporadic neuroblastoma. Extra copies of the ALK gene are also found in people with neuroblastoma, resulting in overexpression of the receptor tyrosine kinase.\n\n**Constitutive Activation**\n\nMutated or overexpressed ALK receptor tyrosine kinase no longer requires stimulation from outside the cell to be phosphorylated. As a result, the kinase and the downstream signaling pathway are constantly turned on (constitutively activated). This constitutive activation may increase the proliferation of immature nerve cells, leading to neuroblastoma.\n\n**Lung Cancer**\n\nRearrangements of genetic material involving the ALK gene on chromosome 2 increase the risk of developing several other types of cancer. These rearrangements are somatic mutations, which means they occur during a person's lifetime and are present only in the cells that become cancerous.\n\n**Translocations**\n\nOne type of rearrangement, called a translocation, exchanges genetic material between chromosome 2 and another chromosome. At least 15 translocations involving the ALK gene have been identified in people with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), a rare form of cancer involving immune cells called T cells.\n\n**Inversions**\n\nAnother type of rearrangement, called an inversion, occurs when chromosome 2 is broken in two places and the resulting piece of DNA is reversed and re-inserted into the chromosome. A small group of people with non-small cell lung cancer have an inversion of chromosome 2, fusing the ALK gene with another gene called EML4.\n\n**Fusion Proteins**\n\nThe fusion proteins created by these rearranged genes have functions of both ALK receptor tyrosine kinase and the partner protein. The presence of the partner protein allows phosphorylation of ALK receptor tyrosine kinase without dimerization. The fusion protein and signaling pathways activated by ALK receptor tyrosine kinase are constitutively activated, which may abnormally increase the proliferation of immature nerve cells, leading to cancer formation.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\nALK tyrosine kinase receptor\nanaplastic lymphoma kinase\nanaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase\nCD246\nCD246 antigen\nNBLST3\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nTests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry\n\n---\n\n**ALK Gene**\n\n**What is the ALK gene?**\n\nThe ALK gene provides instructions for making a protein called anaplastic lymphoma kinase, which plays a crucial role in cell signaling pathways.\n\n**Genomic Location**\n\nThe ALK gene is found on chromosome 2.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Genes and Gene Therapy\n* Genetic Disorders\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n* What is DNA?\n* What is a gene?\n* What is a gene variant and how do variants occur?\n\n**References**\n\n* Ardini E, Magnaghi P, Orsini P, Galvani A, Menichincheri M.

    "content": "**ALMS1 Gene**\n\nThe ALMS1 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. Researchers believe that the protein may play a role in hearing, vision, regulation of body weight, and functions of the heart, kidney, lungs, and liver. It may also affect how the pancreas regulates insulin, a hormone that helps control levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe ALMS1 protein is present in most of the body's tissues, usually at low levels. Within cells, this protein is located in structures called centrosomes. Centrosomes play a role in cell division and the assembly of microtubules, which are proteins that transport materials in cells and help the cell maintain its shape. The ALMS1 protein is also found at the base of cilia, which are finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. Almost all cells have cilia at some stage of their life cycle. Cilia are involved in cell movement and many different chemical signaling pathways.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Alström syndrome: More than 80 mutations in the ALMS1 gene have been identified in people with Alström syndrome. Most of these mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small version of the ALMS1 protein that does not function properly. Researchers propose that a lack of normally functioning ALMS1 protein in the brain could lead to overeating. A loss of this protein in the pancreas may cause insulin resistance, a condition in which the body cannot use insulin properly. The combined effects of overeating and insulin resistance impair the body's ability to handle excess glucose, leading to diabetes and obesity (two common features of Alström syndrome).\n\n---\n\n**ALMS1 Gene**\n\nThe ALMS1 gene is associated with Alström syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by obesity, type 2 diabetes, and neurosensory degeneration.\n\n**Function of the ALMS1 Protein**\n\nNormally functioning ALMS1 protein in the brain could lead to overeating.

    "content": "**ALOXE3 Gene**\n\nThe ALOXE3 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called eLOX3. This enzyme is part of a family of enzymes called arachidonate lipoxygenases.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\n* The ALOXE3 gene helps add an oxygen molecule to certain fatty acids to produce substances called fatty acid hydroperoxides.\n* Unlike other lipoxygenases, the eLOX3 enzyme does not act directly on fatty acids. Instead, it is involved in the step following the creation of fatty acid hydroperoxides.\n* The eLOX3 enzyme processes fatty acid hydroperoxides, which are later converted to signaling molecules that are involved in the formation of the layers of fats (lipids) within the outermost layer of the skin (the epidermis).\n* The lipid layers are necessary to prevent water loss (dehydration) through the skin.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NBCIE): At least 20 mutations in the ALOXE3 gene have been found to cause this condition.\n* This condition affects the skin and causes redness, fine white scales, an increased risk of infections, and excessive dehydration.\n* Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the eLOX3 enzyme. Many ALOXE3 gene mutations lead to the production of a nonfunctional eLOX3 enzyme, which disrupts the processing of the molecules involved in the formation of the lipid layers within the epidermis.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* E-LOX\n* e-LOX-3\n* eLOX3\n* Epidermal lipoxygenase\n* Loxe3_Human\n\n---\n\n**ALOXE3 Gene**\n\n**What is the ALOXE3 gene?**\n\nThe ALOXE3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called arachidonate lipoxygenase 3, which plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the skin.\n\n**Genomic Location**\n\nThe ALOXE3 gene is found on chromosome 17.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Genes and Gene Therapy\n* Genetic Disorders\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n* What is DNA?\n* What is a gene?\n* What is a gene variant and how do variants occur?\n\n**References**\n\n* Eckl KM, de Juanes S, Kurtenbach J, Natebus M, Lugassy J, Oji V, Traupe H, Preil ML, Martinez F, Smolle J, Harel A, Krieg P, Sprecher E, Hennies HC.

    "content": "**ALS2 Gene**\n\nThe ALS2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called alsin. Alsin is produced in a wide range of tissues, with highest amounts in the brain. This protein is particularly abundant in motor neurons, the specialized nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control the movement of muscles.\n\nAlsin turns on (activates) multiple proteins called GTPases that convert a molecule called GTP into another molecule called GDP. GTPases play important roles in cell division, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). The GTPases play important roles in several cell processes. The GTPases that are activated by alsin are involved in the proper placement of the various proteins and fats that make up the cell membrane, the transport of molecules from the cell membrane to the interior of the cell (endocytosis), and the development of specialized structures called axons and dendrites that project from neurons and are essential for the transmission of nerve impulses.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis**: MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about this health condition.\n*   **Infantile-onset ascending hereditary spastic paralysis**: At least 20 ALS2 gene mutations have been found to cause this disorder. It is characterized by progressive weakness and stiffness of muscles in the legs, arms, neck, and head that begins within the first 2 years of life. Mutations in the ALS2 gene alter the instructions for making alsin, often resulting in the production of an abnormally short alsin protein that is unstable and rapidly broken down.\n\n---\n\n**ALS2 Gene**\n\nThe ALS2 gene is responsible for producing alsin, a protein involved in various cellular processes. Mutations in the ALS2 gene have been linked to several neurological disorders.\n\n*   **Juvenile Primary Lateral Sclerosis**: Three mutations in the ALS2 gene have been identified as causing juvenile primary lateral sclerosis, a condition characterized by progressive weakness and stiffness of muscles in the arms, legs, and face that typically begins in childhood.\n*   **Infantile-Onset Ascending Hereditary Spastic Paralysis**: At least 20 ALS2 gene mutations have been found to cause infantile-onset ascending hereditary spastic paralysis, a disorder characterized by progressive weakness and stiffness of muscles in the legs, arms, neck, and head that begins within the first 2 years of life.\n\nMutations in the ALS2 gene alter the instructions for making alsin, often resulting in the production of an abnormally short alsin protein that is unstable and rapidly broken down. The loss of functional alsin protein may disrupt the movement of molecules within cells or impair the development of axons and dendrites, leading to the progressive atrophy of motor neurons characteristic of these conditions.\n\nThe exact mechanisms by which ALS2 gene mutations cause these disorders are unclear, but research suggests that a lack of alsin and the subsequent loss of GTPase functions contribute to the progression of these conditions.\n\n---\n\n**ALS2 Gene**\n\nThe ALS2 gene is associated with juvenile primary lateral sclerosis, a rare disorder characterized by the progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem.\n\n**Function of the ALS2 Gene**\n\nThe ALS2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called alsin. This protein plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of nerve cells, particularly motor neurons.

    "content": "**ALT Blood Test**\n\nAn ALT test measures the amount of ALT in your blood. This test is commonly used to help diagnose liver damage or disease.\n\n**What is ALT?**\n\nALT (alanine transaminase) is an enzyme, a protein that speeds up certain chemical reactions in your body. It is found mainly in your liver. Usually, you will have low levels of ALT in your blood. But when liver cells are damaged, they release ALT into the bloodstream. High levels of ALT in your blood may be a sign of a liver injury or disease.\n\n**What is an ALT test used for?**\n\nAn ALT blood test is often part of a routine blood screening to check the health of your liver. The test may also help diagnose or monitor liver problems.\n\n**Why do I need an ALT blood test?**\n\nYour health care provider may order an ALT blood test as part of a routine checkup. An ALT test is usually done with a group of other liver function tests that check how well your liver is working. Many liver function tests are included in a common blood test called a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP).\n\n**When might I need an ALT blood test?**\n\nThese tests may also be ordered if you have symptoms of liver damage, such as:\n\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Lack of appetite\n* Fatigue\n* Weakness\n* Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow\n* Swelling and/or pain in your abdomen (belly)\n* Swelling in your ankles and legs\n* Dark-colored urine (pee) and/or light-colored stool (poop)\n* Frequent itching\n\nYour provider may also order an ALT blood test if you have a high risk of liver damage because of:\n\n* A family history of liver disease\n* Alcohol use disorder (AUD)\n* Obesity\n* Diabetes\n* Taking certain medicines that can cause liver damage\n* Hepatitis or exposure to hepatitis\n\n---\n\n**ALT Blood Test: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 2/3)**\n\n**What does an ALT blood test check?**\n\nAn ALT blood test checks for liver damage by measuring the amount of alanine transaminase (ALT) in your blood. Your provider may order an ALT blood test if you have symptoms of liver damage, such as:\n\n* Yellowing of your skin and eyes (jaundice)\n* Dark-colored urine (pee) and/or light-colored stool (poop)\n* Frequent itching\n* Nausea or vomiting\n\n**Who is at risk for liver damage?**\n\nYour provider may also order an ALT blood test if you have a high risk of liver damage because of:\n\n* A family history of liver disease\n* Alcohol use disorder (AUD)\n* Obesity\n* Diabetes\n* Taking certain medicines that can cause liver damage\n* Hepatitis or exposure to hepatitis\n\n**What happens during an ALT blood test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou may need to stop taking certain medicines before the test, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to. You usually need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before these tests.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nAn ALT blood test is often done as part of a group of liver function tests. Liver function tests measure several different proteins, substances, and enzymes that show how well your liver is working. Your provider usually compares your ALT results with the results of the other liver tests to evaluate your liver health and decide if you need other tests to make a diagnosis.\n\nLower-than-usual levels of ALT in your blood are not common. Your provider may do more tests since this may be a sign of:\n\n* B6 deficiency\n* Chronic kidney disease\n\nHigher-than-usual levels of ALT in your blood may be a sign of liver damage from:\n\n* Hepatitis\n* Infection\n* Cirrhosis\n* Liver cancer\n* Other liver diseases\n* A lack of blood flow to the liver\n* Certain medicines, such as cholesterol or pain medicines\n* Poisons\n\nIf your results show you have a high level of ALT, it doesn't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Many things can affect your results, such as your age, sex, weight, and certain medicines and dietary supplements. Your ALT levels can also be affected by intense exercise and where you are in your menstrual cycle.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about an ALT blood test?**\n\nALT test results may help tell the difference between damage from acute (sudden) liver problems and chronic (long-term) liver problems. But the amount of ALT in your blood isn't related to how much your liver may be damaged. Your ALT is usually measured along with another liver enzyme called AST as part of a liver function panel. Since ALT is mostly found in the liver, an ALT test checks more specifically for liver damage.\n\n---\n\n**ALT Blood Test**\n\nThe ALT blood test, also known as the alanine transaminase test, is a medically necessary test that measures the level of ALT enzyme in the blood. This test is used to diagnose and monitor liver damage or disease.\n\n**What does the ALT test check for?**\n\nThe ALT test checks for liver damage by measuring the level of ALT enzyme in the blood. Since ALT is mostly found in the liver, an ALT test is more specific for liver damage than other tests.\n\n**References:**\n\n* American Liver Foundation.

    "content": "**AMACR Gene**\n\nThe AMACR gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR). This enzyme is found in the energy-producing centers in cells (mitochondria) and in cell structures called peroxisomes. Peroxisomes contain a variety of enzymes that break down many different substances, including fatty acids and certain toxic compounds. They are also important for the production (synthesis) of fats (lipids) used in digestion and in the nervous system.\n\nIn peroxisomes, the AMACR enzyme plays a role in the breakdown of a fatty acid called pristanic acid, which comes from meat and dairy foods in the diet. In mitochondria, AMACR is thought to help further break down the molecules derived from pristanic acid.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase deficiency**: This disorder leads to a variety of neurological problems that begin in adulthood, including gradual loss in intellectual functioning (cognitive decline), seizures, and weakness and loss of sensation in the limbs due to nerve damage (sensorimotor neuropathy). Most individuals with AMACR deficiency have an AMACR gene mutation that replaces a protein building block (amino acid) called serine with an amino acid called proline at position 52 in the enzyme sequence, written as Ser52Pro or S52P. This mutation results in a lack (deficiency) of functional enzyme. The enzyme deficiency leads to accumulation of pristanic acid in the blood.\n*   **Congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 4**: AMACR gene mutations that result in a lack of functional AMACR enzyme have also been identified in infants with this life-threatening disorder. Babies with this disorder have cholestasis, which is a reduced ability to produce and release a digestive fluid called bile. Cholestasis leads to an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly) and irreversible liver disease (cirrhosis) in the first few months of life. Some researchers consider congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 4 and AMACR deficiency to be variations of the same disorder.\n\n---\n\n**AMACR Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n**Category:** general\n\n**Content:**\nThe AMACR gene is responsible for encoding the enzyme alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase, which plays a crucial role in the breakdown of fatty acids and pristanic acid.

This can result in structural defects in tooth enamel, such as a distinctive pattern of vertical grooves.\n\n**What is amelogenesis imperfecta?**\n\nAmelogenesis imperfecta is a disorder of tooth development caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome, including the AMELX gene. At least 23 mutations in the AMELX gene have been identified in people with this condition.\n\n**How does the AMELX gene affect males and females differently?**\n\nMales who inherit an altered copy of the AMELX gene have very little amelogenin and develop almost no enamel to cover and protect their teeth. Females who inherit one altered copy of the AMELX gene are less severely affected than males because they have a normal copy of the gene on the other X chromosome to produce amelogenin.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* AIH1\n* ALGN\n* amelogenin (amelogenesis imperfecta 1, X-linked)\n* amelogenin, X-linked\n* AMELX_HUMAN\n* AMG\n* AMGL\n* AMGX\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry: Tests of AMELX\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed: PubMed\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: AMELOGENIN; AMELX\n* Gene and Variant Databases: NCBI Gene, ClinVar\n\n**References**\n\n* Hu JC, Chan HC, Simmer SG, Seymen F, Richardson AS, Hu Y, Milkovich RN, Estrella NM, Yildirim M, Bayram M, Chen CF, Simmer JP.

    "content": "**AMER1 Gene**\n\nThe **AMER1 gene** provides instructions for making a protein found in tissues throughout the body where it helps regulate the Wnt signaling pathway, which is a series of chemical signals that affect the way cells and tissues develop. Wnt signaling is important for cell division, attachment of cells to one another (adhesion), cell movement (migration), and many other cell activities.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe AMER1 protein can promote cell growth by helping to turn on (activate) the Wnt pathway or prevent cell growth by helping to turn off (repress) the Wnt pathway. When repressing the pathway, the AMER1 protein is acting as a tumor suppressor, which means that it helps prevent cells from growing and dividing (proliferating) too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Wilms Tumor**: Mutations in the AMER1 gene have been found in Wilms tumor, a rare form of kidney cancer that occurs almost exclusively in children. These mutations are somatic, meaning that they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in kidney cells that give rise to the tumor.\n* **Osteopathia Striata with Cranial Sclerosis**: Mutations in the AMER1 gene that are present in cells throughout the body (called germline mutations) cause a bone disorder called osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis. This condition occurs almost exclusively in females because males with the disorder usually die before or soon after birth.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* More about Wilms tumor\n* More about osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis\n\n---\n\n**AMER1 Gene**\n\n**Other Cancers**\n\nIn addition to Wilms tumor, changes in the AMER1 gene have been reported to be associated with many other cancers. These mutations are somatic and are present only in cells that give rise to cancer. Studies have shown that AMER1 gene changes are associated with stomach (gastric), breast, and colorectal cancers. It is likely that these gene changes impair the protein's tumor suppressor function, allowing cells to proliferate without control or order, which leads to cancer development.\n\n**Wilms Tumor**\n\nMutations in the AMER1 gene have been found in Wilms tumor, a rare form of kidney cancer that occurs almost exclusively in children. These mutations are somatic, meaning that they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in kidney cells that give rise to the tumor. AMER1 gene mutations result in a protein with a reduced ability to repress Wnt signaling. As a result, Wnt signaling is increased, which leads to the unchecked proliferation of kidney cells and tumor development.\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nMutations in the AMER1 gene that are present in cells throughout the body (called germline mutations) cause a bone disorder called osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis. This condition occurs almost exclusively in females because males with the disorder usually die before or soon after birth. Affected females have excessive bone growth (hyperostosis), which leads to multiple skeletal abnormalities including an unusually large head (macrocephaly) and abnormal facial features. Males who survive infancy have bone abnormalities and heart, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary malformations. AMER1 gene mutations that cause osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis lead to a lack of functional AMER1 protein, disrupting its role in regulating the Wnt signaling pathway. It is unclear why these mutations primarily affect skeletal development.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* adenomatous polyposis coli membrane recruitment 1\n* FAM123B\n* family with sequence similarity 123B\n* FLJ39827\n* OSCS protein\n* FAM123B\n* RP11-403E24.2\n* Wilms tumor gene on the X chromosome protein\n* Wilms tumor on the X\n* WTX\n\n---\n\n**AMER1 Gene**\n\n**Category:** general\n\n**Genomic Location**\nThe AMER1 gene is found on the X chromosome.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Genes and Gene Therapy\n* Genetic Disorders\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n* What is DNA?\n* What is a gene?\n* What is a gene variant and how do variants occur?\n\n**References**\n\n* Gear R, Savarirayan R.

    "content": "**AMT Gene**\n\nThe AMT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aminomethyltransferase. This protein is one of four enzymes that work together in a group called the glycine cleavage system. Within cells, this system is active in specialized energy-producing centers called mitochondria.\n\nAs its name suggests, the glycine cleavage system breaks down a molecule called glycine by cutting (cleaving) it into smaller pieces. Glycine is an amino acid, which is a building block of proteins. This molecule also acts as a neurotransmitter, which is a chemical messenger that transmits signals in the brain. The breakdown of excess glycine when it is no longer needed is necessary for the normal development and function of nerve cells in the brain.\n\nThe breakdown of glycine by the glycine cleavage system produces a molecule called a methyl group. This molecule is added to and used by a vitamin called folate. Folate is required for many functions in the cell and is important for brain development.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Nonketotic Hyperglycinemia**\n    *   Mutations in the AMT gene account for about 20 percent of all cases of nonketotic hyperglycinemia.\n    *   This condition is characterized by abnormally high levels of glycine in the body (hyperglycinemia).\n    *   Affected individuals have serious neurological problems, including severe breathing difficulties shortly after birth, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures, and delayed development of milestones.\n    *   More than 70 mutations have been identified in affected individuals. Most of these genetic changes alter single amino acids in aminomethyltransferase.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   The breakdown of glycine by the glycine cleavage system produces a molecule called a methyl group, which is added to and used by folate.\n*   Folate is required for many functions in the cell and is important for brain development.\n\n---\n\n**Nonketotic Hyperglycinemia**\n\nNonketotic hyperglycinemia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormally high levels of glycine in the body (hyperglycinemia). Affected individuals have serious neurological problems, including severe breathing difficulties shortly after birth, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures, and delayed development of milestones.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the AMT gene account for about 20 percent of all cases of nonketotic hyperglycinemia. The AMT gene provides instructions for making aminomethyltransferase, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the breakdown of glycine. More than 70 mutations have been identified in affected individuals, most of which alter single amino acids in aminomethyltransferase.\n\n**Effects of Mutations**\n\nAMT gene mutations alter the structure and function of aminomethyltransferase. When an altered version of this enzyme is incorporated into the glycine cleavage system, it impairs the system's ability to break down glycine. Some AMT gene mutations reduce the activity of the glycine cleavage system, while others completely eliminate its activity. As a result, excess glycine can build up in the body's organs and tissues.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of nonketotic hyperglycinemia vary in severity and can include:\n\n* Severe breathing difficulties shortly after birth\n* Weak muscle tone (hypotonia)\n* Seizures\n* Delayed development of milestones\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\nGCE glycine cleavage system protein T NKH\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nTests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry\n\nScientific Articles on PubMed\n\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n\nGene and Variant Databases\n\nReferences:\n\nCoughlin CR 2nd, Swanson MA, Kronquist K, Acquaviva C, Hutchin T,\nRodriguez-Pombo P, Vaisanen ML, Spector E, Creadon-Swindell G, Bras-Goldberg AM,\nRahikkala E, Moilanen JS, Mahieu V, Matthijs G, Bravo-Alonso I, Perez-Cerda C,\nUgarte M, Vianey-Saban C, Scharer GH, Van Hove JL.

    "content": "**ANA (Antinuclear Antibody) Test**\n\nAn ANA test is a blood test that looks for antinuclear antibodies in your blood. Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to fight foreign substances, like viruses and bacteria. But an antinuclear antibody attacks your healthy cells instead. It's called \"antinuclear\" because it targets the nucleus of the cells, which is in charge of sending signals that are needed for important cell functions.\n\nIt's normal to have a few antinuclear antibodies in your blood. But a large number may be a sign of an autoimmune disorder. If you have an autoimmune disorder, your immune system attacks the healthy cells of your organs and tissues by mistake. These disorders can cause serious health problems.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nAn ANA test is used to help diagnose autoimmune disorders, such as:\n\n* Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the most common type of lupus.\n* Rheumatoid arthritis, a condition that mostly affects joints.\n* Scleroderma, a rare disease that may affect the skin, blood vessels, and organs.\n* Sjögren's syndrome, a rare disease that affects the glands that make tears and saliva (spit) and other parts of the body.\n* Addison Disease, which affects your adrenal glands (glands on top of the kidneys), causing fatigue and weakness.\n* Autoimmune hepatitis, which causes swelling in your liver.\n* Thyroid diseases, which can cause your thyroid to make too much or too little thyroid hormones.\n\n**Why do I need an ANA test?**\n\nYour health care provider may order an ANA test if you have symptoms of an autoimmune disorder. The symptoms depend on what part of your body is affected. They may include:\n\n* Fever\n* Rash, blisters, or skin color changes\n* Fatigue\n* Joint pain, stiffness, and swelling\n* Muscle pain\n* Swollen glands\n* Abdominal (belly) pain\n\n**What happens during an ANA test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nSome medicines may affect the results of your ANA test. You may need to stop taking certain medicines before this test, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nResults from an ANA test alone cannot diagnose a specific disease. Your provider will use your ANA test results along with other blood and imaging tests and information about your health to make a diagnosis.\n\nA negative result on an ANA test means that antinuclear antibodies were not found in your blood, and you're less likely to have an autoimmune disorder. But a negative ANA test doesn't completely rule out the possibility that you could have an autoimmune disorder.\n\nA positive result on an ANA test means that antinuclear antibodies were found in your blood. A positive result may be a sign of:\n\n* Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)\n* A different type of autoimmune disease\n* A viral infection (antinuclear antibodies from a virus are usually only in your blood for a short time)\n* Another health condition that can cause antinuclear antibodies, such as cancer\n\nIf your ANA test results are positive, your provider will likely order more tests to make a diagnosis.\n\n---\n\n**What is an ANA Test?**\n\nAn ANA test, also known as an antinuclear antibody test, is a blood test used to diagnose autoimmune disorders. The test measures the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in your blood.\n\n**Why Do I Need an ANA Test?**\n\nYour healthcare provider may order an ANA test if you have symptoms of an autoimmune disorder. These symptoms depend on what part of your body is affected and may include:\n\n* Joint pain or swelling\n* Skin rashes\n* Hair loss\n* Fatigue\n* Fever\n\n**What Happens During an ANA Test?**\n\nThe ANA test involves taking a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle. The blood will be collected into a test tube or vial, and you may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nSome medicines may affect the results of your ANA test. You may need to stop taking certain medicines before this test, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nResults from an ANA test alone cannot diagnose a specific disease. Your provider will use your ANA test results along with other blood and imaging tests, and information about your health to make a diagnosis.\n\n* A negative result means that antinuclear antibodies were not found in your blood, and you're less likely to have an autoimmune disorder.\n* A positive result may be a sign of:\n\t+ Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)\n\t+ A different type of autoimmune disease\n\t+ A viral infection (antinuclear antibodies from a virus are usually only in your blood for a short time)\n\t+ Another health condition that can cause antinuclear antibodies, such as cancer\n\nIf your ANA test results are positive, your provider will likely order more tests to make a diagnosis.\n\n**Having Antinuclear Antibodies in Your Blood Doesn't Always Mean You Have a Disease**\n\nSome healthy people have antinuclear antibodies in their blood, and levels tend to increase with age. Many healthy adults may have a positive ANA test result, especially women over the age of 65. Also, certain medicines can cause antinuclear antibodies.\n\nIf you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.\n\n---\n\n**ANA (Antinuclear Antibody) Test**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is an ANA test?**\n\nAn ANA test, also known as an antinuclear antibody test, is used to diagnose autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. It measures the presence of antinuclear antibodies in the blood.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is an ANA test performed?**\n\nThe ANA test is typically performed on a sample of blood drawn from a vein in the arm. The blood sample is then sent to a laboratory where it is tested for the presence of antinuclear antibodies.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the benefits and risks of an ANA test?**\n\nThe benefits of an ANA test include its ability to diagnose autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. However, there are also some risks associated with the test, including the possibility of false positive results.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How do I prepare for an ANA test?**\n\nThere is no special preparation needed for an ANA test. You should simply arrive at your appointment on time and be prepared to provide a blood sample.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the related health topics for an ANA test?**\n\nThe related health topics for an ANA test include autoimmune diseases, immune system and disorders, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and Sjogren's syndrome.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are the related medical tests for an ANA test?**\n\nThe related medical tests for an ANA test include antibody serology tests, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) test, C-reactive protein (CRP) test, CCP antibody test, celiac disease screening, cold stimulation test, complement blood test, immunoglobulins blood test, rheumatoid factor (RF) test, and smooth muscle antibody (SMA) test.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How do I cope with medical test anxiety?**\n\nIf you are experiencing anxiety about an upcoming medical test, there are several things you can do to help manage your stress. These include educating yourself about the test, preparing physically and emotionally for the test, and seeking support from friends and family.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How do I understand my lab results?**\n\nWhen it comes to understanding your lab results, it's essential to communicate with your healthcare provider.

    "content": "**ANK1 Gene**\n\nThe ANK1 gene provides instruction for making a protein called ankyrin-1. This protein is primarily active (expressed) in red blood cells, but it is also found in muscle and brain cells.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nIn red blood cells, ankyrin-1 is located at the cell membrane, where it attaches (binds) to other membrane proteins. The binding of membrane proteins to one another maintains the stability and structure of red blood cells but also allows for their flexibility. The proteins allow the cell to change shape without breaking when passing through narrow blood vessels.\n\nIn muscle and brain cells, ankyrin-1 performs similar functions, binding to other membrane proteins to play a role in cell stability, cell movement, and other cell functions.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nHereditary spherocytosis is a condition caused by mutations in the ANK1 gene. At least 55 mutations have been found to cause this condition. These mutations lead to the production of an ankyrin-1 protein that does not function normally and does not bind to other proteins within the red blood cell membrane. A lack of normal ankyrin-1 at the cell membrane also leads to a lack of another protein called spectrin because ankyrin-1 is not available to bind to spectrin. The shortage (deficiency) of these two proteins interferes with the structure and flexibility of the red blood cell membrane, causing red blood cells to be misshapen. These misshapen cells, called spherocytes, are removed from circulation and taken to the spleen for destruction. The shortage of red blood cells in circulation and the abundance of cells in the spleen are responsible for the signs and symptoms of hereditary spherocytosis.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* ankyrin 1\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* More about this health condition: Hereditary Spherocytosis\n\n---\n\n**Hereditary Spherocytosis and the ANK1 Gene**\n\n**What is Hereditary Spherocytosis?**\n\nHereditary spherocytosis is a genetic disorder characterized by the production of abnormal red blood cells. These cells are misshapen, known as spherocytes, due to a lack of normal ankyrin-1 protein at the cell membrane.\n\n**The ANK1 Gene and Ankyrin-1 Protein**\n\nThe ANK1 gene provides instructions for making the ankyrin-1 protein. Mutations in the ANK1 gene lead to the production of abnormal ankyrin-1 protein, which does not function normally. This abnormal protein fails to bind to other proteins within the red blood cell membrane, resulting in a shortage of spectrin and other essential proteins.\n\n**Consequences of ANK1 Gene Mutation**\n\nThe shortage of these two proteins interferes with the structure and flexibility of the red blood cell membrane. As a result, red blood cells are removed from circulation and taken to the spleen for destruction. This leads to a decrease in the number of red blood cells in circulation and an increase in the number of damaged cells in the spleen.\n\n**Other Names for the ANK1 Gene**\n\n* ANK\n* ANK-1\n* ANK1_HUMAN\n* ankyrin 1, erythrocytic ankyrin-1\n* ankyrin-R\n* erythrocyte ankyrin\n\n**Genomic Location of the ANK1 Gene**\n\nThe ANK1 gene is found on chromosome 8.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Genes and Gene Therapy\n* Genetic Disorders",
