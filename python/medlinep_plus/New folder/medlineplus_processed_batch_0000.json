    "content": "10 ways to cut 500 calories a day\n\t\n \n \n \n \n\nNo matter what type of diet you follow, to lose weight you need to burn more calories than you take in each day. For most people with overweight, cutting about 500 calories a day is a good place to start. If you can eat 500 fewer calories every day, you should lose about a pound (454 g) a week.\n\nAlways talk with your health care provider to determine a healthy weight for you before starting a weight-loss diet.\n\nHow to Cut Calories\n\nTry these 10 ways to cut 500 calories every day. It is easier than you may think.\n\nSwap your snack. Many people reach for a snack or two in between meals. Snacking is fine as long as you choose options that will fill up with fewer calories. The key is to have some healthy snacks ready when hunger hits. Instead of a 3-ounce (85 g) bag of flavored tortilla chips (425 calories), choose a cup (240 mL) of air-popped popcorn (31 calories), a cup (240 mL) of grapes and a low-fat cheese stick or a small apple and 12 almonds (80 calories). Choosing healthy snacks twice a day will easily save you 500 calories.\nCut one high-calorie treat. Try to remove one high-calorie food item each day. Whether it is a donut in the morning, a brownie or bag of chips at lunch, or chocolate cake after dinner, you will save 250 to 350 calories or more. To burn another 150 calories, take a 40-minute brisk walk after lunch or dinner.\nDo not drink your calories. One 12-ounce (355 mL) regular soda has about 150 calories, and a 16-ounce (475 mL) flavored latte can pack 250 calories or more. Even fruit smoothies have lots of calories, as many as 400 in a 16-ounce (475 mL) serving. A couple of sweet drinks a day can easily add up to 500 calories or more. Choose water, plain or flavored, sparkling water, or black coffee or tea instead and save your calories for foods that will help you feel full.\nSkip seconds. Taking a second helping can add up to unwanted calories. It is easy to keep filling your plate when you serve food family style on the table. Instead, fill your plate once and keep extras in the kitchen. Or, if you still do not feel satisfied, add a second helping of vegetables, fruit, or salad.\nMake low calorie substitutions. Substitute lower-calorie options for some of your high-calorie favorites. For example, if a recipe calls for a cup (240 mL) of sour cream (455 calories), use a cup (240 mL) of plain low-fat yogurt or Greek yogurt instead (220 calories).\nAsk for a doggie bag. The portions at many restaurants are much larger than recommended serving sizes. Instead of cleaning your whole plate, ask the server to put half in a container for you to take home for another meal. You can also share an entrée with a friend, or make a meal out of an appetizer and a large salad. Just be sure to go easy on the dressing and fried toppings.\nJust say \"no\" to fried food. Frying food can add lots of unhealthy calories and saturated fat to any dish. Instead of fried chicken or fish, choose grilled, broiled, or poached instead. And skip the French fries. A large serving of fries alone can add almost 500 calories to a meal. Instead, see if you can substitute for the vegetable of the day or a side salad.\nBuild a thinner pizza. Skip the meat toppings, extra cheese, and deep-dish crust, and have a couple slices of thin-crust vegetable pizza instead. You will save a little over 500 calories.\nUse a plate. Eat all food from a plate or bowl, including snacks. When you snack out of a bag or box, it is easy to eat more than you intend to. This is especially true if you are sitting in front of the TV. You may be surprised to learn that a large bag of chips could be more than 1000 calories. Instead, place one portion in a bowl, and put the rest away.\nAvoid alcohol. Cutting back on alcohol is an easy way for many people to trim calories. Alcohol does not have any nutritional value, so when you imbibe (drink) alcohol, you are getting empty calories, up to 500 for some mixed drinks made with syrupy sweeteners, fruit juices, and ice cream or heavy cream. If you do order a drink, choose a 12-ounce (355 mL) light beer (103 calories) or a 5-ounce (145 mL) glass of wine (120 calories).\nAlternative Names\n\nWeight loss - 500 calories; Overweight - 500 calories; Obesity - 500 calories; Diet - 500 calories\n\nReferences\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention website.

Among the more common features associated with this chromosomal change are distinctive facial features, mild to moderate intellectual disability, growth problems, and developmental delay. People with 10q26 deletion syndrome often have delayed development of speech and of motor skills such as sitting, crawling, and walking. Some have limited speech throughout life. Affected individuals may experience seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), poor impulse control (impulsivity), or exhibit autistic behaviors that affect communication and social interaction.\n\nA range of facial features is seen in people with 10q26 deletion syndrome, but not all affected individuals have these features. Facial features of people with 10q26 deletion syndrome may include a prominent or beaked nose, a broad nasal bridge, a small jaw (micrognathia), malformed ears that are low set, a thin upper lip, and an unusually small head size (microcephaly). Many affected individuals have widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism) that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). Some people with this condition have a short neck with extra folds of skin (webbed neck).\n\nLess common signs and symptoms can occur in 10q26 deletion syndrome. Skeletal problems include a spine that curves to the side (scoliosis), limited movement in the elbows or other joints, or curved fifth fingers and toes (clinodactyly). Slow growth before and after birth can also occur in affected individuals.

People with 10q26 deletion syndrome often have delayed development of speech and of motor skills such as sitting, crawling, and walking. Some have limited speech throughout life. Affected individuals may experience seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), poor impulse control (impulsivity), or exhibit autistic behaviors that affect communication and social interaction.\n\nA range of facial features is seen in people with 10q26 deletion syndrome, but not all affected individuals have these features. Facial features of people with 10q26 deletion syndrome may include a prominent or beaked nose, a broad nasal bridge, a small jaw (micrognathia), malformed ears that are low set, a thin upper lip, and an unusually small head size (microcephaly). Many affected individuals have widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism) that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). Some people with this condition have a short neck with extra folds of skin (webbed neck).\n\nLess common signs and symptoms can occur in 10q26 deletion syndrome. Skeletal problems include a spine that curves to the side (scoliosis), limited movement in the elbows or other joints, or curved fifth fingers and toes (clinodactyly). Slow growth before and after birth can also occur in affected individuals. Males with this condition may have genital abnormalities, such as a small penis (micropenis), undescended testes (cryptorchidism), or the urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias). Some people with 10q26 deletion syndrome have kidney abnormalities, heart defects, breathing problems, recurrent infections, or hearing or vision problems.\n10q26 deletion syndrome is a condition that results from the loss (deletion) of a small piece of chromosome 10 in each cell.

    "content": "12 healthy snacks with 200 calories or less\n\t\n \n \n \n \n\nSnacks are small, quick mini-meals. Snacks are eaten between meals and help keep you from being hungry. Including a protein source (such as nuts, beans, or low-fat or fat-free dairy) or a whole grain (such as whole wheat bread) can give snacks more \"staying power\" so you will not get hungry again as quickly. Healthy snacks are:\n\nWhole grain\nLow-salt\nLow in added sugar\nFresh foods like fruits and vegetables\nSnacks List\n\nHere are a dozen healthy snack ideas you can try:\n\nOne medium apple or pear with 12 almonds\nHalf cup (120 milliliters, mL) of berries with 6 ounces (oz), or 170 grams (g), of plain yogurt or low-fat cottage cheese\nOne small banana with 1 tablespoon (tbsp), or (15 mL), unsalted peanut butter or almond butter\nOne quarter cup (60 mL) trail mix with dried fruits and nuts (with no added sugar or salt)\nThree cups (720 mL) air popped popcorn with 2 tbsp (30 mL) shredded parmesan cheese\nOne cup (240 mL) of grapes or cherry tomatoes with one low-fat string cheese\nOne cup (240 mL) raw carrots, broccoli, or bell peppers with 2 tbsp (30 mL) of hummus or black bean dip\nOne cup (240 mL) tomato soup with five whole grain crackers\nOne third cup (80 mL) rolled oats cooked in 1 cup (240 mL) fat-free milk with cinnamon\nA hard-boiled egg and 12 almonds\nFruit smoothie with 1 cup (240 mL) fat-free milk, half a small banana, and half cup (120 mL) berries\nFive whole wheat crackers and 1 oz (30 g) low-fat cheddar cheese\nWhy Snacks can be Good for you\n\nSnacks can be good for you, as long as you include healthy choices and amounts. For example, you can put the desired amount of food on a plate rather than eating directly from the bag. Small snacks between meals can keep you from overeating at mealtimes and help you manage your weight. If you have diabetes, a balanced snack can help stabilize your blood sugar. Just be sure you count the grams of carbohydrates.\n\nHealthy snacks for adults can provide energy for work and exercise. Healthy snacks and drinks for children provide much needed energy for growth, school, and sports. Offer young children healthy snacks, and they may be more likely to choose them on their own as they get older.\n\nEating a variety of snacks like the ones above will give you extra vitamins, minerals, fiber, antioxidants (substances that help prevent cell damage), and other disease-fighting nutrients.\n\nLimit high-calorie sports drinks and packaged, processed snacks, likes chips or cookies. Include a glass of water with your snack instead of a sweetened beverage. Avoid snacks with added sugar to help you maintain healthy teeth and gums.\n\nAlternative Names\n\nNibbles; Appetizers; Healthy eating - healthy snacks; Weight loss - healthy snacks; Healthy diet - healthy snacks; Wellness - healthy snacks\n\nReferences\n\nAmerican Diabetes Association website. 25 simple snack ideas. www.diabetesfoodhub.org/articles/25-simple-snack-ideas.html.

For example, you can put the desired amount of food on a plate rather than eating directly from the bag. Small snacks between meals can keep you from overeating at mealtimes and help you manage your weight. If you have diabetes, a balanced snack can help stabilize your blood sugar.

The duplication occurs near the middle of the chromosome at a location designated p11.2. This duplication can have a variety of effects. Common characteristics that occur in people with a 16p11.2 duplication include a low weight; a small head size (microcephaly); and developmental delay, especially in speech and language. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of behavioral problems. However, some people with the duplication have no identified physical or behavioral abnormalities.\n\nDevelopmental delay and intellectual disability can occur in people with a 16p11.2 duplication. Approximately one-third of children with this condition have delays in developing physical skills such as sitting, crawling, or walking. The average IQ of affected individuals is about 26 points lower than that of their parents without the duplication. About 80 percent of people with a 16p11.2 duplication have problems related to speech or language. Both expressive language skills (vocabulary and the production of speech) and receptive language skills (the ability to understand speech) can be affected.\n\nOne of the most common behavioral problems associated with this chromosomal change is attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Autism spectrum disorder, which affects communication and social skills, is diagnosed in about one in five people with a 16p11.2 duplication. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of mental health problems, including schizophrenia, anxiety, and depression. Recurrent seizures are possible in this condition, although they do not occur in most affected individuals.\n\nOther abnormalities that can occur with a 16p11.2 duplication include malformations of the kidneys and urinary tract. However, there is no particular pattern of physical abnormalities that characterizes 16p11.2 duplications; signs and symptoms related to the chromosomal change vary even among affected members of the same family.\n\nFrequency\n\t\nExpand Section\nCauses\n\t\nExpand Section\nInheritance\n\t\nExpand Section\nOther Names for This Condition\n\t\nExpand Section\nAdditional Information & Resources\n\t\nExpand Section\nReferences\n\t\nExpand Section\nDescription\n\t\nCollapse Section\n\n16p11.2 duplication is a chromosomal change in which a small amount of genetic material within chromosome 16 is abnormally copied (duplicated).

    "content": "17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency\n17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency\nDescription\n\t\nCollapse Section\n\n17 alpha(α)-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency is a condition that affects the function of certain hormone-producing glands called the gonads (ovaries in females and testes in males) and the adrenal glands. The gonads direct sexual development before birth and during puberty and are important for reproduction. The adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys, regulate the production of certain hormones, including those that control salt levels in the body. People with 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency have an imbalance of many of the hormones that are made in these glands. 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency is one of a group of disorders, known as congenital adrenal hyperplasias, that impair hormone production and disrupt sexual development and maturation.\n\nHormone imbalances lead to the characteristic signs and symptoms of 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency, which include high blood pressure (hypertension), low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia), and abnormal sexual development. The severity of the features varies. Two forms of the condition are recognized: complete 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency, which is more severe, and partial 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency, which is typically less so.\n\nMales and females are affected by disruptions to sexual development differently. Females (who have two X chromosomes) with 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency are born with normal external female genitalia; however, the internal reproductive organs, including the uterus and ovaries, may be underdeveloped. Women with complete 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency do not develop secondary sex characteristics, such as breasts and pubic hair, and do not menstruate (amenorrhea). Women with partial 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency may develop some secondary sex characteristics; menstruation is typically irregular or absent. Either form of the disorder results in an inability to conceive a baby (infertility).\n\nIn affected individuals who are chromosomally male (having an X and a Y chromosome), problems with sexual development lead to abnormalities of the external genitalia. The most severely affected are born with characteristically female external genitalia and are generally raised as females. However, because they do not have female internal reproductive organs, these individuals have amenorrhea and do not develop female secondary sex characteristics. These individuals have testes, but they are abnormally located in the abdomen (undescended). Sometimes, complete 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency leads to external genitalia that do not look clearly male or clearly female. Males with partial 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency may have a small penis (micropenis), the opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis (hypospadias), or a scrotum divided into two lobes (bifid scrotum). Males with either complete or partial 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency are also infertile.\n\nFrequency\n\t\nExpand Section\nCauses\n\t\nExpand Section\nInheritance\n\t\nExpand Section\nOther Names for This Condition\n\t\nExpand Section\nAdditional Information & Resources\n\t\nExpand Section\nReferences\n\t\nExpand Section\nDescription\n\t\nCollapse Section\n\n17 alpha(α)-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency is a condition that affects the function of certain hormone-producing glands called the gonads (ovaries in females and testes in males) and the adrenal glands.

Sometimes, complete 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency leads to external genitalia that do not look clearly male or clearly female. Males with partial 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency may have a small penis (micropenis), the opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis (hypospadias), or a scrotum divided into two lobes (bifid scrotum).\n\n---\n\n7α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency may have a small penis (micropenis), the opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis (hypospadias), or a scrotum divided into two lobes (bifid scrotum).

The protein produced from this gene is involved in the formation of steroid hormones. This group of hormones includes sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen, which are needed for normal sexual development and reproduction; mineralocorticoids, which help regulate the body's salt and water balance; and glucocorticoids, which are involved in maintaining blood sugar (glucose) levels and regulating the body's response to stress.Steroid hormones are produced through a series of chemical reactions. The CYP17A1 enzyme performs two important reactions in this process. The enzyme has 17 alpha(α)-hydroxylase activity, which is important for production of glucocorticoids and sex hormones. CYP17A1 also has 17,20-lyase activity, which is integral to the production of sex hormones.17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency results from a shortage (deficiency) of both enzyme activities. The amount of remaining enzyme activity determines whether a person will have the complete or partial form of the disorder. Individuals with the complete form have CYP17A1 gene mutations that result in the production of an enzyme with very little or no 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activity. People with the partial form of this condition have CYP17A1 gene mutations that allow some enzyme activity, although at reduced levels.With little or no 17α-hydroxylase activity, production of glucocorticoids is impaired, and instead, mineralocorticoids are produced. An excess of these salt-regulating hormones leads to hypertension and hypokalemia.Loss of 17,20-lyase activity impairs sex hormone production. Shortage of these hormones disrupts development of the reproductive system and impairs the onset of puberty in males and females with 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency.\n\n\n\n      \n        Learn more about the gene associated with 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiencyExpand Section\n      \n      \n          \n            CYP17A1\n17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency is caused by mutations in the CYP17A1 gene.

    "content": "17-Hydroxyprogesterone\n17-Hydroxyprogesterone\nWhat is a 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) test?\n\nThis test measures the amount of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) in a sample of your blood. 17-OHP is a substance that your adrenal glands make.\n\nYour adrenal glands are two small organs that sit on top of each kidney. They make different types of hormones you need to stay alive and healthy. Hormones are chemical messengers in your bloodstream that control the actions of certain cells or organs.\n\nNormally, your adrenal glands use 17-OHP to make a hormone called cortisol. Cortisol helps control your energy levels, blood glucose (sugar), blood pressure, and your body's response to stress, illness and injury.\n\nA 17-OHP test helps diagnose a group of uncommon, inherited genetic disorders that affect how well your adrenal glands make cortisol. These genetic adrenal gland disorders are called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).\n\nPeople with CAH have a change in a gene that causes the lack of an enzyme that your adrenal glands need to make hormones. The most common type of CAH is caused by a lack of an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase. 21-hydroxylase helps your adrenal glands use 17-OHP to make cortisol.\n\nWithout enough 21-hydroxylase, the adrenal glands struggle to make enough cortisol. As the adrenal glands work harder to do their job, they become enlarged and make abnormally high levels of 17-OHP. These high levels of 17-OHP are a sign of CAH with 21-hydroxylase deficiency.\n\nThe adrenal glands use the extra 17-OHP to make larger than normal amounts of male sex hormones. This happens in children and adults of both sexes. So, tests for male hormones, including testosterone, are often used with 17-OHP tests to help diagnose CAH.\n\nThe symptoms of CAH depend on how much cortisol the adrenal glands are able to make. CAH is often organized into two groups based on how severe the symptoms are:\n\nClassic CAH includes the most severe forms of the disorder. It's usually diagnosed at birth. Without diagnosis and treatment, severe CAH can be life-threatening. Serious symptoms may show up shortly after birth. They may include:\n\nDehydration\nLow blood pressure\nAn irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)\nShock\n\n\n\nNewborn girls with severe CAH may have external genitals that are not clearly female or male. This is caused by high levels of male hormones. In newborn boys, the genitals usually appear normal, but sometimes the penis may be larger than usual.\n\nClassic CAH that is caused by a 21-hydroxylase deficiency can be diagnosed with 17-OHP testing. Less often, CAH is caused by a lack of a different enzyme.\n\nNonclassic CAH includes mild forms of the disorder. It's also called late-onset CAH because symptoms show up between early childhood and early adulthood. It is almost always caused by a lack of 21-hydroxylase and can be found with a 17-OHP test.\n\nTreatment is only needed if a person has symptoms. The symptoms depend on the person's age and sex. For example:\n\nChildren may have signs of early puberty, which means having signs of sexual development before age 8 in girls and before age 9 in boys.\nTeenage girls and women may have more facial and body hair than usual and/or a deep voice.\nAdults may have infertility.\n\nOther names: 17-OH progesterone, 17-OHP, 17 alphahydroxyprogesterone, 17 hydroxy progesterone: serum, progesterone: 17-hydroxy\n\nWhat is it used for?\n\nA 17-OHP test is used to help find and monitor the most common type of CAH, which is sometimes called 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The test is used to:\n\nCheck all newborns for severe CAH (classic CAH). Newborn screening tests can't check for mild CAH (nonclassic).\nHelp diagnose mild CAH in children, teens, and adults who have symptoms that could be caused by the disorder.\nFind out if treatment for CAH is working.\nHelp rule out CAH in women who have certain symptoms such as large amounts of facial hair and irregular menstrual periods. These symptoms can also be caused by other conditions, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).\nWhy do I need a 17-OHP test?\n\nBabies need a 17-OHP test as part of routine newborn screening tests to check for severe CAH:\n\nIf you give birth in a hospital , your baby will usually have a 17-OHP test before going home. The test is most accurate when it's done more than 24 hours after birth. If your baby is tested sooner, ask your child's provider if a second test should be done at a later time. Some states require two tests for all babies.\nIf you give birth at home, make sure your baby has all the necessary screening tests.\n\nSymptoms of severe CAH usually begin within days or weeks after birth, but in certain cases, they may not show up until early childhood. These symptoms may be serious and include:\n\nLack of energy\nVomiting and other feeding problems\nDiarrhea\nDehydration\nFailure to thrive (not gaining weight and growing as expected)\n\nChildren, teens, and adults may need testing if they develop symptoms of mild CAH (nonclassic CAH):\n\nIn children and teens, symptoms of mild CAH may include:\n\nRapid growth that stops at a younger age than usual. As a result, older teens and adults with CAH may be shorter than average.\nSigns of early puberty.\nSevere acne, which may continue into adulthood.\n\nIn girls and women, symptoms of mild CAH may include:\n\nMore facial and/or body hair than usual\nIrregular menstrual periods or no periods at all\nThinning hair on the head, especially near the temples (male pattern baldness)\nEnlarged clitoris\nInfertility\n\nIn boys and men, symptoms of mild CAH may include:\n\nEnlarged penis with small testicles (testes)\nLow sperm count\nInfertility\nWhat happens during a 17-OHP test?\n\nFor a newborn screening, a health care professional will clean your baby's heel with alcohol. Then the provider will stick the baby's heel with a small needle to collect a few drops of blood. The heel will then be bandaged.\n\nFor older children and adults, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\nWill I need to do anything to prepare for the test?\n\nThere are no special preparations needed for a 17-OHP test.\n\nAre there any risks to the test?\n\nThere is very little risk from a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. Your baby may feel a little pinch when the heel is poked. A small bruise may form on the heel, but it should go away quickly.\n\nWhat do the results mean?\n\nThe results of a 17-OHP test help show whether you or your child have the most common type of CAH, which is caused by a lack of 21-hydroxylase.\n\nIf test results show a normal amount of 17-OHP, it means that you or your child probably do not have CAH with 21-hydroxylase deficiency. If you or your child has symptoms, the provider may order other tests to figure out the cause.\n\nIf test results show higher than normal levels of 17-OHP, you or your child probably has CAH. The provider may order other tests to learn more about how CAH is affecting you or your child.\n\nIf you or your child is being treated for CAH, decreasing levels of 17-OHP over time means that the treatment is working. Treatment for CAH may include medicines to replace the cortisol your body can't make. Other medicines may also be needed, depending on the type of CAH. If a girl is born with atypical external genitals, surgery may also be done.\n\nIf you, your child, or another family member has been diagnosed with CAH, you may want to talk with a genetic counselor. Genetic counselors are trained in genetics and genetic testing. They can help you learn how likely you are to pass CAH to future children.\n\nIf you have questions about the results of a 17-OHP test, talk with your provider.\n\n---\n\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\n\nIs there anything else I need to know about a 17-OHP test?\n\nIf the results of your 17-OHP test aren't clear, your provider may order another test to measure your 17-OHP. This is called an ACTH stimulation test. It involves measuring your cortisol and 17-OHP levels before and after you have an injection (shot) of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone).\n\nACTH is a hormone your body makes to trigger your adrenal glands to make cortisol. If you have CAH, the ACTH injection will make your 17-OHP levels increase a lot, but it will not increase your cortisol levels.\n\nShow references\nWhat is a 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) test?\n\nThis test measures the amount of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) in a sample of your blood. 17-OHP is a substance that your adrenal glands make.\n\nYour adrenal glands are two small organs that sit on top of each kidney.

Less often, CAH is caused by a lack of a different enzyme.\nNonclassic CAH includes mild forms of the disorder. It's also called late-onset CAH because symptoms show up between early childhood and early adulthood. It is almost always caused by a lack of 21-hydroxylase and can be found with a 17-OHP test.\nTreatment is only needed if a person has symptoms. The symptoms depend on the person's age and sex. For example:\nOther names: 17-OH progesterone, 17-OHP, 17 alphahydroxyprogesterone, 17 hydroxy progesterone: serum, progesterone: 17-hydroxy\nWhat is it used for?\n\nA 17-OHP test is used to help find and monitor the most common type of CAH, which is sometimes called 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The test is used to:\n\nCheck all newborns for severe CAH (classic CAH). Newborn screening tests can't check for mild CAH (nonclassic).\nHelp diagnose mild CAH in children, teens, and adults who have symptoms that could be caused by the disorder.\nFind out if treatment for CAH is working.\nHelp rule out CAH in women who have certain symptoms such as large amounts of facial hair and irregular menstrual periods. These symptoms can also be caused by other conditions, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).\nA 17-OHP test is used to help find and monitor the most common type of CAH, which is sometimes called 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The test is used to:\nWhy do I need a 17-OHP test?\n\nBabies need a 17-OHP test as part of routine newborn screening tests to check for severe CAH:\n\n---\n\nwhich is sometimes called 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The test is used to:\nWhy do I need a 17-OHP test?\n\nBabies need a 17-OHP test as part of routine newborn screening tests to check for severe CAH:\n\nIf you give birth in a hospital , your baby will usually have a 17-OHP test before going home. The test is most accurate when it's done more than 24 hours after birth. If your baby is tested sooner, ask your child's provider if a second test should be done at a later time. Some states require two tests for all babies.\nIf you give birth at home, make sure your baby has all the necessary screening tests.\n\nSymptoms of severe CAH usually begin within days or weeks after birth, but in certain cases, they may not show up until early childhood. These symptoms may be serious and include:\n\nLack of energy\nVomiting and other feeding problems\nDiarrhea\nDehydration\nFailure to thrive (not gaining weight and growing as expected)\n\nChildren, teens, and adults may need testing if they develop symptoms of mild CAH (nonclassic CAH):\n\nIn children and teens, symptoms of mild CAH may include:\n\nRapid growth that stops at a younger age than usual. As a result, older teens and adults with CAH may be shorter than average.\nSigns of early puberty.\nSevere acne, which may continue into adulthood.\n\nIn girls and women, symptoms of mild CAH may include:\n\nMore facial and/or body hair than usual\nIrregular menstrual periods or no periods at all\nThinning hair on the head, especially near the temples (male pattern baldness)\nEnlarged clitoris\nInfertility\n\nIn boys and men, symptoms of mild CAH may include:\n\nEnlarged penis with small testicles (testes)\nLow sperm count\nInfertility\nBabies need a 17-OHP test as part of routine newborn screening tests to check for severe CAH:\nSymptoms of severe CAH usually begin within days or weeks after birth, but in certain cases, they may not show up until early childhood.

Then the provider will stick the baby's heel with a small needle to collect a few drops of blood. The heel will then be bandaged.\n\nFor older children and adults, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\nFor a newborn screening, a health care professional will clean your baby's heel with alcohol.

You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. Your baby may feel a little pinch when the heel is poked. A small bruise may form on the heel, but it should go away quickly.\nThere is very little risk from a blood test.

A small bruise may form on the heel, but it should go away quickly.\nWhat do the results mean?\n\nThe results of a 17-OHP test help show whether you or your child have the most common type of CAH, which is caused by a lack of 21-hydroxylase.\n\nIf test results show a normal amount of 17-OHP, it means that you or your child probably do not have CAH with 21-hydroxylase deficiency. If you or your child has symptoms, the provider may order other tests to figure out the cause.\n\nIf test results show higher than normal levels of 17-OHP, you or your child probably has CAH. The provider may order other tests to learn more about how CAH is affecting you or your child.\n\nIf you or your child is being treated for CAH, decreasing levels of 17-OHP over time means that the treatment is working. Treatment for CAH may include medicines to replace the cortisol your body can't make. Other medicines may also be needed, depending on the type of CAH. If a girl is born with atypical external genitals, surgery may also be done.\n\nIf you, your child, or another family member has been diagnosed with CAH, you may want to talk with a genetic counselor. Genetic counselors are trained in genetics and genetic testing. They can help you learn how likely you are to pass CAH to future children.\n\nIf you have questions about the results of a 17-OHP test, talk with your provider.\n\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\nThe results of a 17-OHP test help show whether you or your child have the most common type of CAH, which is caused by a lack of 21-hydroxylase.\nIf test results show a normal amount of 17-OHP, it means that you or your child probably do not have CAH with 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

This is called an ACTH stimulation test. It involves measuring your cortisol and 17-OHP levels before and after you have an injection (shot) of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone).\n\nACTH is a hormone your body makes to trigger your adrenal glands to make cortisol.

    "content": "17-OH progesterone\n\t\n \n \n \n \n\n17-OH progesterone is a blood test that measures the amount of 17-OH progesterone in the blood. This is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands and sex glands.\n\nHow the Test is Performed\n\nA blood sample is needed. Most of the time, blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\n\nIn infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin.\n\nThe blood collects in a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip.\nA bandage is put over the spot to stop any bleeding.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\n\nMany medicines can interfere with blood test results.\n\nYour health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test.\nDo not stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.\nHow the Test will Feel\n\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\n\nWhy the Test is Performed\n\nThe main use of this test is to check infants for an inherited disorder that affects the adrenal gland, called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). It is often done on infants who are born with outer genitals that do not clearly look like those of a boy or a girl.\n\nThis test is also used to identify people who develop symptoms of CAH later in life, a condition called nonclassical adrenal hyperplasia.\n\nA provider may recommend this test for women or girls who have male traits such as:\n\nExcess hair growth in places where adult men grow hair\nDeep voice or an increase in muscle mass\nAbsence of menses\nInfertility\nNormal Results\n\nNormal and abnormal values differ for babies born with low birth weight. In general, normal results are as follows:\n\nBabies more than 24 hours old - less than 400 to 600 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL) or 12.12 to 18.18 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L)\nChildren before puberty around 100 ng/dL or 3.03 nmol/L\nAdults - less than 200 ng/dL or 6.06 nmol/L\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\nThe examples above show the common measurements for results of these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.\n\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\n\nA high level of 17-OH progesterone may be due to:\n\nTumors of the adrenal gland\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)\n\nIn infants with CAH, the 17-OHP level ranges from 2,000 to 40,000 ng/dL or 60.6 to 1212 nmol/L. In adults, a level greater than 200 ng/dL or 6.06 nmol/L may be due to nonclassical adrenal hyperplasia.\n\nConsiderations\n\nYour provider may suggest an ACTH test if 17-OH progesterone level is between 200 to 800 ng/dL or 6.06 to 24.24 nmol/L.\n\nAlternative Names\n\n17-hydroxyprogesterone; Progesterone - 17-OH\n\nReferences\n\nChan Y-M, Hannema SE, Achermann JC, Hughes IA.

You will need to collect your urine over 24 hours. Your health care provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly.\n\nHow to Prepare for the Test\n\nYour provider will instruct you, if necessary, to stop medicines that may interfere with the test. These may include:\n\nBirth control pills that contain estrogen\nCertain antibiotics\nGlucocorticoids\nHow the Test will Feel\n\nThe test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.\n\nWhy the Test is Performed\n\n17-OHCS is a product formed when the liver and other body tissues break down the steroid hormone cortisol.\n\nThis test can help determine if the body is producing too much cortisol. The test may be used to diagnose Cushing syndrome. This is a disorder that occurs when the body has a constant high level of cortisol.\n\nThe urine volume and urine creatinine are often done with 17-OHCS test at the same time. This helps the provider interpret the test.\n\nThis test is not done often now.

Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\n\nA higher than normal level of 17-OHCS may indicate:\n\nA type of Cushing syndrome caused by a tumor in the adrenal gland that produces cortisol\nDepression\nHydrocortisone therapy\nMalnutrition\nObesity\nPregnancy\nA hormonal cause of severe high blood pressure\nSevere physical or emotional stress\nTumor in the pituitary gland or elsewhere in the body that releases a hormone called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)\n\nA lower than normal level of 17-OHCS may indicate:\n\nAdrenal glands are not producing enough of their hormones\nPituitary gland is not producing enough of its hormones\nHereditary enzyme deficiency\nPrevious surgery to remove the adrenal gland\nAn expected result if part of a standard three- day dexamethasone suppression test\n\n\nUrinating more than 3 liters a day (polyuria) can make the result of the test high even though cortisol production is normal.\n\nRisks\n\nThere are no risks with this test.\n\nAlternative Names\n\n17-OH corticosteroids; 17-OHCS\n\nReferences\n\nNewell-Price JDC, Auchus RJ.

The adrenal glands are located on top of the kidneys and produce a variety of hormones that regulate many essential functions in the body. In people with 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the adrenal glands produce excess androgens, which are male sex hormones.\n\nThere are three types of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Two types are classic forms, known as the salt-wasting and simple virilizing types. The third type is called the non-classic type. The salt-wasting type is the most severe, the simple virilizing type is less severe, and the non-classic type is the least severe form.\n\nMales and females with either classic form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency tend to have an early growth spurt, but their final adult height is usually shorter than others in their family. Additionally, affected individuals may have a reduced ability to have biological children (decreased fertility). Females may also develop excessive body hair growth (hirsutism), male pattern baldness, and irregular menstruation.\n\nApproximately 75 percent of individuals with classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency have the salt-wasting type. Hormone production is extremely low in this form of the disorder. Affected individuals lose large amounts of sodium in their urine, which can be life-threatening in early infancy. Babies with the salt-wasting type can experience poor feeding, weight loss, dehydration, and vomiting. Individuals with the simple virilizing form do not experience salt loss.\n\nIn both the salt-wasting and simple virilizing forms of this disorder, females typically have external genitalia that do not look clearly male or female. Males usually have male-typical genitalia but the testes may be small.\n\nFemales with the non-classic type of 21-hydroxylase deficiency have female-typical genitalia. As affected females get older, they may experience hirsutism, male pattern baldness, irregular menstruation, and decreased fertility.

The CYP21A2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase.  This enzyme is found in the adrenal glands, where it plays a role in producing hormones called cortisol and aldosterone. Cortisol has numerous functions, such as maintaining blood sugar (glucose) levels, protecting the body from stress, and suppressing inflammation. Aldosterone is sometimes called the salt-retaining hormone because it regulates the amount of salt retained by the kidneys. The retention of salt affects fluid levels in the body and blood pressure.21-hydroxylase deficiency is caused by a shortage (deficiency) of the 21-hydroxylase enzyme. When 21-hydroxylase is lacking, substances that are usually used to form cortisol and aldosterone instead build up in the adrenal glands and are converted to androgens.  The excess production of androgens leads to abnormalities of sexual development in people with 21-hydroxylase deficiency. A lack of aldosterone production contributes to the salt loss in people with the salt-wasting form of this condition.The amount of functional 21-hydroxylase enzyme determines the severity of the disorder. Individuals with the salt-wasting type have CYP21A2 mutations that result in a completely nonfunctional enzyme. People with the simple virilizing type of this condition have CYP21A2 gene mutations that allow the production of low levels of functional enzyme. Individuals with the non-classic type of this disorder have CYP21A2 mutations that result in the production of reduced amounts of the enzyme, but more enzyme than either of the other types.\n\n---\n\nnzyme.

The adrenal glands are located on top of the kidneys and produce a variety of hormones that regulate many essential functions in the body. In people with 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the adrenal glands produce excess androgens, which are male sex hormones.\n\nThere are three types of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Two types are classic forms, known as the salt-wasting and simple virilizing types. The third type is called the non-classic type. The salt-wasting type is the most severe, the simple virilizing type is less severe, and the non-classic type is the least severe form.\n\nMales and females with either classic form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency tend to have an early growth spurt, but their final adult height is usually shorter than others in their family. Additionally, affected individuals may have a reduced ability to have biological children (decreased fertility). Females may also develop excessive body hair growth (hirsutism), male pattern baldness, and irregular menstruation.\n\nApproximately 75 percent of individuals with classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency have the salt-wasting type. Hormone production is extremely low in this form of the disorder. Affected individuals lose large amounts of sodium in their urine, which can be life-threatening in early infancy. Babies with the salt-wasting type can experience poor feeding, weight loss, dehydration, and vomiting. Individuals with the simple virilizing form do not experience salt loss.\n\nIn both the salt-wasting and simple virilizing forms of this disorder, females typically have external genitalia that do not look clearly male or female. Males usually have male-typical genitalia but the testes may be small.\n\nFemales with the non-classic type of 21-hydroxylase deficiency have female-typical genitalia. As affected females get older, they may experience hirsutism, male pattern baldness, irregular menstruation, and decreased fertility. Males with the non-classic type may have early beard growth and small testes.

The CYP21A2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase.  This enzyme is found in the adrenal glands, where it plays a role in producing hormones called cortisol and aldosterone. Cortisol has numerous functions, such as maintaining blood sugar (glucose) levels, protecting the body from stress, and suppressing inflammation. Aldosterone is sometimes called the salt-retaining hormone because it regulates the amount of salt retained by the kidneys. The retention of salt affects fluid levels in the body and blood pressure.21-hydroxylase deficiency is caused by a shortage (deficiency) of the 21-hydroxylase enzyme. When 21-hydroxylase is lacking, substances that are usually used to form cortisol and aldosterone instead build up in the adrenal glands and are converted to androgens.  The excess production of androgens leads to abnormalities of sexual development in people with 21-hydroxylase deficiency. A lack of aldosterone production contributes to the salt loss in people with the salt-wasting form of this condition.The amount of functional 21-hydroxylase enzyme determines the severity of the disorder. Individuals with the salt-wasting type have CYP21A2 mutations that result in a completely nonfunctional enzyme. People with the simple virilizing type of this condition have CYP21A2 gene mutations that allow the production of low levels of functional enzyme. Individuals with the non-classic type of this disorder have CYP21A2 mutations that result in the production of reduced amounts of the enzyme, but more enzyme than either of the other types.\n\n---\n\nnzyme.

The deletion occurs near the middle of the chromosome at a location designated q11.2.\n\n22q11.2 deletion syndrome has many possible signs and symptoms that can affect almost any part of the body. The features of this syndrome vary widely, even among affected members of the same family. People with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome commonly have heart abnormalities that are often present from birth, recurrent infections caused by problems with the immune system, and distinctive facial features. In affected individuals, the muscles that form the roof of the mouth (palate) may not close completely, even though the tissue covering them does, resulting in a condition called submucosal cleft palate. The abnormal palate is often highly arched and there may be a split in the soft flap of tissue that hangs from the back of the mouth (bifid uvula). Submucosal cleft palate can also interfere with normal speech by causing air to come out of the nose during speech, leading to nasal-sounding speech. Affected individuals may also have breathing problems, kidney abnormalities, low levels of calcium in the blood (which can result in seizures), a decrease in blood platelets (thrombocytopenia), significant feeding difficulties, gastrointestinal problems, and hearing loss. Skeletal differences are possible, including mild short stature and, less frequently, abnormalities of the spinal bones.\n\nMany children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome have developmental delays, including delayed growth and speech development, and some have mild intellectual disability or learning disabilities. Older affected individuals have difficulty reading, performing tasks involving math, and problem solving. Children with this condition often need help changing and adapting their behaviors when responding to situations. Additionally, affected children are more likely than children without 22q11.2 deletion syndrome to have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and developmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorder that affect communication and social interaction.\n\nBecause the signs and symptoms of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are so varied, different groupings of features were once described as separate conditions. Doctors named these conditions DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome (also called Shprintzen syndrome), and conotruncal anomaly face syndrome. In addition, some children with the 22q11.2 deletion were diagnosed with the autosomal dominant form of Opitz G/BBB syndrome and Cayler cardiofacial syndrome. Once the genetic basis for these disorders was identified, doctors determined that they were all part of a single syndrome with many possible signs and symptoms. To avoid confusion, this condition is usually called 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, a description based on its underlying genetic cause.\n\nFrequency\n\t\nExpand Section\nCauses\n\t\nExpand Section\nInheritance\n\t\nExpand Section\nOther Names for This Condition\n\t\nExpand Section\nAdditional Information & Resources\n\t\nExpand Section\nReferences\n\t\nExpand Section\nDescription\n\t\nCollapse Section\n\n22q11.2 deletion syndrome (which is also known by several other names, listed below) is a disorder caused by the deletion of a small piece of chromosome 22.

This region contains 30 to 40 genes, many of which have not been well characterized. A small percentage of affected individuals have shorter deletions in the same region. This condition is described as a contiguous gene deletion syndrome because it results from the loss of many genes that are close together.Researchers are working to identify all of the genes that contribute to the features of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. They have determined that the loss of a particular gene on chromosome 22, TBX1, is probably responsible for many of the syndrome's characteristic signs (such as heart defects, a cleft palate, distinctive facial features, hearing loss, and low calcium levels). Some studies suggest that a deletion of this gene may contribute to behavioral problems as well. The loss of another gene, COMT, in the same region of chromosome 22 may also help explain the increased risk of behavioral problems and mental illness. The loss of additional genes in the deleted region likely contributes to the varied features of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.\n\n\n\n      \n        Learn more about the genes and chromosome associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndromeExpand Section\n      \n      \n          \n            COMT\n            \n          \n            TBX1\n            \n          \n            chromosome 22\nMost people with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are missing a sequence of about 3 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) on one copy of chromosome 22 in each cell.

They have determined that the loss of a particular gene on chromosome 22, TBX1, is probably responsible for many of the syndrome's characteristic signs (such as heart defects, a cleft palate, distinctive facial features, hearing loss, and low calcium levels). Some studies suggest that a deletion of this gene may contribute to behavioral problems as well. The loss of another gene, COMT, in the same region of chromosome 22 may also help explain the increased risk of behavioral problems and mental illness. The loss of additional genes in the deleted region likely contributes to the varied features of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.\nMost people with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are missing a sequence of about 3 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) on one copy of chromosome 22 in each cell.

Most cases of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are not inherited, however. The deletion occurs most often as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development. Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family, though they can pass the condition to their children. In about 10 percent of cases, a person with this condition inherits the deletion in chromosome 22 from a parent. In inherited cases, other family members may be affected as well.\nThe inheritance of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is considered autosomal dominant because a deletion in one copy of chromosome 22 in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition.

    "content": "24-hour urinary aldosterone excretion test\n\t\n \n \n \n \n\nThe 24-hour urinary aldosterone excretion test measures the amount of aldosterone removed in the urine in a day.\n\nAldosterone can also be measured with a blood test.\n\nHow the Test is Performed\n\nA 24-hour urine sample is needed. You will need to collect your urine over 24 hours. Your health care provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly.\n\nHow to Prepare for the Test\n\nYour provider may ask you to stop taking certain medicines a few days before the test so that they don't affect the test results. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take. These include:\n\nHigh blood pressure medicines\nHeart medicines\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nAntacid and ulcer medicines\nWater pills (diuretics)\n\nDo not stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.\n\nBe aware that other factors can affect aldosterone measurements, including:\n\nPregnancy\nHigh- or low-sodium diet\nHigh- or low-potassium diet\nEating large amounts of black licorice\nStrenuous exercise\nStress\n\nDo not drink coffee, tea, or cola during the day the urine is collected. Your provider will likely recommend that you eat no more than 3 grams of salt (sodium) per day for at least 2 weeks before the test.\n\nHow the Test will Feel\n\nThe test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.\n\nWhy the Test is Performed\n\nThe test is done to see how much aldosterone is released into your urine. Aldosterone is a hormone released by the adrenal gland that helps the kidney control salt, water, and potassium balance.\n\nNormal Results\n\nResults depend on:\n\nHow much sodium is in your diet\nWhether your kidneys work properly\nThe condition being diagnosed\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\n\nA higher than normal level of aldosterone may be due to:\n\nBartter syndrome (group of rare conditions that affect the kidneys)\nAdrenal glands release too much aldosterone hormone (primary hyperaldosteronism) usually due to a benign nodule in the adrenal gland)\nVery low-sodium diet\nTaking blood pressure medicines called mineralocorticoid antagonists\nAbuse of diuretics\nLiver cirrhosis\nHeart failure\nLaxative abuse\n\nLower than normal levels may indicate Addison disease, a disorder in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones.\n\nRisks\n\nThere are no risks with this test.\n\nAlternative Names\n\nAldosterone - urine; Addison disease - urine aldosterone; Cirrhosis - serum aldosterone\n\nReferences\n\nGuber HA, Oprea M, Russell YX.

For females, place the bag over the labia. Diaper as usual over the secured bag.\n\nThis procedure may take a couple of attempts. Active infants can move the bag, causing the urine to be absorbed by the diaper. The infant should be checked frequently and the bag changed after the infant has urinated into the bag. Drain the urine from the bag into the container provided by your lab or health care provider.\n\nDeliver it to the lab or your provider as soon as possible upon completion.\n\nHow to Prepare for the Test\n\nYour provider will tell you, if needed, to stop taking any medicines that may interfere with the test results.\n\nA number of medicines can change the test results. Make sure your provider knows about all medicines, herbs, vitamins, and supplements you are taking.\n\nThe following may also affect test results:\n\nA lack of fluid in your body (dehydration)\nAny type of x-ray exam with dye (contrast material) within 3 days before the urine test\nFluid from the vagina that gets into the urine\nSevere emotional stress\nStrenuous exercise\nUrinary tract infection\nHow the Test will Feel\n\nThe test involves only normal urination, and there is no discomfort.\n\nWhy the Test is Performed\n\nYour provider may order this test if blood, urine, or imaging tests find signs of reduced kidney function or kidney disease.\n\nTo avoid a 24-hour urine collection, your provider may be able to order a test that is done on just one urine sample (protein-to-creatinine ratio).\n\nNormal Results\n\nThe normal value is less than 100 milligrams per day or less than 10 milligrams per deciliter of urine.\n\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\n\nAbnormal results may be due to:\n\nA group of diseases in which a protein called amyloid builds up in the organs and tissues (amyloidosis)\nBladder tumor\nHeart failure\nHigh blood pressure during pregnancy (preeclampsia)\nKidney disease caused by diabetes, high blood pressure, autoimmune disorders, a blockage in the kidney system, certain medicines, toxins, a blockage of blood vessels, or other causes\nMultiple myeloma\n\nHealthy people may have higher than normal urine protein level after strenuous exercise or when they are dehydrated.

    "content": "25-hydroxy vitamin D test\n\t\n \n \n \n \n\nThe 25-hydroxy vitamin D test is the most accurate way to measure how much vitamin D is in your body.\n\nVitamin D helps regulate calcium and phosphate levels in the body.\n\nHow the Test is Performed\n\nA blood sample is needed.\n\nHow to Prepare for the Test\n\nUsually, you will not need to fast. But this depends on the laboratory and the testing method used. Follow any instructions for not eating before the test.\n\nHow the Test will Feel\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\n\nWhy the Test is Performed\n\nThis test is done to determine if you have too much or too little vitamin D in your blood. Screening of all adults, even when pregnant, for low vitamin D levels is generally not recommended.\n\nHowever, testing may be done on people who are at high risk for vitamin D deficiency, such as those who:\n\nAre over the age of 65 (both skin production of vitamin D and gut absorption of vitamin D becomes lower as we get older)\nAre obese (or have lost weight from bariatric surgery)\nAre taking certain medicines, such as phenytoin\nHave osteoporosis or thin bones\nHave limited sun exposure\nHave problems absorbing vitamins and nutrients in their intestines, such as those with ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, or celiac disease\nNormal Results\n\nThe normal range of 25-hydroxy vitamin D is measured as nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) or nanomoles/liter (nmol/L). Many experts recommend a level from 20 and 40 ng/mL or 60 and 100 nmol/L. Others recommend a level from 30 to 50 ng/mL (75 to 125 nmol/L).\n\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some laboratories use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results, and whether you may need vitamin D supplements.\n\nMany people are confused by the way these tests are reported.\n\n25 hydroxy vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is the vitamin D that your own body has made or that you absorbed from an animal source (such as fatty fish or liver) or a cholecalciferol supplement.\n25 hydroxy vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) is the vitamin D that you have absorbed from foods fortified with plant vitamin D or from an ergocalciferol supplement.\nThe two vitamins (ergo- and cholecalciferol) work similarly in the body. The important value is the total 25 hydroxy vitamin D level in your blood.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\n\nA lower-than-normal level can be due to a vitamin D deficiency, which can result from:\n\nLack of skin exposure to sunlight, darkly pigmented skin, or consistent use of high-SPF sunscreen\nLack of enough vitamin D in the diet\nLiver and kidney diseases\nPoor food absorption\nUse of certain medicines, including phenytoin, phenobarbital, and rifampin\nPoor vitamin D absorption due to advanced age, weight-loss surgery, or conditions in which fat is not absorbed well\n\nA low vitamin D level is more common in African American children (especially in the winter), as well as in infants who are breastfed only.\n\nA higher-than-normal vitamin D level (hypervitaminosis D) is most commonly caused by taking too much vitamin D. This can result in too much calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia). This may lead to many symptoms and kidney damage.\n\nRisks\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\nExcessive bleeding\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\n\n25-OH vitamin D test; Calcidiol; 25-hydroxycholecalciferol test\n\nReferences\n\nBouillon R, Verlinden L, Carmeliet G.

    "content": "**2q37 Deletion Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Description**\n\n2q37 deletion syndrome is a condition that can affect many parts of the body. Most babies with 2q37 deletion syndrome are born with weak muscle tone (hypotonia), which usually improves with age. Other neurological abnormalities that are common in affected individuals include mild to severe intellectual disability; delayed development of motor skills, such as sitting and walking; and behavioral problems. About 25 percent of people with this condition have autism spectrum disorder, a developmental condition that affects communication and social interaction.\n\nUnusual physical features are also common in people with 2q37 deletion syndrome. About half of affected individuals have unusually short fingers and toes (brachydactyly), often with abnormally short fourth toes that may overlap the other toes. Additional features of this condition may include short stature, obesity, or sparse hair. Many people with 2q37 deletion syndrome have characteristic facial features that can include a prominent forehead, a low frontal hairline, thin eyelids, skin folds covering the inner corner of the eyes (epicanthal folds), outside corners of the eyes that point upward (upslanting palpebral fissures), a small nose, a small mouth with thin lips, a smooth space between the upper lip and nose (smooth philtrum), prominent cheekbones, a large chin, and minor ear abnormalities.\n\nOther features of 2q37 deletion syndrome can include seizures and an inflammatory skin disorder called eczema. Some affected individuals have malformations of the brain, heart, gastrointestinal system, kidneys, or genitalia. A few people with 2q37 deletion syndrome develop a rare form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThe exact frequency of 2q37 deletion syndrome is unknown because many cases are not diagnosed. However, it's believed to occur in approximately 1 in every 100,000 births.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\n2q37 deletion syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material on the long arm (q) of chromosome 2 at band 37. This deletion can be inherited from one's parents or occur spontaneously during fetal development.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n2q37 deletion syndrome can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition. However, most cases are sporadic and not inherited from one's parents.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* 2q37 deletion syndrome\n* Chromosome 2q37 deletion syndrome\n* Deletion 2q37 syndrome\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on 2q37 deletion syndrome, please refer to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\n---\n\n**2q37 Deletion Syndrome**\n\n**What is 2q37 deletion syndrome?**\n\n2q37 deletion syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by deletions of genetic material from a specific region in the long (q) arm of chromosome 2.\n\n**Physical Features**\n\nAffected individuals often have characteristic facial features, including:\n\n* A prominent forehead\n* A low frontal hairline\n* Thin eyelids\n* Skin folds covering the inner corner of the eyes (epicanthal folds)\n* Outside corners of the eyes that point upward (upslanting palpebral fissures)\n* A small nose\n* A small mouth with thin lips\n* A smooth space between the upper lip and nose (smooth philtrum)\n* Prominent cheekbones\n* A large chin\n* Minor ear abnormalities\n\nOther physical features may include:\n\n* Unusually short fingers and toes (brachydactyly)\n* Short stature\n* Obesity\n* Sparse hair\n\n**Medical Features**\n\nAffected individuals may experience a range of medical issues, including:\n\n* Seizures\n* Eczema (inflammatory skin disorder)\n* Malformations of the brain, heart, gastrointestinal system, kidneys, or genitalia\n* Rare form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor\n\n**Intellectual Disability and Developmental Delays**\n\nMany affected individuals experience mild to severe intellectual disability, delayed development of motor skills, such as sitting and walking, and behavioral problems.\n\n**Autism Spectrum Disorder**\n\nAbout 25 percent of people with this condition have autism spectrum disorder, a developmental condition that affects communication and social interaction.\n\n**Causes**\n\n2q37 deletion syndrome is caused by deletions of genetic material from a specific region in the long (q) arm of chromosome 2. The deletions occur near the end of the chromosome at a location designated 2q37. The size of the deletion varies among affected individuals, with most affected people missing 2 million to 9 million DNA building blocks.\n\n**Genetic Basis**\n\nResearchers have determined that loss of a particular gene on chromosome 2, called HDAC4, is likely to account for many of the syndrome's characteristic signs (such as intellectual disability and skeletal abnormalities). While the deleted segment in 2q37 deletion syndrome varies in size, it always contains the HDAC4 gene.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nMost cases of 2q37 deletion syndrome are not inherited. They result from a chromosomal deletion that occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development. Rarely, an affected individual inherits a copy of chromosome 2 with a deleted segment from an affected parent.\n\n**Prevalence**\n\nAt least 115 cases have been reported worldwide, suggesting that 2q37 deletion syndrome is a rare condition.\n\n---\n\n**2q37 Deletion Syndrome**\n\n**What is 2q37 deletion syndrome?**\n\n2q37 deletion syndrome, also known as 2q37 microdeletion syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder caused by the deletion of a small part of chromosome 2. This deletion affects the development and functioning of various organs and systems in the body.\n\n**Causes of 2q37 deletion syndrome**\n\nThe causes of 2q37 deletion syndrome are not inherited. They result from a chromosomal deletion that occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development. Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family.\n\n**Inheritance pattern**\n\nRarely, an affected individual inherits a copy of chromosome 2 with a deleted segment from an affected parent. In these cases, the parent is usually less severely affected than the child, for reasons that are unknown. When an affected child inherits a chromosomal deletion from a parent, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered chromosome in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* 2q37 microdeletion syndrome\n* Albright hereditary osteodystrophy-like syndrome\n* Brachydactyly-mental retardation syndrome\n* Chromosome 2q37 deletion syndrome (disorder)\n* Deletion 2q37\n* Monosomy 2q37\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Information: Genetic Testing Registry: Chromosome 2q37 deletion syndrome\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: 2q37 microdeletion syndrome\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Clinical Trials: ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: CHROMOSOME 2q37 DELETION SYNDROME\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed: PubMed\n\n**References**\n\nAldred MA, Sanford RO, Thomas NS, Barrow MA, Wilson LC, Brueton LA, Bonaglia MC, Hennekam RC, Eng C, Dennis NR, Trembath RC.

    "content": "**3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA Lyase Deficiency**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Description**\n\n3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency, also known as HMG-CoA lyase deficiency, is an uncommon inherited disorder in which the body cannot process a particular protein building block (amino acid) called leucine. Additionally, the disorder prevents the body from making ketones, which are compounds that are used for energy during periods without food (fasting).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of HMG-CoA lyase deficiency usually appear within the first year of life. The condition causes episodes of vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, extreme tiredness (lethargy), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). During an episode, blood sugar (glucose) levels can become dangerously low (hypoglycemia), and a buildup of harmful compounds can cause the blood to become too acidic (metabolic acidosis). If untreated, the disorder can lead to breathing problems, convulsions, coma, and death. Episodes are often triggered by an infection, fasting, strenuous exercise, or other types of stress.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Frequency**\n\nHMG-CoA lyase deficiency is a rare condition; it has been reported in fewer than 100 individuals worldwide. Most people diagnosed with this disorder have been from Saudi Arabia, Portugal, or Spain.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the HMGCL gene cause HMG-CoA lyase deficiency. The HMGCL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme known as 3-hydroxymethyl-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A lyase (HMG-CoA lyase). This enzyme plays a critical role in breaking down dietary proteins and fats for energy. Specifically, it is responsible for processing leucine, an amino acid that is part of many proteins. HMG-CoA lyase also produces ketones during the breakdown of fats.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nHMG-CoA lyase deficiency is sometimes mistaken for Reye syndrome, a severe disorder that develops in children while they appear to be recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or flu. Most cases of Reye syndrome are associated with the use of aspirin during these viral infections.\n\n---\n\n**3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency**\n\nKetones are compounds that certain organs and tissues, particularly the brain, use for energy when the simple sugar glucose is not available. For example, ketones are important sources of energy during periods of fasting.\n\nIf a mutation in the HMGCL gene reduces or eliminates the activity of HMG-CoA lyase, the body is unable to process leucine or make ketones properly. When leucine is not processed normally, a buildup of chemical byproducts called organic acids can result in metabolic acidosis. A shortage of ketones often leads to hypoglycemia. Metabolic acidosis and hypoglycemia can damage cells, particularly in the brain, resulting in serious illness in children with HMG-CoA lyase deficiency.\n\n**The Gene Associated with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA Lyase Deficiency**\n\n*   **HMGCL**: The HMGCL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme known as 3-hydroxymethyl-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A lyase (HMG-CoA lyase). This enzyme plays a critical role in breaking down dietary proteins and fats for energy.\n*   **Function of the Enzyme**: HMG-CoA lyase is responsible for processing leucine, an amino acid that is part of many proteins. It also produces ketones during the breakdown of fats.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A lyase deficiency\n*   3-OH 3-CH3 glutaric aciduria\n*   3-OH 3-methyl glutaric aciduria\n*   3HMG Deficiency of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase\n*   HMG\n*   HMG-CoA lyase deficiency\n*   Hydroxymethylglutaric aciduria\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   **Genetic Testing Information**: Genetic Testing Registry: Deficiency of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase\n*   **Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria\n*   **Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   **Clinical Trials**: ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**: 3-HYDROXY-3-METHYLGLUTARYL-CoA LYASE DEFICIENCY; HMGCLD\n\n---\n\n**3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA Lyase Deficiency**\n\n**What is 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency?**\n\n3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency, also known as HMGCLD, is a rare genetic disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the breakdown of certain amino acids and fatty acids.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of HMGCLD can vary widely from person to person, but they often include:\n\n* Vomiting\n* Diarrhea\n* Abdominal pain\n* Fever\n* Lethargy\n* Seizures\n\nIn some cases, the symptoms may be less severe and may only become apparent during times of stress or illness.\n\n**Causes**\n\nHMGCLD is caused by a mutation in the HMGCL gene, which codes for the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase enzyme. This mutation can occur in one of the two copies of the gene, resulting in a partial deficiency of the enzyme.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThe diagnosis of HMGCLD is typically made through a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and genetic analysis. Laboratory tests may include:\n\n* Blood tests to measure levels of certain amino acids and fatty acids\n* Urine tests to detect the presence of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA\n\nGenetic analysis may involve testing for mutations in the HMGCL gene.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for HMGCLD, but treatment can help manage the symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment may include:\n\n* Dietary restrictions to avoid certain amino acids and fatty acids\n* Medications to control vomiting and diarrhea\n* Intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration\n* Antibiotics to treat secondary infections\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with HMGCLD varies widely depending on the severity of the symptoms and the effectiveness of treatment. In some cases, the disorder may be life-threatening if left untreated.\n\n**References**\n\n1.

People with this disorder have a shortage of an enzyme that helps break down proteins that contain a particular building block (amino acid) called leucine.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of MCC deficiency can vary among individuals, even among individuals in the same family. Some people with the genetic changes that cause MCC deficiency will not develop symptoms until adulthood, while many will never develop signs or symptoms.\n\nSome affected individuals develop signs and symptoms in infancy or early childhood after an event such as an infection, a long period without food, or the introduction of a high-protein diet. Features of MCC deficiency may include:\n\n*   Feeding difficulties\n*   Delayed development\n*   Vomiting\n*   Excessive tiredness (lethargy)\n*   Weak muscle tone (hypotonia)\n\nIf untreated, MCC deficiency can lead to seizures; breathing difficulties; and comas, which can be life-threatening.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAs many as 1 in 36,000 newborns may receive a diagnosis of MCC deficiency.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nVariants (also called mutations) in the MCCC1 or MCCC2 gene cause 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency. The condition is sometimes referred to as 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase 1 deficiency or 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase 2 deficiency depending on the specific gene that is affected.\n\nThese two genes provide instructions for making different parts (subunits) of an enzyme called 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC). This enzyme plays a critical role in breaking down proteins obtained from food. Specifically, MCC is responsible for the fourth step in the breakdown of leucine, an amino acid that is part of many proteins.\n\nVariants in the MCCC1 or MCCC2 gene reduce or eliminate the activity of MCC, preventing the body from processing leucine properly. In some people, these variants do not cause signs or symptoms. In others, toxic byproducts of leucine processing build up to harmful levels, which can damage the brain.

Beginning in infancy to early childhood, children with this condition often have delayed development of mental and motor skills (psychomotor delay), speech delay, involuntary muscle cramping (dystonia), and spasms and weakness of the arms and legs (spastic quadriparesis). Affected individuals can also have optic atrophy, which is the breakdown (atrophy) of nerve cells that carry visual information from the eyes to the brain.\n\nIn some cases, signs and symptoms of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency begin in adulthood, often in a person's twenties or thirties. These individuals have damage to a type of brain tissue called white matter (leukoencephalopathy). This damage likely contributes to progressive problems with speech (dysarthria), difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), stiffness (spasticity), optic atrophy, and a decline in intellectual function (dementia).\n\nAffected individuals who show symptoms of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency in childhood often go on to develop leukoencephalopathy and other neurological problems in adulthood.\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Inherited condition\n* Deficiency of the enzyme 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n* Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* 3-MG-CoA hydrolase deficiency\n* 3-MG-CoA hydratase deficiency\n* 3-MG-CoA hydrolyase deficiency\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\n**References**\n\n* MedlinePlus Genetics article on 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency\n\n---\n\n**3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency**\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the AUH gene cause 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency. This gene provides instructions for producing 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase, an enzyme that is involved in breaking down a protein building block (amino acid) called leucine to provide energy for cells. This amino acid is broken down in cell structures called mitochondria, which convert energy from food into a form that cells can use.\n\nAUH gene mutations lead to an absence of enzyme activity. Without any functional 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase, leucine is not properly broken down, which leads to a buildup of related compounds, including multiple acids: 3-methylglutaconic acid, 3-methylglutaric acid, and 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid. Researchers speculate that an accumulation of these acids in the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord (the cerebrospinal fluid or CSF) can damage these structures and contribute to the neurological features of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency.\n\nBecause the age at which the condition begins varies widely and because the signs and symptoms improve in some affected children, researchers speculate that other genes or environmental factors may play a role in the features of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.\n\n---\n\n**3-Methylglutaconic Aciduria Type I**\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.

This gene provides instructions for producing 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase, an enzyme that is involved in breaking down a protein building block (amino acid) called leucine to provide energy for cells. This amino acid is broken down in cell structures called mitochondria, which convert energy from food into a form that cells can use.\n\nAUH gene mutations lead to an absence of enzyme activity. Without any functional 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase, leucine is not properly broken down, which leads to a buildup of related compounds, including multiple acids: 3-methylglutaconic acid, 3-methylglutaric acid, and 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid. Researchers speculate that an accumulation of these acids in the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord (the cerebrospinal fluid or CSF) can damage these structures and contribute to the neurological features of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency.\n\nBecause the age at which the condition begins varies widely and because the signs and symptoms improve in some affected children, researchers speculate that other genes or environmental factors may play a role in the features of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.\n\n---\n\n**3-Methylglutaconic Aciduria Type I**\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, type I\n* 3-MG-CoA-hydratase deficiency\n* AUH defect\n* MGA, type I\n* MGA1\n* MGCA1\n* Primary 3-methylglutaconic aciduria\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* **Genetic Testing Information**\n\t+ Genetic Testing Registry: 3-Methylglutaconic aciduria type 1\n* **Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**\n\t+ 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type 1\n* **Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\t+ National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* **Clinical Trials**\n\t+ ClinicalTrials.gov\n* **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\t+ 3-METHYLGLUTACONIC ACIDURIA, TYPE I; MGCA1\n* **Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\t+ PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n* Eriguchi M, Mizuta H, Kurohara K, Kosugi M, Yakushiji Y, Okada R, Yukitake M, Hasegawa Y, Yamaguchi S, Kuroda Y. 3-Methylglutaconic aciduria type I causes leukoencephalopathy of adult onset.

    "title": "5-HTP: MedlinePlus Supplements",
    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/794.html",
    "content": "**5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)**\n\n**What is it?**\n\n5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) can be converted to serotonin in the body. It is often used for depression. It has less evidence for insomnia and anxiety.\n\n5-HTP is a chemical byproduct of the protein building block L-tryptophan. It is produced commercially from the seeds of an African plant known as Griffonia simplicifolia. 5-HTP works in the brain and central nervous system by increasing the production of the chemical serotonin. Serotonin can affect sleep, appetite, temperature, sexual behavior, and pain sensation.\n\nSince 5-HTP increases serotonin levels, it is used for conditions in which serotonin is believed to play an important role. These include depression, anxiety, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\nThe effectiveness ratings for 5-HTP are as follows:\n\n* Possibly effective for:\n\t+ Depression. Taking 5-HTP by mouth seems to improve symptoms of depression in some people. It might work as well as some prescription antidepressant drugs.\n* Possibly ineffective for:\n\t+ Down syndrome. Most research shows that taking 5-HTP by mouth does not improve muscle strength or development in children with Down syndrome.\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: It is possibly safe to take 5-HTP in doses of up to 400 mg daily for up to one year. The most common side effects include heartburn, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, drowsiness, sexual problems, and muscle problems. Large doses of 5-HTP, such as 6-10 grams daily, are possibly unsafe. These doses have been linked to severe stomach problems and muscle spasms.\n\nSome people who have taken 5-HTP have developed a serious health condition called eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS). Some people think EMS might be caused by an accidental contaminant in some 5-HTP products. But there's not enough scientific evidence to know if EMS is caused by 5-HTP, a contaminant, or some other factor. Until more is known, 5-HTP should be used cautiously.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n* Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if 5-HTP is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n* Children: It is possibly safe for children to take 5-HTP by mouth at appropriate doses. In children under 12 years of age, 5-HTP seems to be safe at a dose of up to 5 mg/kg daily for up to 3 years.\n\n**Are there interactions with medications?**\n\nYes, taking 5-HTP before surgery might cause too much serotonin in the brain and can result in serious side effects including heart problems, shivering, and anxiety. Tell patients to stop taking 5-HTP at least 2 weeks before surgery.\n\n**Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?**\n\nThere is interest in using 5-HTP for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\n5-HTP is typically taken by mouth in doses of up to 400 mg daily for up to one year.\n\n---\n\n**5-HTP: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Children**\n\nIt is possibly safe for children to take 5-HTP by mouth at appropriate doses. In children under 12 years of age, 5-HTP seems to be safe at a dose of up to 5 mg/kg daily for up to 3 years.\n\n**Surgery**\n\n5-HTP can affect a brain chemical called serotonin. Some drugs administered during surgery can also affect serotonin. Taking 5-HTP before surgery might cause too much serotonin in the brain and can result in serious side effects including heart problems, shivering, and anxiety. Tell patients to stop taking 5-HTP at least 2 weeks before surgery.\n\n**Interactions with Medications**\n\n* **Carbidopa (Lodosyn)**: 5-HTP can affect the brain. Carbidopa can also affect the brain. Taking 5-HTP along with carbidopa can increase the risk of serious side effects including rapid speech, anxiety, aggressiveness, and others.\n* **Sedative medications (CNS depressants)**: 5-HTP might cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Some medications, called sedatives, can also cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Taking 5-HTP with sedative medications might cause breathing problems and/or too much sleepiness.\n* **Serotonergic drugs**: 5-HTP might increase a brain chemical called serotonin. Some medications also have this effect. Taking 5-HTP along with these medications might increase serotonin too much. This might cause serious side effects including heart problems, seizures, and vomiting.\n\n**Interactions with Herbs and Supplements**\n\n* **Herbs and supplements with sedative properties**: 5-HTP might cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Taking it along with other supplements with similar effects might cause too much sleepiness and/or slowed breathing in some people. Examples of supplements with this effect include hops, kava, L-tryptophan, melatonin, and valerian.\n* **Herbs and supplements with serotonergic properties**: 5-HTP increases a brain chemical called serotonin. Taking it along with other supplements that have this effect might cause serious side effects, including heart problems, seizures, and vomiting. Examples of supplements with this effect include black seed, L-tryptophan, SAMe, and St. John's wort.\n\n**Interactions with Foods**\n\nThere are no known interactions with foods.\n\n**Typical Use**\n\n5-HTP has most often been used by adults in doses of 150-800 mg daily. Very large doses of 5-HTP, such as 6-10 grams daily, can cause serious side effects and should be avoided. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what dose might be best for a specific condition.\n\n**Other Names**\n\n2-Amino-3-(5-Hydroxy-1H-Indol-3-yl) Propanoic Acid, 5 Hydroxy-Tryptophan, 5 Hydroxy-Tryptophane, 5-Hydroxytryptophan, 5-Hydroxytryptophane, 5-Hydroxy L-Tryptophan, 5-Hydroxy L-Tryptophane, 5-Hydroxy Tryptophan, 5-L-Hydroxytryptophan, L-5 HTP, L-5-Hydroxytryptophan, L-5-Hydroxytryptophane, Oxitriptan.\n\n**References**\n\nRusso AM, Payet JM, Kent S, Lesku JA, Lowry CA, Hale MW.

    "content": "**A Guide to Clinical Trials for Cancer**\n\nIf you have cancer, a clinical trial may be an option for managing your cancer. A clinical trial is a study using people who agree to participate in new tests or treatments. Clinical trials help researchers know whether a new treatment works well and is safe. Trials are available for many cancers and all stages of cancer, not just advanced cancer.\n\n**What is a Clinical Trial for Cancer?**\n\nClinical trials for cancer look at ways to:\n\n*   **Prevent cancer**\n*   **Screen or test for cancer**\n*   **Treat or manage cancer**\n*   **Reduce symptoms or side effects of cancer or cancer treatments**\n\nA clinical trial will recruit many people to participate. During the study, each group of people will receive a different test or treatment. Some will get the new treatment being tested. Others will get standard treatment. The researchers will collect the results to see what works best.\n\n**Current Cancer Medicines, Tests, and Treatments**\n\nCurrent cancer medicines, tests, and treatments used by most health care providers have been tested through clinical trials.\n\n**Why Should You Consider a Clinical Trial?**\n\nThe decision to join a clinical trial is a personal one. It is a decision you have to make based on your values, goals, and expectations. Plus, there are benefits and risks when you join a trial.\n\nSome of the benefits include:\n\n*   **You may receive a new treatment that is not yet available to other people.**\n*   **You may receive treatment that is better than what is currently available.**\n*   **You will receive close attention and monitoring by your providers.**\n*   **You will help researchers understand your cancer and learn better ways to help other people with the same cancer.**\n\nSome of the potential risks include:\n\n*   **You may experience side effects.**\n*   **The new treatment may not work for you.**\n*   **The new treatment may not be as good as standard treatment.**\n*   **You may need more office visits and more tests.**\n*   **Your insurance may not pay for all of your costs in a clinical trial.**\n\n**Is It Safe?**\n\nThere are strict federal rules in place to protect your safety during a clinical trial. Safety guidelines (protocols) are agreed to before the study begins. These guidelines are reviewed by health experts to make sure that the study is based on good science and the risks are low. Clinical trials are also monitored during the entire study.\n\n**Before You Join a Clinical Trial**\n\nBefore you join a clinical trial, you will learn about the safety guidelines, what is expected of you, and how long the study will last. You will be asked to sign a consent form saying that you understand and agree to the way the study will be run and the potential side effects.\n\n**Is There a Cost?**\n\nBefore you join a trial, make sure you look into which costs are covered. Routine cancer care costs are often covered by health insurance. You should review your policy and contact your health plan to make sure. Often, your health plan will cover most routine office visits and consults, as well as tests done to monitor your health.\n\nResearch costs, such as the study medicine, or extra visits or tests, may need to be covered by the research sponsor. Also keep in mind that extra visits and tests may mean additional cost to you in lost work time and daycare or transportation costs.\n\n**Who Can Join a Clinical Trial?**\n\nEach clinical study has guidelines about who can join. These are called eligibility criteria. These guidelines are based on what questions the researchers are trying to answer. Studies often try to include people who have certain things in common. This can make it easier to understand the results. So you may be able to join only if you have cancer at a certain stage, are older or younger than a certain age, and do not have other health problems.\n\nIf you are eligible, you can apply to be in the clinical trial. Once accepted, you become a volunteer. This means that you may quit at any time. But if you feel you want to quit, be sure you talk it over with your provider first.\n\n**How to Find a Clinical Trial?**\n\nTrials are done in many places, such as:\n\n*   **Cancer centers**\n*   **Local hospitals**\n*   **Medical group offices**\n*   **Community clinics**\n\nYou can find clinical trials listed on the website of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) -- www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials. It is a part of the National Institutes of Health, the United States government research agency. Many of the clinical trials run across the country are sponsored by the NCI.\n\nIf you are interested in joining a clinical trial, talk with your provider. Ask if there is a trial in your area related to your cancer. Your provider can help you understand the type of care you will receive and how the trial will change or add to your care. You can also go over all of the risks and benefits to decide whether joining a trial is a good move for you.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n*   **Intervention study - cancer**\n\n**References**\n\n*   American Cancer Society website.

A clinical trial is a study using people who agree to participate in new tests or treatments. Clinical trials help researchers know whether a new treatment works well and is safe. Trials are available for many cancers and all stages of cancer, not just advanced cancer.\n\n**What is a Clinical Trial for Cancer?**\n\nClinical trials for cancer look at ways to:\n\n* Prevent cancer\n* Screen or test for cancer\n* Treat or manage cancer\n* Reduce symptoms or side effects of cancer or cancer treatments\n\nA clinical trial will recruit many people to participate. During the study, each group of people will receive a different test or treatment. Some will get the new treatment being tested. Others will get standard treatment. The researchers will collect the results to see what works best.\n\nCurrent cancer medicines, tests, and treatments used by most health care providers have been tested through clinical trials.\n\n**Why Should You Consider a Clinical Trial?**\n\nThe decision to join a clinical trial is a personal one. It is a decision you have to make based on your values, goals, and expectations. Plus, there are benefits and risks when you join a trial.\n\nSome of the benefits include:\n\n* You may receive a new treatment that is not yet available to other people.\n* You may receive treatment that is better than what is currently available.\n* You will receive close attention and monitoring by your providers.\n* You will help researchers understand your cancer and learn better ways to help other people with the same cancer.\n\nSome of the potential risks include:\n\n* You may experience side effects.\n* The new treatment may not work for you.\n* The new treatment may not be as good as standard treatment.\n* You may need more office visits and more tests.\n* Your insurance may not pay for all of your costs in a clinical trial.\n\n**Is It Safe?**\n\nThere are strict federal rules in place to protect your safety during a clinical trial. Safety guidelines (protocols) are agreed to before the study begins. These guidelines are reviewed by health experts to make sure that the study is based on good science and the risks are low. Clinical trials are also monitored during the entire study.\n\n**Who Can Join a Clinical Trial?**\n\nEach clinical study has guidelines about who can join. These are called eligibility criteria. These guidelines are based on what questions the researchers are trying to answer. Studies often try to include people who have certain things in common. This can make it easier to understand the results. So you may be able to join only if you have cancer at a certain stage, are older or younger than a certain age, and do not have other health problems.\n\n**How to Find a Clinical Trial?**\n\nTrials are done in many places, such as:\n\n* Cancer centers\n* Local hospitals\n* Medical group offices\n* Community clinics\n\nYou can find clinical trials listed on the website of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) -- www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials. It is a part of the National Institutes of Health, the United States government research agency. Many of the clinical trials run across the country are sponsored by the NCI.\n\nIf you are interested in joining a clinical trial, talk with your provider.

You can also go over all of the risks and benefits to decide whether joining a trial is a good move for you.\n\n**Is There a Cost?**\n\nBefore you join a trial, make sure you look into which costs are covered. Routine cancer care costs are often covered by health insurance. You should review your policy and contact your health plan to make sure. Often, your health plan will cover most routine office visits and consults, as well as tests done to monitor your health.\n\nResearch costs, such as the study medicine, or extra visits or tests, may need to be covered by the research sponsor. Also keep in mind that extra visits and tests may mean additional cost to you in lost work time and daycare or transportation costs.\n\n---\n\n**A Guide to Clinical Trials for Cancer**\n\n**What is a Clinical Trial?**\n\nA clinical trial is a research study that tests new treatments or medications for cancer. You will be one of the participants in this study, and your experience will help researchers understand your cancer and learn better ways to help other people with the same cancer.\n\n**Why Should You Consider a Clinical Trial?**\n\nThe decision to join a clinical trial is a personal one.

    "content": "**A Guide to Herbal Remedies**\n\nHerbal remedies are plants used like medicine. People use them to prevent or cure disease, relieve symptoms, boost energy, relax, or lose weight.\n\n**Herbals Are Not Medicines**\n\nYou must be careful when using an herbal remedy. Herbals are a type of dietary supplement and not medicines. Here's what you should know:\n\n*   Herbals are not regulated like medicines.\n*   Herbals do not need to be rigidly tested before they are sold.\n*   Herbals may not work as claimed.\n*   Labels do not need to be approved by any authority, and the correct amount of an ingredient may not be listed.\n*   Some herbal remedies may contain ingredients or contaminants not listed on the label.\n\n**Natural Does Not Mean Safe**\n\nMany people think using plants to treat illness is safer than taking medicine. People have been using plants in folk medicine for centuries. However, \"natural\" does not mean safe. Unless taken as directed, some herbals can interact with other medicines or be toxic at high doses. Some may cause side effects.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n*   Kava: used for anxiety, insomnia, symptoms of menopause, and other ailments. It may work for anxiety but can cause severe liver damage.\n*   St. John's Wort: may work for mild to moderate depression but can interact with birth control pills, antidepressants, and other medicines. It can also cause side effects like stomach upset and anxiety.\n*   Yohimbe: used to treat erectile dysfunction. The bark can cause high blood pressure, increased heart rate, anxiety, and other side effects. It can interact with certain medicines for depression.\n\nOf course, some herbals have been tested and work well for their intended purpose. Many are also quite safe, but the word \"natural\" will not tell you which ones are safe and which ones are not.\n\n**How to Choose and Use Herbal Remedies Safely**\n\nSome herbals can make you feel better and help keep you healthy. But you need to be a smart consumer. Use these tips when choosing herbal remedies:\n\n*   Look closely at the claims made about the product.\n*   Remember \"real-life stories\" are not scientific proof.\n*   Before trying a product, talk with your provider.\n*   Buy only from companies that have certification on the label.\n*   Do not give herbal supplements to children or use them if you are older than age 65 years. Talk to your provider first.\n*   Do not use herbals without talking to your provider if you are taking any medicines.\n*   Do not use them if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n*   Do not use them if you are having surgery.\n*   Always let your provider know what herbals you use.\n\n**Where to Get More Information**\n\nThese sites can help you learn more about specific herbal supplements:\n\n*   NIH MedlinePlus database of herbs and supplements -- medlineplus.gov/druginfo/herb_All.html\n*   The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH): Herbs at a glance -- nccih.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm\n*   American Cancer Society: Complementary and alternative medicine -- www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/complementary-and-alternative-medicine.html\n\n---\n\n**A Guide to Herbal Remedies**\n\nHerbal remedies are plants used like medicine.

Talk to your provider if you have any of these conditions. Certain medicines can also result in a false A1C level.\n\n---\n\n**A1C Test**\n\nThe A1C test is a blood test that measures the average level of glucose in your blood over the past 2-3 months. It's used to diagnose and monitor diabetes, as well as to assess the effectiveness of treatment.\n\n**What Does the A1C Test Measure?**\n\nThe A1C test measures the percentage of hemoglobin in your red blood cells that is bound to glucose. This gives an indication of your average blood sugar level over the past 2-3 months.\n\n**Who Should Get Tested?**\n\nYou should get tested if you have symptoms of diabetes, such as frequent urination, thirst, or blurred vision. You may also be tested if you have a family history of diabetes or are overweight.\n\n**What Are the Risks Involved with Having Your Blood Taken?**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks of having blood drawn are slight, but may include excessive bleeding, multiple punctures to locate veins, fainting or feeling lightheaded, hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin), and infection.\n\n**What Do Abnormal Results Mean?**\n\nAn abnormal result means that you have had a high blood sugar level over a period of weeks to months. If your A1C is 6.5% or higher and you do not already have diabetes, you may be diagnosed with diabetes. If your level is above 7% and you have diabetes, it often means that your blood sugar is not as well controlled as would be ideal.\n\n**How Can I Manage My Blood Sugar?**\n\nIf your A1C stays high, talk to your provider about how best to manage your blood sugar. This may include making lifestyle changes, such as losing weight or increasing physical activity, and taking medication if necessary.\n\n**References:**\n\n* American Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 6.

    "content": "**AAAS Gene**\n\nThe AAAS gene provides instructions for making a protein called ALADIN whose function is not well understood. Within cells, ALADIN is found in the nuclear envelope, the structure that surrounds the nucleus and separates it from the rest of the cell. Based on its location, ALADIN is thought to be involved in the movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Triple A Syndrome**: At least 49 mutations in the AAAS gene have been found to cause triple A syndrome. These mutations change the structure of ALADIN in different ways; however, almost all mutations prevent this protein from reaching its proper location in the nuclear envelope. The absence of ALADIN likely disrupts the movement of molecules across this membrane. Researchers suspect that DNA repair proteins may be unable to enter the nucleus if ALADIN is missing from the nuclear envelope. DNA damage that is not repaired can cause the cell to become unstable and lead to cell death. Although the nervous system is particularly vulnerable to DNA damage, it remains unknown exactly how mutations in the AAAS gene lead to the signs and symptoms of triple A syndrome.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n*   **AAA**\n*   **AAAS_HUMAN**\n*   **ACHALASIA, ADRENOCORTICAL INSUFFICIENCY, ALACRIMA (ALLGROVE, TRIPLE-A)**\n*   **ADRACALA**\n*   **ADRACALIN**\n*   **ALADIN**\n*   **DKFZp586G1624**\n*   **GL003**\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   **Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry**: Tests of AAAS\n*   **Scientific Articles on PubMed**: PubMed\n*   **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**: ALADIN WD REPEAT NUCLEOPORIN; AAAS\n\n---\n\n**AAAS Gene**\n\n**Gene and Variant Databases**\n\n*   **NCBI Gene**: Provides comprehensive information on the AAAS gene, including its genomic location on chromosome 12.\n*   **ClinVar**: Offers a database of genetic variants associated with the AAAS gene.\n\n**Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry**\n\n*   **Tests of AAAS**: A list of genetic tests available for detecting mutations in the AAAS gene.\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   **PubMed**: A comprehensive database of scientific articles, including those related to the AAAS gene and its associated disorders.\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   **ALADIN WD REPEAT NUCLEOPORIN; AAAS**: Information on the genetic relationship between the ALADIN protein and the AAAS gene.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Brooks BP, Kleta R, Stuart C, Tuchman M, Jeong A, Stergiopoulos SG, Bei T, Bjornson B, Russell L, Chanoine JP, Tsagarakis S, Kalsner L, Stratakis C.

    "content": "**ABAT Gene**\n\nThe ABAT gene provides instructions for making the GABA-transaminase enzyme. This enzyme helps break down a brain chemical (neurotransmitter) called GABA when it is not needed.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nGABA normally helps slow down (inhibit) brain cell activity when necessary, to prevent the brain from being overloaded with too many signals. For this reason GABA is called an inhibitory neurotransmitter.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **GABA-transaminase deficiency**: At least 10 mutations in the ABAT gene have been identified in people with GABA-transaminase deficiency, which is a brain disease (encephalopathy) that begins in infancy. Babies with this disorder have recurrent seizures (epilepsy), movement problems, and profoundly delayed development. They may grow more rapidly in length than usual (accelerated linear growth), even though they have feeding problems and may not gain weight as quickly as expected (failure to thrive). Individuals with this disorder usually do not survive past the first 2 years of life, but some live longer into childhood.\n\n    The ABAT gene mutations that cause GABA-transaminase deficiency lead to a shortage (deficiency) of functional GABA-transaminase enzyme. As a result, GABA is not properly broken down, so this neurotransmitter and another molecule called beta-alanine accumulate abnormally in brain cells. This accumulation alters the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain, leading to the neurological problems characteristic of GABA-transaminase deficiency. Excess GABA also leads to abnormal release of a protein that is necessary for growth of the body's bones and tissues (growth hormone), resulting in the accelerated linear growth that sometimes occurs in this disorder.\n\n**References**\n\n*   MedlinePlus Genetics\n\n---\n\n**ABAT Gene**\n\nThe ABAT gene is responsible for encoding the enzyme 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, which plays a crucial role in the breakdown of the neurotransmitter GABA.\n\n**Function of the ABAT Gene**\n\nThe ABAT gene helps regulate the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain, including GABA.

    "content": "**ABCA1 Gene**\n\nThe ABCA1 gene belongs to a group of genes called the ATP-binding cassette family. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that transport molecules across cell membranes.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\n* The ABCA1 protein is produced in many tissues, but high levels are found in the liver and immune cells called macrophages.\n* The ABCA1 protein helps move cholesterol and phospholipids across the cell membrane to the outside of the cell.\n* These substances are then picked up by a protein called apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), which is produced from the APOA1 gene.\n* ApoA-I, cholesterol, and phospholipids combine to make high-density lipoprotein (HDL), often referred to as \"good cholesterol\" because high levels reduce the chances of developing heart and blood vessel disease.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Familial HDL Deficiency**\n\t+ Variants in the ABCA1 gene can cause familial HDL deficiency.\n\t+ People with this condition have reduced levels of HDL in their blood and may experience early-onset cardiovascular disease, often before age 50.\n\t+ Two copies of the altered ABCA1 gene cause a more severe disorder called Tangier disease.\n\n---\n\n**ABCA1 Gene**\n\n**Tangier Disease**\n\nSeveral variants in the ABCA1 gene have been found to cause Tangier disease. Most of these variants change single amino acids in the ABCA1 protein. These variants prevent the release of cholesterol and phospholipids from cells. As a result, these substances accumulate within cells, causing certain body tissues to enlarge and the tonsils to acquire a yellowish-orange color. A buildup of cholesterol can be toxic to cells, leading to impaired cell function or cell death. In addition, the inability to transport cholesterol and phospholipids out of cells results in very low HDL levels, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n**Familial HDL Deficiency**\n\nVariants (also called mutations) in the ABCA1 gene can cause a condition called familial HDL deficiency. People with this condition have reduced levels of HDL in their blood and may experience early-onset cardiovascular disease, often before age 50.

    "content": "**ABCA3 Gene**\n\nThe **ABCA3 gene** provides instructions for making a protein involved in surfactant production. Surfactant is a mixture of certain fats (called phospholipids) and proteins that lines the lung tissue and makes breathing easy.\n\nWithout normal surfactant, the tissue surrounding the air sacs in the lungs (the alveoli) sticks together after exhalation (because of a force called surface tension), causing the alveoli to collapse. As a result, filling the lungs with air on each breath becomes very difficult, and delivery of oxygen to the body is impaired.\n\nThe **ABCA3 protein** is found in the membrane that surrounds lamellar bodies, which are the cellular structures in which the phospholipids and proteins that make up surfactant are packaged. The **ABCA3 protein** transports phospholipids into the lamellar bodies where they interact with surfactant proteins to form surfactant.\n\nThe **ABCA3 protein** also appears to be involved in the formation of normal lamellar bodies. In addition to packaging, lamellar bodies are important for the correct processing of surfactant proteins, which is necessary for the proteins to mature and become functional.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nMore than 100 **ABCA3 gene mutations** that cause surfactant dysfunction have been identified. Surfactant dysfunction due to mutations in this gene (often called **ABCA3 deficiency**) can cause severe, often fatal breathing problems in newborns or gradual onset of milder breathing problems in children or adults.\n\nSome mutations in the **ABCA3 gene lead** to the production of a protein that is not inserted into the lamellar body membrane. Other mutations lead to the production of an abnormal protein that is found in the lamellar body membrane but has little or no function.\n\nWithout **ABCA3 protein function**, the transport of surfactant phospholipids is decreased. In addition, lamellar body formation is impaired, which causes abnormal processing of surfactant proteins. **ABCA3 gene mutations** result in abnormal surfactant composition and function.\n\nThe loss of functional surfactant raises surface tension in the alveoli, causing difficulty breathing and collapse of the lungs.

The ABCA4 protein transports potentially toxic substances that can damage photoreceptors.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe ABCA4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in the retina, the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. Specifically, the ABCA4 protein is produced in the retina's light-sensing cells (photoreceptors). The ABCA4 protein transports potentially toxic substances that can damage photoreceptors. These substances form after phototransduction, the process by which light entering the eye is converted into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain. The ABCA4 protein removes one of these substances, called N-retinylidene-PE, from photoreceptors.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Cone-Rod Dystrophy**\n    Many variants (also called mutations) in the ABCA4 gene have been found to cause a vision disorder called cone-rod dystrophy. The problems associated with this condition include a loss of visual sharpness (acuity), an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), and impaired color vision. These vision problems worsen over time.\n*   **Stargardt Macular Degeneration**\n    More than 1,000 variants in the ABCA4 gene have been found to cause Stargardt macular degeneration. Variants in this gene are the most common cause of this eye disease.

The problems associated with this condition include a loss of visual sharpness (acuity), an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), and impaired color vision. These vision problems worsen over time.\n\nIt is estimated that ABCA4 gene variants account for 30 to 60 percent of cases of cone-rod dystrophy that are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder.\n\nMost of the ABCA4 gene variants that cause cone-rod dystrophy change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ABCA4 protein. The altered protein cannot remove N-retinylidene-PE from photoreceptors. As a result, N-retinylidene-PE combines with another substance to produce a molecule called N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine (A2E), which builds up in these cells.\n\nThe buildup of A2E is toxic to photoreceptors and leads to their deterioration, causing progressive vision loss in people with cone-rod dystrophy. Cone-rod dystrophy caused by ABCA4 gene variants tends to be associated with more severe vision problems than cone-rod dystrophy caused by other genetic variants.\n\n**Stargardt Macular Degeneration**\n\nMore than 1,000 variants in the ABCA4 gene have been found to cause Stargardt macular degeneration. Variants in this gene are the most common cause of this eye disease. Stargardt macular degeneration is characterized by vision loss that worsens over time.\n\nMost of these variants change amino acids in the ABCA4 protein. A malfunctioning ABCA4 protein cannot remove N-retinylidene-PE from photoreceptors. As a result, N-retinylidene-PE combines with another substance to produce a fatty yellow pigment called lipofuscin, which builds up in retinal cells.\n\nThe buildup of lipofuscin is toxic to the cells of the retina and causes progressive vision loss in people with Stargardt macular degeneration.\n\n**Age-Related Macular Degeneration**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Age-related macular degeneration.\n\n**Retinitis Pigmentosa**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Retinitis pigmentosa.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* ABCA4_HUMAN\n* ABCR\n* ATP-binding cassette sub-family A member 4\n* ATP-binding cassette transporter, retinal-specific\n* ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A (ABC1), member 4\n* photoreceptor rim protein\n* retina-specific ABC transporter\n* retinal-specific ATP-binding cassette transporter\n* RIM\n* ABC transporter\n* RMP\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about the genetic testing registry and scientific articles on PubMed.\n\n---\n\n**ABCA4 Gene**\n\n**Information & Resources**\n\nExpand Section\n\n* **Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry**\n\t+ Tests of ABCA4\n* **Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\t+ PubMed\n* **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\t+ ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY A, MEMBER 4; ABCA4\n* **Gene and Variant Databases**\n\t+ NCBI Gene\n\t+ ClinVar\n\n**References**\n\nExpand Section\n\n* Molday RS, Zhang K.

The protein essentially flips the phospholipids from the inside to the outside of the cells, releasing them into a digestive fluid called bile.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\n*   The ABCB4 gene (also known as MDR3) provides instructions for making a protein that helps move certain fats called phospholipids across the membranes of liver cells.\n*   The protein essentially flips the phospholipids from the inside to the outside of the cells, releasing them into a digestive fluid called bile.\n*   Outside the liver cells, in the bile duct, phospholipids attach (bind) to bile acids, which are the component of bile that digests fats. Large amounts of bile acids are potentially harmful to cells. When bile acids are bound to phospholipids, they are less toxic.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nSeveral variants in the ABCB4 gene have been found to cause severe forms of liver disease:\n\n*   **Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC3)**: Several variants in the ABCB4 gene have been found to cause a severe form of liver disease called progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3). The signs and symptoms of PFIC3 often appear in early childhood.\n*   **Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy**: Pregnant women with variants in the ABCB4 gene are at risk of developing a condition called intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.

The signs and symptoms of PFIC3 often appear in early childhood. PFIC3 causes progressive liver disease, which often leads to liver failure. Affected individuals have a variant in both copies of the ABCB4 gene. Variants that cause the cell to produce short, nonfunctional proteins or no proteins at all tend to be associated with more severe liver disease that appears earlier in life.\n\n**Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy**\n\nPregnant women with variants in the ABCB4 gene are at risk of developing a condition called intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Signs and symptoms typically include impaired bile secretion and severe itching during the second half of pregnancy.

This condition is characterized by the formation of small pebble-like deposits of cholesterol (known as gallstones) in the gallbladder or bile ducts. In people with LPAC, gallstones usually occur before age 40, which is young for the appearance of gallstones.\n\n---\n\n**ABCB4 Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 3/4)**\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nVariants in the ABCB4 gene are also associated with a rare condition called low phospholipid-associated cholelithiasis (LPAC). This condition is characterized by the formation of small pebble-like deposits of cholesterol (known as gallstones) in the gallbladder or bile ducts. In people with LPAC, gallstones usually occur before age 40, which is young for the appearance of gallstones. In addition, affected individuals may have an accumulation of small crystals of cholesterol (microlithiasis) or a material called biliary sludge in the bile ducts of the liver. Biliary sludge is made up of solid particles that are usually dissolved in bile, including cholesterol crystals and calcium salts.\n\nThe gallstones, cholesterol crystals, or biliary sludge can cause symptoms, such as pain, fever, nausea, or inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), that can recur even after the gallbladder is removed. It is thought that the variants in the ABCB4 gene that are involved in LPAC impair the protein's ability to transfer phospholipids into bile. Because phospholipids help keep cholesterol dissolved in bile, the lack of phospholipids can result in the formation of gallstones or crystals from undissolved cholesterol.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* ABC21\n* ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B (MDR/TAP), member 4\n* ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B, member 4\n* GBD1\n* ICP3\n* MDR3\n* Multidrug resistance 3\n* P-glycoprotein 3\n* PFIC-3\n* PGY3\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry: Tests of ABCB4\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed: PubMed\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY B, MEMBER 4; ABCB4\n\t+ GALLBLADDER DISEASE 1; GBD1\n* Gene and Variant Databases:\n\t+ NCBI Gene\n\t+ ClinVar\n\n**References**\n\n* Bacq Y, et al.

ABC transporter proteins carry many types of molecules across membranes in cells.\n\nThe **ABCB7** protein is located in the inner membrane of cell structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria are involved in a wide variety of cellular activities, including energy production, chemical signaling, and regulation of cell growth and division. In the mitochondria of developing red blood cells (erythroblasts), the **ABCB7** protein plays a critical role in the production of heme. Heme contains iron and is a component of hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in the blood.\n\nThe **ABCB7** protein is also involved in the formation of certain proteins containing clusters of iron and sulfur atoms (Fe-S clusters). Researchers suspect that the **ABCB7** protein transports Fe-S clusters from mitochondria, where they are formed, to the surrounding cellular fluid (cytosol), where they can be incorporated into proteins. Overall, researchers believe that the **ABCB7** protein helps maintain an appropriate balance of iron (iron homeostasis) in developing red blood cells.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia\n    At least three mutations in the **ABCB7** gene have been identified in people with X-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxia.

This protein is found primarily in the liver and kidneys, with small amounts in other tissues such as the skin, stomach, blood vessels, and eyes.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe MRP6 protein belongs to a group of proteins that transport molecules across cell membranes; however, little is known about the substances transported by MRP6. Some studies suggest that MRP6 stimulates the release of a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from cells through an unknown mechanism. This ATP is quickly broken down into other molecules called adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate. Pyrophosphate helps control deposition of calcium (calcification) and other minerals (mineralization) in the body.\n\nOther studies suggest that MRP6 transports a substance that is involved in the breakdown of ATP. This unidentified substance is thought to help prevent mineralization of tissues.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy (GACI)**: At least 13 mutations in the ABCC6 gene have been identified in individuals with GACI, a life-threatening disorder characterized by abnormal calcification in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the arteries).

These mutations lead to an absent or nonfunctional MRP6 protein.\n\n**Understanding ABCC6 Gene Mutations**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **MRP6 Protein**: The ABCC6 gene mutations involved in PXE and GACI lead to an absence or altered MRP6 protein that does not function properly.\n* **Loss of Function**: It is unclear how loss of MRP6 function leads to PXE and GACI. However, it may impair the release of ATP or the transport of a substance that normally prevents mineralization.\n\n**Relationship Between PXE and GACI**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Same Mutations**: The same mutations can cause GACI in some individuals and PXE in others.\n* **Unclear Mechanism**: It is not known why the same mutations can lead to different conditions. However, it may be related to differences in tissue distribution or function of the MRP6 protein.\n\n---\n\n**ABCC6 Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 3/5)**\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* ABC34\n* anthracycline resistance-associated protein ARA\n* ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C (CFTR/MRP), member 6\n* EST349056\n* MLP1\n* MOAT-E\n* MRP6\n* MRP6_HUMAN\n* multidrug resistance-associated protein 6\n* multispecific organic anion transporter-E\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n\t+ Tests of ABCC6\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n\t+ PubMed\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY C, MEMBER 6; ABCC6\n* Gene and Variant Databases:\n\t+ NCBI Gene\n\t+ ClinVar\n\n**References**\n\n* Bercovitch L, Terry P.

    "content": "**ABCC9 Gene**\n\nThe ABCC9 gene provides instructions for making the sulfonylurea receptor 2 (SUR2) protein. This protein forms one part (subunit) of a channel that transports charged atoms of potassium (potassium ions) across cell membranes.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\n* The SUR2 subunits regulate the activity of the channel, determining whether it is open or closed.\n* Channels made with the SUR2 protein are known as ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channels.\n* The channels open and close in response to the amount of ATP, the cell's main energy source, inside the cell.\n* The resulting transport of potassium ions is part of a complex network of signals that relay chemical messages into and out of cells.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Cantú Syndrome**: At least 14 mutations in the ABCC9 gene have been found to cause Cantú syndrome, a rare condition characterized by excess hair growth (hypertrichosis), a distinctive facial appearance, and heart defects.\n* **Familial Atrial Fibrillation**: Mutations in the ABCC9 gene may contribute to familial atrial fibrillation.\n* **Familial Dilated Cardiomyopathy**: Mutations in the ABCC9 gene have been associated with familial dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 9\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about various health conditions related to genetic changes.\n* References: A list of sources used to gather information about the ABCC9 gene.\n\n---\n\n**ABCC9 Gene**\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nAt least two mutations in the ABCC9 gene have been identified in people with dilated cardiomyopathy, a form of heart disease that enlarges and weakens the cardiac muscle, preventing the heart from pumping blood efficiently. Signs and symptoms of this condition can include an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), shortness of breath, extreme tiredness (fatigue), and swelling of the legs and feet. Research suggests that each mutation changes the structure of the SUR2 protein and disrupts the regulation of the K-ATP channel. Although K-ATP channels appear to play an important role in cardiac muscle, little is known about how malfunctioning channels are related to dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\n**Cantú Syndrome**\n\nAt least 14 mutations in the ABCC9 gene have been found to cause Cantú syndrome, a rare condition characterized by excess hair growth (hypertrichosis), a distinctive facial appearance, and heart defects. Each of the mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the SUR2 protein. These changes likely alter the structure of the protein and its ability to regulate the activity of K-ATP channels. Studies suggest that the abnormal channels are open when they should be closed. However, it is unknown how this problem with potassium channel function leads to excess hair growth, heart defects, and the other features of Cantú syndrome.\n\n**Familial Atrial Fibrillation**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Familial atrial fibrillation\n\n**Familial Dilated Cardiomyopathy**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Familial dilated cardiomyopathy\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* ABC37\n* ABCC9_HUMAN\n* ATFB12\n* ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 9\n* ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 9 isoform SUR2A\n* ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 9 isoform SUR2B\n* ATP-binding cassette transporter sub-family C member 9\n* ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C (CFTR/MRP), member 9\n* CANTU\n* CMD1O\n* sulfonylurea receptor 2\n* SUR2\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nTests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n\n* Tests of ABCC9\n\nScientific Articles on PubMed:\n\n* PubMed\n\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\n* ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY C, MEMBER 9; ABCC9\n* CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1O; CMD1O\n\n---\n\n**ABCC9 Gene**\n\n**Genomic Location**\nThe ABCC9 gene is found on chromosome 12.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Genes and Gene Therapy\n* Genetic Disorders\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n* What is DNA?\n* What is a gene?\n* What is a gene variant and how do variants occur?\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n* Bienengraeber M, Olson TM, Selivanov VA, Kathmann EC, O'Cochlain F, Gao F, Karger AB, Ballew JD, Hodgson DM, Zingman LV, Pang YP, Alekseev AE, Terzic A.

    "content": "**ABCD1 Gene**\n\nThe **ABCD1 gene** provides instructions for producing the adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP). ALDP is located in the membranes of cell structures called peroxisomes. Peroxisomes are small sacs within cells that process many types of molecules. ALDP brings a group of fats called very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) into peroxisomes, where they are broken down.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy**: More than 650 mutations in the ABCD1 gene have been found to cause X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. This condition is characterized by varying degrees of cognitive and movement problems as well as hormone imbalances. The mutations that cause X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy prevent the production of any ALDP in about 75 percent of people with this disorder. Other people with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy can produce ALDP, but the protein is not able to perform its normal function. With little or no functional ALDP, VLCFAs are not broken down, and they build up in the body. The accumulation of these fats may be toxic to the adrenal glands (small glands on top of each kidney) and to the fatty layer of insulation (myelin) that surrounds many nerves in the body. Research suggests that the accumulation of VLCFAs triggers an inflammatory response in the brain, which could lead to the breakdown of myelin. The destruction of these tissues leads to the signs and symptoms of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n*   **ABCD1_HUMAN**\n*   **ALD**\n*   **ALDP**\n*   **AMN**\n*   **ATP-binding cassette, sub-family D (ALD), member 1**\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   **Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry**: Tests of ABCD1\n*   **Scientific Articles on PubMed**: PubMed\n*   **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**: ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY D, MEMBER 1; ABCD1\n\n---\n\n**ABCD1 Gene**\n\n**Gene and Variant Databases**\n\n*   NCBI Gene\n*   ClinVar\n\n**Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry**\n\n*   Tests of ABCD1\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   PubMed\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY D, MEMBER 1; ABCD1\n\n**References**\n\n*   Hillebrand M, Verrier SE, Ohlenbusch A, Schafer A, Soling HD, Wouters FS, Gartner J.

    "title": "ABCG5 gene: MedlinePlus Genetics",
    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/abcg5/",
    "content": "**ABCG5 Gene**\n\nThe ABCG5 gene provides instructions for making sterolin-1, which makes up half of a protein called sterolin. The other half of the sterolin protein, sterolin-2, is produced from a gene called ABCG8.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nSterolin is involved in eliminating plant sterols, which are fatty components of plant-based foods that cannot be used by human cells. Sterolin is a transporter protein that moves substances across cell membranes. It is found mostly in cells of the intestines and liver and transports plant sterols.\n\nAfter plant sterols are absorbed from food into intestinal cells, the sterolin transporters in these cells pump them back into the intestinal tract. Sterolin transporters in liver cells pump the plant sterols into a fluid called bile that is released into the intestine. From the intestine, the plant sterols are eliminated with the feces.\n\nThis process removes most of the dietary plant sterols, and allows only about 5 percent of these substances to get into the bloodstream. Sterolin also helps regulate levels of cholesterol, another fatty substance found in animal products, in a similar fashion; normally about 50 percent of cholesterol in the diet is absorbed by the body.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nAt least 24 ABCG5 gene mutations have been identified in people with sitosterolemia, which is a condition caused by accumulation of plant sterols. The mutations result in a defective sterolin transporter and impair the elimination of plant sterols and, to a lesser degree, cholesterol from the body.\n\nThese fatty substances build up in the arteries, skin, and other tissues, resulting in clogged blood vessels that can impair blood flow (atherosclerosis), fatty skin growths (xanthomas), and the additional signs and symptoms of sitosterolemia. Excess plant sterols in red blood cells likely make their cell membranes stiff and prone to rupture, leading to a reduced number of red blood cells (anemia).\n\n---\n\n**ABCg5 Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nCertain normal variations (polymorphisms) in the **ABCG5** gene are associated with an increased risk of gallstones, which are small pebble-like deposits in the gallbladder or the bile ducts. Bile ducts carry bile (a fluid that helps digest fats) from the liver, where bile is produced, to the gallbladder, where it is stored, and to the small intestine, where it aids in digestion. Researchers suggest that the **ABCG5** gene changes that increase the risk of gallstones may result in a sterolin transporter protein that pumps more cholesterol than usual into bile. This leads to the presence of more cholesterol than can be dissolved in the bile fluid in the bile ducts and gallbladder, resulting in the formation of gallstones.\n\n**Sitosterolemia**\n\nAt least 24 **ABCG5** gene mutations have been identified in people with sitosterolemia, which is a condition caused by accumulation of plant sterols. The mutations result in a defective sterolin transporter and impair the elimination of plant sterols and, to a lesser degree, cholesterol from the body. These fatty substances build up in the arteries, skin, and other tissues, resulting in clogged blood vessels that can impair blood flow (atherosclerosis), fatty skin growths (xanthomas), and the additional signs and symptoms of sitosterolemia. Excess plant sterols in red blood cells likely make their cell membranes stiff and prone to rupture, leading to a reduced number of red blood cells (anemia). Changes in the lipid composition of the membranes of red blood cells and platelets may account for the other blood abnormalities that sometimes occur in sitosterolemia.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* **ABCG5_HUMAN**\n* ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 5\n* ATP-binding cassette, sub-family G (WHITE), member 5\n* ATP-binding cassette, subfamily G, member 5\n* sterolin 1\n* sterolin-1\n* STSL\n\n---\n\n**ABCG5 Gene**\n\nThe ABCG5 gene is located on chromosome 2.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Genes and Gene Therapy\n* Genetic Disorders\n\n**Genomic Location**\n\nThe ABCG5 gene is found on chromosome 2.\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n1.

    "content": "**ABCG8 Gene**\n\nThe ABCG8 gene provides instructions for making sterolin-2, which makes up half of a protein called sterolin. The other half of the sterolin protein, sterolin-1, is produced from a gene called ABCG5.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nSterolin is involved in eliminating plant sterols, which are fatty components of plant-based foods that cannot be used by human cells. Sterolin is a transporter protein, which moves substances across cell membranes. It is found mostly in cells of the intestines and liver and transports plant sterols.\n\nAfter plant sterols are absorbed from food into intestinal cells, the sterolin transporters in these cells pump them back into the intestinal tract. Sterolin transporters in liver cells pump the plant sterols into a fluid called bile that is released into the intestine. From the intestine, the plant sterols are eliminated with the feces.\n\nThis process removes most of the dietary plant sterols, and allows only about 5 percent of these substances to get into the bloodstream. Sterolin also helps regulate levels of cholesterol in a similar fashion; normally about 50 percent of cholesterol in the diet is absorbed by the body.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nAt least 28 ABCG8 gene mutations have been identified in people with sitosterolemia, which is a condition caused by accumulation of plant sterols. The mutations result in a defective sterolin transporter and impair the elimination of plant sterols and, to a lesser degree, cholesterol from the body.\n\nThese fatty substances build up in the arteries, skin, and other tissues, resulting in clogged blood vessels that can impair blood flow (atherosclerosis), fatty skin growths (xanthomas), and additional signs and symptoms of sitosterolemia. Excess plant sterols in red blood cells likely make their cell membranes stiff and prone to rupture, leading to a reduced number of red blood cells (anemia).\n\n---\n\n**ABCg8 Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nCertain normal variations (polymorphisms) in the **ABCG8 gene** are associated with an increased risk of gallstones, which are small pebble-like deposits in the gallbladder or the bile ducts. Bile ducts carry bile (a fluid that helps digest fats) from the liver, where bile is produced, to the gallbladder, where it is stored, and to the small intestine, where it aids in digestion. Researchers suggest that the **ABCG8 gene** changes that increase the risk of gallstones may result in a sterolin transporter protein that pumps more cholesterol than usual into bile. This leads to the presence of more cholesterol than can be dissolved in the bile fluid in the bile ducts and gallbladder, resulting in the formation of gallstones.\n\n**Sitosterolemia**\n\nAt least 28 **ABCG8 gene** mutations have been identified in people with sitosterolemia, which is a condition caused by accumulation of plant sterols. The mutations result in a defective sterolin transporter and impair the elimination of plant sterols and, to a lesser degree, cholesterol from the body. These fatty substances build up in the arteries, skin, and other tissues, resulting in clogged blood vessels that can impair blood flow (atherosclerosis), fatty skin growths (xanthomas), and the additional signs and symptoms of sitosterolemia. Excess plant sterols in red blood cells likely make their cell membranes stiff and prone to rupture, leading to a reduced number of red blood cells (anemia). Changes in the lipid composition of the membranes of red blood cells and platelets may account for the other blood abnormalities that sometimes occur in sitosterolemia.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* **ABCG8_HUMAN**\n* **ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 8**\n* **ATP-binding cassette, sub-family G (WHITE), member 8**\n* **ATP-binding cassette, subfamily G, member 8**\n* **GBD4 sterolin 2**\n* **sterolin-2**\n* **STSL**\n\n---\n\n**ABCG8 Gene**\n\nThe ABCG8 gene is located on chromosome 2.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Genes and Gene Therapy\n* Genetic Disorders\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n* Calandra S, Tarugi P, Speedy HE, Dean AF, Bertolini S, Shoulders CC.
