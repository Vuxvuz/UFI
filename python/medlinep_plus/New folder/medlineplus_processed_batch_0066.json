    "content": "**Esophageal Spasm**\n\n_Esophageal spasms are abnormal contractions of the muscles in the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. These spasms do not move food effectively to the stomach._\n\n**Causes**\n\n_The cause of esophageal spasm is unknown. Very hot or very cold foods may trigger spasms in some people._\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n_Symptoms may include:_\n\n* _Problems swallowing or pain with swallowing_\n* _Pain in the chest or upper abdomen_\n\n_It can be hard to tell a spasm from angina pectoris, a symptom of heart disease. The pain may spread to the neck, jaw, arms, or back._\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\n_Tests you may need to look for the condition include:_\n\n* _Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)_\n* _Esophageal manometry_\n* _Esophagogram (barium swallow x-ray)_\n\n---\n\n**Esophageal Spasm**\n\nAn esophageal spasm may come and go (intermittent) or last for a long time (chronic). Medicine can help relieve symptoms.\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\n*   Nitroglycerin given under the tongue (sublingual) may help a sudden episode of esophageal spasm. Long-acting nitroglycerin and calcium channel blockers are also used for the problem.\n*   Long-term (chronic) cases are sometimes treated with low-dose antidepressants such as trazodone or nortriptyline to reduce symptoms.\n*   Rarely, severe cases may need dilation (widening) of the esophagus or surgery to control symptoms.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nThe condition may not respond to treatment.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if you have symptoms of esophageal spasm that don't go away. The symptoms may actually be due to heart problems. Your provider can help decide if you need heart tests.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nAvoid very hot or very cold foods if you get esophageal spasms.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nDiffuse esophageal spasm; Spasm of the esophagus; Distal esophageal spasm; Nutcracker esophagus",

    "content": "**Benign Esophageal Stricture**\n\nA benign esophageal stricture is a narrowing of the esophagus (the tube from the mouth to the stomach) that causes swallowing difficulties.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n*   Eosinophilic esophagitis\n*   Injuries caused by an endoscope\n*   Long-term use of a nasogastric (NG) tube\n*   Swallowing substances that harm the lining of the esophagus, such as household cleaners, lye, disc batteries, or battery acid\n*   Treatment of esophageal varices\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Trouble swallowing\n*   Pain with swallowing\n*   Unintentional weight loss\n*   Regurgitation of food\n\n---\n\n**Esophageal Stricture - Benign**\n\nAn esophageal stricture is a narrowing of the esophagus that can cause trouble swallowing.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Acid reflux\n*   Eosinophilic esophagitis\n*   Swallowing substances that can harm your esophagus, such as household cleaners, lye, disc batteries, or battery acid\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Trouble swallowing\n*   Pain with swallowing\n*   Unintentional weight loss\n*   Regurgitation of food\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYou may need the following tests:\n\n*   Barium swallow to look for narrowing of the esophagus\n*   Endoscopy (EGD or esophagogastroduodenoscopy) to look for narrowing of the esophagus\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe main treatment for acid reflux-related strictures is dilation (stretching) of the esophagus using a thin cylinder or balloon that is inserted through an endoscope. You may need to have this treatment repeated after a period of time to prevent the stricture from narrowing again.\n\nProton pump inhibitors (acid-blocking medicines) can keep an acid reflux-related stricture from returning. Surgery is rarely needed.\n\nIf you have eosinophilic esophagitis, you may need to take medicines or make changes to your diet to reduce the inflammation. In some cases, dilation is done.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe stricture may come back in the future. This may require a repeat dilation.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nSwallowing problems may keep you from getting enough fluids and nutrients. Solid food, especially meat, can get stuck above the stricture. If this happens, endoscopy would be needed to remove the lodged food.\n\nThere is also a higher risk of having food, fluid, or vomit enter the lungs with regurgitation. This can cause choking or aspiration pneumonia.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if you have swallowing problems that do not go away.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nUse safety measures to avoid swallowing substances that can harm your esophagus. Keep dangerous chemicals out of the reach of children. See your provider if you have GERD.\n\n---\n\n**Esophageal Stricture - Benign**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Chronic inflammation of the esophagus, often due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n*   Long-term use of certain medications, such as tetracycline and doxycycline\n*   Radiation therapy to the chest or abdomen\n*   Infections, such as tuberculosis or fungal infections\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), which can worsen over time\n*   Regurgitation of food, especially if the stricture is severe\n*   Chest pain or discomfort, especially after eating\n*   Weight loss and poor appetite due to difficulty swallowing\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\n*   Upper endoscopy: a flexible tube with a camera is inserted through the mouth to visualize the esophagus and identify any narrowing or obstruction\n*   Barium swallow: a liquid containing barium sulfate is swallowed, and X-rays are taken to show the outline of the esophagus and any abnormalities\n*   Esophageal manometry: a test that measures the muscle contractions in the esophagus during swallowing\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\n*   Endoscopic dilation: a balloon or dilator is inserted through the mouth to widen the narrowed area of the esophagus\n*   Anti-reflux surgery: surgery to reduce acid reflux and prevent further inflammation and scarring\n*   Medications: antacids, histamine-2 blockers, or proton pump inhibitors to reduce stomach acid and alleviate symptoms\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\n*   Follow a healthy diet with soft foods and avoid spicy or acidic foods that can irritate the esophagus\n*   Eat slowly and chew food thoroughly to prevent further irritation and inflammation\n*   Avoid lying down after eating and elevate the head of your bed by 6 inches to reduce acid reflux\n\n\\n\\n",

    "content": "**Esophagectomy - Minimally Invasive**\n\nMinimally invasive esophagectomy is surgery to remove part or all of the esophagus. This is the tube that moves food from your throat to your stomach. After it is removed, the esophagus is rebuilt from part of your stomach or part of your large intestine.\n\n**Description**\n\nDuring minimally invasive esophagectomy, small surgical cuts (incisions) are made in your upper belly, chest, or neck. A viewing scope (laparoscope) and surgical tools are inserted through the incisions to perform the surgery. Laparoscopic surgery is generally done in the following way:\n\n* You'll receive general anesthesia at the time of your surgery.\n* The surgeon makes 3 to 4 small cuts in your upper belly, chest, or lower neck. These cuts are about 1-inch (2.5 cm) long.\n* The laparoscope is inserted through one of the cuts into your upper belly. The scope has a light and camera on the end. Video from the camera appears on a monitor in the operating room.\n* Other surgical tools are inserted through the other cuts.\n* The surgeon frees the esophagus from nearby tissues. Depending on how much of your esophagus is diseased, part or most of it is removed.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nThe most common reason for removing part, or all, of your esophagus is to treat cancer of the esophagus. You may also have radiation therapy or chemotherapy before or after surgery.\n\nSurgery to remove the lower esophagus may also be done to treat:\n\n* A condition in which the ring of muscle in the esophagus does not work well (achalasia)\n* Severe damage of the lining of the esophagus that can lead to cancer (Barrett esophagus)\n* Severe trauma\n\n**Risks**\n\nThis is major surgery and has many risks. Some of them are serious. Be sure to discuss these risks with your surgeon.\n\nRisks for this surgery, or for problems after surgery, may be higher than normal if you:\n\n* Are unable to walk even for short distances (this increases the risk for blood clots, lung problems, and pressure sores)\n* Are older than 60 years\n* Are a heavy smoker\n* Are obese\n* Have lost a lot of weight from your cancer\n* Are on steroid medicines\n* Have had a severe infection from the damaged esophagus/stomach\n\nHad cancer drugs (chemotherapy) before the surgery\n\nRisks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n* Allergic reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots, or infection\n\nRisks for this surgery are:\n\n* Acid reflux\n* Injury to the stomach, intestines, lungs, or other organs during surgery\n* Leakage of the contents of your esophagus or stomach where the surgeon joined them together\n* Narrowing of the connection between your stomach and esophagus\n* Pneumonia\n* Difficulty swallowing or speaking\n\nBowel obstruction\n\n---\n\n**Esophagectomy - Minimally Invasive**\n\n**What is Esophagectomy?**\n\nEsophagectomy is surgery to remove part or all of the esophagus, the tube that moves food from your throat to your stomach.

Some of these are:\n\n* A complete physical examination.\n* Visits with your health care provider to make sure other medical problems you may have, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart or lung problems, are under control.\n* Nutritional counseling.\n* A visit or class to learn what happens during surgery, what you should expect afterward, and what risks or problems may occur afterward.\n\n**During the Week Before Surgery**\n\nYou may be asked to stop taking blood thinner drugs. Some of these are aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), vitamin E, warfarin (Coumadin), and clopidogrel (Plavix).\n\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\n\nPrepare your home for after surgery.\n\n**On the Day of Surgery**\n\nFollow instructions on when to stop eating and drinking before surgery.\n\nTake the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\n\nArrive at the hospital on time.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nMost people stay in the hospital for 7 to 14 days after an esophagectomy. How long you stay will depend on what type of surgery you had. You may spend 1 to 3 days in the intensive care unit (ICU) right after surgery.\n\nDuring your hospital stay, you will:\n\n* Be asked to sit on the side of your bed and walk on the same day or day after surgery.\n* Not be able to eat for at least the first 2 to 7 days after surgery. After that, you may be able to start with liquids. You will be fed through a feeding tube that was placed into your intestine during surgery.\n* Have a tube coming out of the side of your chest to drain fluids that build up.\n* Wear special stockings on your feet and legs to prevent blood clots.\n* Receive shots to prevent blood clots.\n* Receive pain medicine through an IV or take pills. You may receive your pain medicine through a special pump. With this pump, you press a button to deliver pain medicine when you need it.\n\nAfter you go home, follow instructions on how to take care of yourself as you heal. You'll be given information on diet and eating. Be sure to follow those instructions as well.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMany people recover well from this surgery and can have a fairly normal diet. After they recover, they will likely need to eat smaller portions and eat more often.\n\nIf you had the surgery for cancer, talk with your provider about the next steps to treat the cancer.\n\n---\n\n**Esophagectomy - Minimally Invasive**\n\n\\n\\n**Description**\n\nDuring minimally invasive esophagectomy, small surgical cuts (incisions) are made in your upper belly, chest, or neck.

Depending on how much of your esophagus is diseased, part or most of it is removed.\n*   If part of your esophagus is removed, the remaining ends are joined together using staples or stitches. If most of your esophagus is removed, the surgeon reshapes your stomach into a tube to make a new esophagus. It is joined to the remaining part of the esophagus.\n*   During surgery, lymph nodes in your chest and belly are likely removed to determine if cancer has spread to them.\n*   A feeding tube is placed in your small intestine so that you can be fed while you are recovering from surgery.\n\nSome medical centers do this operation using robotic surgery. In this type of surgery, a small scope and other instruments are inserted through the small cuts in the skin. The surgeon controls the scope and instruments while sitting at a computer station and viewing a monitor.\n\nSurgery usually takes 3 to 6 hours.\n\n\\n\\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nThe most common reason for removing part, or all, of your esophagus is to treat cancer of the esophagus.

    "content": "**Esophagectomy - open**\n\nOpen esophagectomy is surgery to remove part or all of the esophagus. This is the tube that moves food from your throat to your stomach. After it is removed, the esophagus is rebuilt from part of your stomach or part of your large intestine.\n\nMost of the time, esophagectomy is done to treat cancer of the esophagus or a severely damaged esophagus.\n\n**Description**\n\nDuring open esophagectomy, one or more large surgical cuts (incisions) are made in your belly, chest, or neck. This article discusses three types of open surgery. With any surgery, you will receive medicine (anesthesia) that will keep you asleep and pain-free.\n\n* **Transhiatal esophagectomy:**\n\t+ The surgeon makes two large cuts. One cut is in your neck area and one is in your upper belly.\n\t+ From the cut in the belly, the surgeon frees the stomach and lower part of the esophagus from the nearby tissues. From the cut in the neck, the rest of the esophagus is freed.\n\t+ The surgeon then removes the part of your esophagus where the cancer or other problem is.\n\t+ Your stomach is then reshaped into a tube to make a new esophagus. It is joined to the remaining part of your esophagus with staples or stitches.\n* **Transthoracic esophagectomy:** This surgery is done in a similar way as the transhiatal procedure. But the upper cut is made in your right chest, not in the neck.\n* **En bloc esophagectomy:**\n\t+ The surgeon makes large cuts in your neck, chest, and belly. All of your esophagus and part of your stomach are removed.\n\t+ The rest of your stomach is reshaped into a tube and placed in your chest to replace your esophagus. The stomach tube is connected to the remaining esophagus in the neck.\n\nMost of these operations take 3 to 6 hours.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nSurgery to remove the lower esophagus may also be done to treat:\n\n* A condition in which the ring of muscle in the esophagus does not work well (achalasia)\n* Severe damage of the lining of the esophagus that can lead to cancer (Barrett esophagus)\n* Severe trauma\n* Destroyed esophagus\n* Severely damaged stomach\n\n**Risks**\n\nThis is major surgery and has many risks.

The fluid contains acid, which irritates the esophageal lining.\n*   An autoimmune and allergic disorder called eosinophilic esophagitis also causes this condition.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\n*   Alcohol use\n*   Cigarette smoking\n*   Surgery or radiation to the chest (for example, treatment for lung cancer)\n*   Taking certain medicines such as alendronate, doxycycline, ibandronate, risedronate, tetracycline, potassium tablets, and vitamin C, without drinking plenty of water\n*   Vomiting\n*   Lying down after eating a large meal\n*   Obesity\n\n**Infections**\n\n*   People who have a weakened immune system may develop infections. Infections may lead to swelling of the food pipe.\n*   Infection may be due to:\n    *   Fungi or yeast (most often Candida)\n    *   Viruses, such as herpes or cytomegalovirus\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   The infection or irritation may cause the food pipe to become inflamed. Sores called ulcers may form.\n*   Symptoms may include:\n    *   Cough\n    *   Difficulty swallowing\n    *   Painful swallowing\n    *   Heartburn (acid reflux)\n    *   Hoarseness\n    *   Sore throat\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\n*   Your health care provider may recommend the following tests:\n    *   Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), removing a piece of tissue from the food pipe for examination (biopsy).\n    *   Upper GI series (barium swallow x-ray).\n    *   pH testing. This test monitors for acid coming from the stomach into the esophagus.\n\n**Treatment**\n\n*   Treatment depends on the cause. Common treatment options are:\n    *   Medicines that reduce stomach acid in case of reflux disease\n    *   Antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals to treat different infections\n    *   Medicines and diet changes to treat eosinophilic esophagitis\n    *   Medicines to coat the lining of the food pipe to treat damage related to pills\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\n*   Most of the time, the disorders that cause swelling and inflammation of the food pipe, respond to treatment.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\n*   If not treated, this condition may cause severe discomfort. Scarring (stricture) of the food pipe may develop. This can cause swallowing problems.\n*   A condition called Barrett esophagus (BE) can develop after years of GERD. Rarely, BE may lead to cancer of the food pipe.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\n*   Contact your provider if you have:\n    *   Frequent symptoms of esophagitis\n    *   Difficulty swallowing\n    *   Frequent vomiting\n    *   Vomiting blood\n    *   Acid reflux uncontrolled by medicines\n    *   Unexpected weight loss\n\n---\n\n**Esophagitis**\n\nEsophagitis is a condition in which the lining of the esophagus becomes swollen, inflamed, or irritated. The esophagus is the tube that leads from your mouth to the stomach. It is also called the food pipe.\n\n**Causes**\n\nEsophagitis is often caused by stomach fluid that flows back into the food pipe. The fluid contains acid, which irritates the esophageal lining. This problem is called gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). An autoimmune and allergic disorder called eosinophilic esophagitis also causes this condition.\n\nThe following increase your risk for esophagitis:\n\n*   Alcohol use\n*   Cigarette smoking\n*   Surgery or radiation to the chest (for example, treatment for lung cancer)\n*   Taking certain medicines such as alendronate, doxycycline, ibandronate, risedronate, tetracycline, potassium tablets, and vitamin C, without drinking plenty of water\n*   Vomiting\n*   Lying down after eating a large meal\n*   Obesity\n\nPeople who have a weakened immune system may develop infections.

It is essential to recognize the symptoms of esophagitis to seek medical attention promptly.\n\n**Symptoms of Esophagitis:**\n\n*   Difficulty swallowing\n*   Frequent vomiting\n*   Vomiting blood\n*   Acid reflux that cannot be controlled by medications\n*   Unexpected weight loss\n\nIf you experience any of these symptoms, it is crucial to consult your healthcare provider as soon as possible.\n\n**Alternative Names for Esophagitis:**\n\n*   Inflammation - esophagus\n*   Erosive esophagitis\n*   Ulcerative esophagitis\n*   Eosinophilic esophagitis\n\nThese names highlight the different forms and causes of esophagitis, emphasizing the importance of accurate diagnosis and treatment.\n\n**Patient Instructions:**\n\nIf you have been diagnosed with esophagitis, your healthcare provider may recommend the following:\n\n*   Anti-reflux surgery - discharge\n*   Lifestyle changes to manage symptoms and prevent complications\n\nIt is essential to follow your healthcare provider's instructions carefully to ensure proper management of your condition.\n\n**Images:**\n\nVisual aids such as images can help illustrate the anatomy of the esophagus and stomach, making it easier to understand the relationship between these organs and the development of esophagitis.\n\n**References:**\n\nThe following references provide additional information on esophagitis:\n\n*   Falk GW, Katzka DA.

You may not be aware of your esophagus until you swallow something too large, too hot, or too cold. You may also notice it when something is wrong. You may feel pain or have trouble swallowing.\n\n**Common Problems**\n\nThe most common problem with the esophagus is GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). With GERD, a muscle at the end of your esophagus does not close properly. This allows stomach contents to leak back, or reflux, into the esophagus and irritate it. Over time, GERD can cause damage to the esophagus.\n\nOther problems include:\n\n* Heartburn\n* Cancer\n* Eosinophilic esophagitis\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDoctors may use various tests to make a diagnosis. These include:\n\n* Imaging tests\n* An upper endoscopy\n* A biopsy\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment depends on the problem. Some problems get better with over-the-counter medicines or changes in diet.

    "content": "**Essential Thrombocythemia**\n\n**What is Essential Thrombocythemia?**\n\nEssential thrombocythemia (ET) is a condition where the bone marrow produces too many platelets. Platelets are particles in the blood that aid in blood clotting.\n\n**Causes and Symptoms**\n\nET results from an overproduction of platelets. As these platelets do not work normally, blood clots and bleeding are common problems. Untreated, ET worsens over time.\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\n* Headache (most common)\n* Tingling, coldness, or blueness in the hands and feet\n* Feeling dizzy or lightheaded\n* Vision problems\n* Mini-strokes (transient ischemic attacks) or stroke\n\nIf bleeding is a problem, symptoms may include:\n\n* Easy bruising and nosebleeds\n* Bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory system, urinary tract, or skin\n* Bleeding from the gums\n* Prolonged bleeding from surgical procedures or tooth removal\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nMost of the time, ET is found through blood tests done for other health problems before symptoms appear.\n\nOther tests may include:\n\n* Bone marrow biopsy\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Genetic tests (to look for a change in the JAK2, CALR, or MPL gene)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIf you have life-threatening complications, you may have a treatment called platelet pheresis. It quickly reduces the number of platelets in the blood.\n\nLong-term, medicines are used to decrease the platelet count to avoid complications. The most common medicines used include hydroxyurea, interferon-alpha, or anagrelide.\n\nAspirin at a low dose (81 to 100 mg per day) may decrease clotting episodes.\n\nMany people do not need any treatment, but they must be followed closely by their provider.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nOutcomes may vary. Most people can go for long periods without complications and have a normal lifespan. In a small number of people, complications from bleeding and blood clots can cause serious problems.\n\nIn rare cases, the disease can change into acute leukemia or myelofibrosis.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Acute leukemia or myelofibrosis\n* Severe bleeding (hemorrhage)\n* Stroke, heart attack, or blood clots\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* You have unexplained bleeding that continues longer than it should.\n* You notice chest pain, leg pain, confusion, weakness, numbness, or other new symptoms.\n\n---\n\n**Essential Thrombocythemia**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nEssential thrombocythemia (ET) is a condition where the bone marrow produces too many platelets. Platelets are tiny particles in the blood that help with blood clotting.\n\n**Causes**\n\nET occurs when there's an overproduction of platelets. These abnormal platelets don't work properly, leading to common problems like blood clots and bleeding. If left untreated, ET worsens over time.\n\nET is part of a group of conditions called myeloproliferative disorders, which include:\n\n*   Chronic myelogenous leukemia (an overproduction of white blood cells that starts in the bone marrow)\n*   Polycythemia vera (bone marrow disease that leads to an abnormal increase in red blood cells)\n*   Primary myelofibrosis (disorder of the bone marrow where scar tissue replaces healthy tissue)\n\nMany people with ET have a mutation in one of three genes: JAK2, CALR, or MPL.\n\nET is most common in middle-aged people but can also affect younger individuals, particularly women under 40.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPossible symptoms include:\n\n*   Headache (most common)\n*   Tingling, coldness, or blueness in the hands and feet\n*   Feeling dizzy or lightheaded\n*   Vision problems\n*   Mini-strokes (transient ischemic attacks) or stroke\n\nIf bleeding is a concern, symptoms may include:\n\n*   Easy bruising and nosebleeds\n*   Bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory system, urinary tract, or skin\n*   Bleeding from the gums\n*   Prolonged bleeding from surgical procedures or tooth removal\n\n---\n\n**Essential Thrombocythemia**\n\n**What is Essential Thrombocythemia?**\n\nEssential thrombocythemia (ET) is a type of blood disorder characterized by the excessive production of platelets in the bone marrow. It is one of the myeloproliferative neoplasms, which are a group of disorders that affect the bone marrow and cause an overproduction of blood cells.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of ET is unknown, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some people may be more prone to developing ET due to their family history or certain genetic mutations.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of ET can vary widely from person to person, but common ones include:\n\n*   Thrombosis (blood clots)\n*   Bleeding\n*   Abdominal pain\n*   Fatigue\n*   Weight loss\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nET is typically diagnosed through a combination of physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests. These may include:\n\n*   Complete blood count (CBC) to check for abnormal platelet counts\n*   Bone marrow biopsy to examine the bone marrow tissue\n*   Genetic testing to identify specific mutations associated with ET\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment of ET depends on the individual's symptoms, platelet count, and overall health. Some common treatments include:\n\n*   Aspirin or other antiplatelet medications to prevent blood clots\n*   Anticoagulant medications to treat existing blood clots\n*   Low-dose heparin to prevent blood clot formation\n*   Surgery or other interventions to remove large blood clots\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for people with ET varies widely depending on the severity of their symptoms and their response to treatment. With proper management, many people with ET can lead normal lives and enjoy a good quality of life.\n\n**References**\n\nGotlib J.

    "content": "**Essential Tremor**\n\n\\n\\n**What is Essential Tremor?**\n\nEssential tremor (ET) is a type of involuntary shaking movement. It has no identified cause. Involuntary means you shake without trying to do so and are not able to stop the shaking at will.\n\n\\n\\n**Causes of Essential Tremor**\n\nET is the most common type of tremor. Everyone has some tremor at times, but the movements are usually so small that they can't be seen. ET affects both men and women. It is most common in people older than 65 years.\n\nThe exact cause of ET is unknown. Research suggests that the part of the brain that controls muscle movements does not work correctly in people with ET.\n\nIf an ET occurs in more than one member of a family, it is called a familial tremor. This type of ET is passed down through families (inherited). This suggests that genes play a role in its cause.\n\nFamilial tremor is usually a dominant trait. This means that you only need to get the gene from one parent to develop the tremor. It often starts in early middle age, but may be seen in people who are older or younger, or even in children.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms of Essential Tremor**\n\nThe tremor is more likely to be noticed in the forearm and hands. The arms, head, eyelids, or other muscles may also be affected. The tremor rarely occurs in the legs or feet. A person with ET may have trouble holding or using small objects such as silverware or a pen.\n\nThe shaking most often involves small, rapid movements occurring 4 to 12 times a second.\n\nSpecific symptoms may include:\n\n* Head nodding\n* A shaking or quivering sound to the voice if the tremor affects the voice box\n* Problems with writing, drawing, drinking from a cup, or using tools if the tremor affects the hands\n\nThe tremors may:\n\n\\n\\n**Exams and Tests for Essential Tremor**\n\nYour health care provider can make the diagnosis by performing a physical exam and asking about your medical and personal history.\n\nTests may be needed to check for other reasons for the tremors such as:\n\n* Smoking and smokeless tobacco\n* Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)\n* Suddenly stopping alcohol after drinking a lot for a long time (alcohol withdrawal)\n* Too much caffeine\n* Use of certain medicines\n* Nervousness or anxiety\n\nBlood tests and imaging tests (such as a CT scan of the head, brain MRI, and x-rays) are usually normal.\n\n\\n\\n**Treatment of Essential Tremor**\n\nTreatment may not be needed unless the tremors interfere with your daily activities or cause embarrassment.\n\nHOME CARE\n\nFor tremors made worse by stress, try techniques that help you relax. For tremors of any cause, avoid caffeine and get enough sleep.\n\nFor tremors caused or made worse by a medicine, talk to your provider about stopping the medicine, reducing the dosage, or switching. Do not change or stop any medicine on your own.\n\nSevere tremors make it harder to do daily activities. You may need help with these activities. Things that can help include:\n\n* Buying clothes with Velcro fasteners, or using button hooks\n* Cooking or eating with utensils that are weighted and have a larger handle\n* Using straws to drink\n* Wearing slip-on shoes and using shoehorns\n\nMEDICINES FOR TREMOR\n\nMedicines may help relieve symptoms. The most commonly used medicines include:\n\n* Propranolol, a beta blocker\n* Primidone, a medicine used to treat seizures\n\nThese medicines can have side effects.\n\nPropranolol may cause fatigue, stuffy nose, or slow heartbeat, and it may make asthma worse.\nPrimidone may cause drowsiness, problems concentrating, nausea, and problems with walking, balance, and coordination.\n\nOther medicines that may reduce tremors include:\n\n* Antiseizure medicines\n* Mild tranquilizers\n* Blood pressure medicines called calcium-channel blockers\n\nBotulinum toxin injections may be tried to reduce tremors.\n\nSURGERY\n\nIn severe cases, surgery may be tried. This may include:\n\n* Focusing high-powered x-rays on a small area of the brain (stereotactic radiosurgery)\n* Implanting a stimulating device in the brain to signal the area that controls movement (deep brain stimulation)\n\n\\n\\n**Outlook (Prognosis) for Essential Tremor**\n\nAn ET is not a dangerous problem. But some people find the tremors annoying and embarrassing. In some cases, it may be dramatic enough to interfere with work, writing, eating, or drinking.\n\nPossible Complications\n\nSometimes, the tremors affect the vocal cords, which may lead to speech problems.\n\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* You have a new tremor\n* Your tremor makes it hard to perform daily activities\n* You have side effects from the medicines used to treat your tremor\n\n---\n\n**Essential Tremor**\n\n**What is Essential Tremor?**\n\nEssential tremor (ET) is a type of involuntary shaking movement.

The tremors can be quite dramatic and may interfere with daily activities such as work, writing, eating, or drinking.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of essential tremor is still unknown, but it is believed to be related to abnormalities in the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. It tends to run in families, suggesting a genetic component.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe most common symptom of essential tremor is a trembling or shaking movement of the hands, arms, head, voice, or other parts of the body. The tremors can be quite pronounced and may be accompanied by other symptoms such as:\n\n*   **Speech problems**: In some cases, the tremors can affect the vocal cords, leading to speech difficulties.\n*   **Daily activity impairment**: The tremors can make it challenging to perform daily tasks.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThere is no specific test for essential tremor, and diagnosis is often based on clinical evaluation. A healthcare provider may use various diagnostic tools such as:\n\n*   **Medical history**: To identify any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to the tremors.\n*   **Physical examination**: To assess the severity of the tremors and rule out other potential causes.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for essential tremor depends on the severity of the symptoms. In mild cases, lifestyle changes such as:\n\n*   **Alcohol consumption**: Drinking small amounts of alcoholic beverages may help alleviate the tremors.\n*   **Medications**: Various medications can be used to reduce the frequency and severity of the tremors.\n\nIn more severe cases, other treatment options may include:\n\n*   **Botulinum toxin injections**: To temporarily reduce muscle activity and alleviate symptoms.\n*   **Surgery**: In rare instances, surgery may be considered to treat the underlying cause of the tremors.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nEssential tremor is not a dangerous condition, but it can be quite debilitating for some individuals. With proper treatment and management, many people with essential tremor are able to lead normal lives despite their symptoms.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile there is no known way to prevent essential tremor, maintaining good overall health through:\n\n*   **Regular exercise**: Engaging in regular physical activity can help improve muscle strength and coordination.\n*   **Balanced diet**: Eating a well-balanced diet rich in nutrients can help support overall health.\n\nBy understanding the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of essential tremor, individuals can better manage their condition and improve their quality of life.",

Also tell your doctor if you smoke or use tobacco, as this may increase the risk of serious health problems.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\nCommon side effects include breast tenderness, nausea, vomiting, and vaginal bleeding. Call your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms: sudden severe headache, speech problems, dizziness, sudden complete or partial loss of vision, crushing chest pain, coughing up blood, or difficulty thinking clearly.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\nStore the patch at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

The longer you use estradiol, the greater the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer.\n*   If you have not had a hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus), you should be given another medication called a progestin to take with transdermal estradiol. This may decrease your risk of developing endometrial cancer but may increase your risk of developing certain other health problems, including breast cancer.\n*   Before you begin using transdermal estradiol, tell your doctor if you have or have ever had cancer and if you have unusual vaginal bleeding.\n\n**Side Effects**\n\n*   The following symptoms can be signs of the serious health conditions listed above.

It is usually applied once or twice a week, depending on the brand of patch that is used. Some women wear a patch all the time, and other women wear a patch according to a rotating schedule that alternates 3 weeks when the patch is worn followed by 1 week when the patch is not worn.\n\n* Always apply your transdermal patch on the same day(s) of the week every week.\n* Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n* Use transdermal estradiol exactly as directed. Do not apply more or fewer patches or apply the patches more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of transdermal estradiol and may increase your dose if your symptoms are still bothersome. If you are already taking or using an estrogen medication, your doctor will tell you how to switch from the estrogen medication you are taking or using to transdermal estradiol.\n\n**Applying the Patch**\n\n* Apply estradiol patches to clean, dry, cool skin in the lower stomach area, below your waistline.\n* Some brands of patches may also be applied to the upper buttocks. Ask your doctor or pharmacist or read the manufacturer's information that comes with your patches to find the best place(s) to apply the brand of patches you have received.\n* Do not apply estradiol patches to the breasts or to skin that is oily, damaged, cut, or irritated.\n* Do not apply estradiol patches to the waistline where they may be rubbed off by tight clothing or to the lower buttocks where they may be rubbed off by sitting.\n\n**Removing and Disposing of the Patch**\n\n* When it is time to remove the patch, slowly peel it off of your skin.\n* Fold the patch in half so that the sticky sides are pressed together and dispose of it safely, so that it is out of reach of children and pets.\n* If a sticky substance remains on your skin after you remove the patch, wait 15 minutes and then remove the substance using an oil or lotion.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n* Tear open the pouch with your fingers. Do not use scissors because they may damage the patch.\n* Remove the protective liner from the patch and press the sticky side of the patch against your skin in the area you have chosen to wear your patch.\n* Press down on the patch with your fingers or palm for 10 seconds. Be sure that the patch is firmly attached to your skin, especially around its edges.\n* Wear the patch all the time until it is time to remove it.\n\n**Important Reminders**\n\n* Read the manufacturer's information carefully before you start using estradiol transdermal and each time you refill your prescription.\n* Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.\n\n---\n\n**Estradiol Transdermal Patch: Application and Use Instructions**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Applying the Patch**\n    Tear open the pouch with your fingers. Do not use scissors because they may damage the patch. Do not open the pouch until you are ready to apply the patch.\n    Remove the patch from the pouch. There may be a silver foil sticker used to protect the patch from moisture inside the pouch. Do not remove this sticker from the pouch.\n    Remove the protective liner from the patch and press the sticky side of the patch against your skin in the area you have chosen to wear your patch. Some patches have a liner that is made to peel off in two pieces. If your patch has that type of liner, you should peel off one part of the liner and press that side of the patch against your skin. Then fold back the patch, peel off the other part of the liner and press the second side of the patch against your skin. Always be careful not to touch the sticky side of the patch with your fingers.\n    Press down on the patch with your fingers or palm for 10 seconds. Be sure that the patch is firmly attached to your skin, especially around its edges.\n\n*   **Wearing and Removing the Patch**\n    Wear the patch all the time until it is time to remove it. When it is time to remove the patch, slowly peel it off of your skin. Fold the patch in half so that the sticky sides are pressed together and dispose of it safely, so that it is out of reach of children and pets.\n    If a sticky substance remains on your skin after you remove the patch, you should wait 15 minutes and then remove the substance using an oil or lotion.\n\n*   **Special Instructions**\n    Always apply your transdermal patch on the same day(s) of the week every week. There may be a calendar on the inner flap of your medication carton where you can keep track of your patch change schedule.\n    Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use transdermal estradiol exactly as directed. Do not apply more or fewer patches or apply the patches more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n*   **Applying Estradiol Patches**\n    You should apply estradiol patches to clean, dry, cool skin in the lower stomach area, below your waistline. Some brands of patches may also be applied to the upper buttocks. Ask your doctor or pharmacist or read the manufacturer's information that comes with your patches to find the best place(s) to apply the brand of patches you have received.\n    Do not apply estradiol patches to the breasts or to skin that is oily, damaged, cut, or irritated. Do not apply estradiol patches to the waistline where they may be rubbed off by tight clothing or to the lower buttocks where they may be rubbed off by sitting.\n\n*   **Swimming, Bathing, Showering, and Saunas**\n    Talk to your doctor or pharmacist or read the manufacturer's information that came with your medication to find out if you need to be careful when you swim, bathe, shower, or use a sauna while wearing an estradiol transdermal patch. Some brands of patches are not likely to be affected by these activities, but some brands of patches may loosen.\n\n*   **Replacing the Patch**\n    If the patch loosens or falls off before it is time to replace it, try to press it back in place with your fingers. Be careful not to touch the sticky side of the patch with your fingers while you are doing this. If the patch cannot be pressed back on, fold it in half so it sticks to itself, dispose of it safely, so that it is out of the reach of children and pets, and apply a fresh patch to a different area. Replace the fresh patch on your next scheduled patch change day.\n\n*   **Manufacturer's Information**\n    Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.\n\n---\n\n**Estradiol Transdermal Patch**\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore using transdermal estradiol, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to any brand of transdermal estradiol, any other estrogen products, any other medications, any adhesives, or any of the ingredients in estradiol transdermal patches.

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nIn women, most estradiol is released from the ovaries and adrenal glands. It is also released by the placenta during pregnancy. Estradiol is also produced in other body tissues, such as skin, fat, cells bone, brain, and liver. Estradiol plays a role in:\n\n*   Growth of the womb (uterus), fallopian tubes, and vagina\n*   Breast development\n*   Changes of the outer genitals\n*   Distribution of body fat\n*   Menopause\n\nIn men, a small amount of estradiol is mainly released by the testes. Estradiol helps prevent sperm from dying too early.\n\nThis test may be ordered to check:\n\n*   How well your ovaries, placenta, or adrenal glands work\n*   If you have signs of an ovarian tumor\n*   If male or female body characteristics are not developing normally\n*   If your periods have stopped (levels of estradiol vary, depending on the time of month)\n\nThe test may also be ordered to check if:\n\n*   Hormone therapy is working for women in menopause\n*   A woman is responding to fertility treatment\n\nThe test may also be used to monitor people with hypopituitarism and women on certain fertility treatments.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe results may vary, depending on the person's sex and age.\n\n*   Male: 10 to 50 pg/mL (36.7 to 183.6 pmol/L)\n*   Female (premenopausal): 30 to 400 pg/mL (110 to 1468.4 pmol/L)\n*   Female (postmenopausal): 0 to 30 pg/mL (0 to 110 pmol/L)\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test result.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nDisorders that are associated with abnormal estradiol results include:\n\n*   Early puberty (precocious puberty) in girls\n*   Growth of abnormally large breasts in men (gynecomastia)\n*   Lack of periods in women (amenorrhea)\n*   Reduced function of the ovaries (ovarian hypofunction)\n*   Problem with genes, such as Klinefelter syndrome or Turner syndrome\n*   Rapid weight loss or low body fat\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.

The dosage and frequency of administration will depend on the individual's specific needs and medical condition.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nIn addition to treating menopausal symptoms and osteoporosis, estrogen injection may also be used to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, and dementia in certain cases.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\n*   If you have not had a hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus), your doctor may prescribe another medication called a progestin to take with estrogen injection.\n*   Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had cancer, unusual vaginal bleeding, high blood pressure, high blood levels of cholesterol or fats, diabetes, heart disease, lupus, breast lumps, or an abnormal mammogram.\n*   Inform your doctor if you smoke or use tobacco, have had a heart attack or stroke in the past year, or have a family history of blood clots or breast cancer.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nThere are no specific dietary instructions for estrogen injection. However, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and diet is essential for overall well-being.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you miss a dose of estrogen injection, contact your doctor for guidance on how to proceed.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nCommon side effects of estrogen injection may include breast tenderness, nausea, vomiting, and changes in menstrual flow. In rare cases, more serious health conditions such as endometrial cancer, heart attacks, strokes, blood clots, and dementia may occur.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nEstrogen injection should be stored at room temperature (59°F to 86°F) away from direct sunlight. Dispose of the medication properly after use, following your doctor's instructions.\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you experience any symptoms such as sudden severe headache, vomiting, speech problems, dizziness or faintness, sudden complete or partial loss of vision, double vision, weakness or numbness of an arm or a leg, crushing chest pain or chest heaviness, coughing up blood, sudden shortness of breath, difficulty thinking clearly, remembering, or learning new things, breast lumps or other breast changes, discharge from nipples, or pain, tenderness, or redness in one leg, seek immediate medical attention.\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\n*   Use the lowest dose of estrogen that controls your symptoms and only use estrogen injection as long as needed.\n*   Talk to your doctor every 3-6 months to decide if you should use a lower dose of estrogen or should stop using the medication.\n*   Examine your breasts every month and have a mammogram and breast exam performed by a doctor every year to help detect breast cancer.\n\n**Brand names**\n\nEstrogen injection is available under various brand names, including Premarin (Wyeth Pharmaceuticals).\n\n**Other names**\n\nEstrogen injection may also be known as estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) or hormone replacement therapy (HRT).\n\n---\n\n**Estrogen Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nThe estradiol cypionate and estradiol valerate forms of estrogen injection are used to treat hot flushes (hot flashes; sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating) and/or vaginal dryness, itching, and burning in women who are experiencing menopause (change of life; the end of monthly menstrual periods). However, women who need a medication only to treat vaginal dryness, itching, or burning should consider a different treatment. These forms of estrogen injection are also sometimes used to treat the symptoms of low estrogen in young women who do not produce enough estrogen naturally. The estradiol valerate form of estrogen injection is also sometimes used to relieve the symptoms of certain types of prostate (a male reproductive organ) cancer. The conjugated estrogens form of estrogen injection is used to treat abnormal vaginal bleeding that a doctor has decided is caused only by a problem with the amounts of certain hormones in the body.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nThe estradiol cypionate and estradiol valerate forms of long acting estrogen injection come as a liquid to inject into a muscle. These medications are usually injected by a health care professional once every 3 to 4 weeks. When the estradiol valerate form of estrogen injection is used to treat the symptoms of prostate cancer, it is usually injected by a health care professional once every 1 to 2 weeks.\n\nThe conjugated estrogens form of estrogen injection comes as a powder to mix with sterile water and inject into a muscle or vein. It is usually injected by a health care professional as a single dose. A second dose may be injected 6 to 12 hours after the first dose if it is needed to control vaginal bleeding.\n\n**Precautions**\n\nYou are having surgery or will be on bedrest. Your doctor may tell you to stop using estrogen injection 4-6 weeks before the surgery or bedrest to decrease the risk that you will develop blood clots.\n\nTalk to your doctor regularly about the risks and benefits of using estrogen injection.\n\n**Side Effects and Risks**\n\nEstrogen increases the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the uterus [womb]). The longer you use estrogen, the greater the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer. If you have not had a hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus), you should be given another medication called a progestin to take with estrogen injection. This may decrease your risk of developing endometrial cancer, but may increase your risk of developing certain other health problems, including breast cancer.\n\nIn a large study, women who took estrogen with progestins by mouth had a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots in the lungs or legs, breast cancer, and dementia (loss of ability to think, learn, and understand). Women who use estrogen injection alone or with progestins may also have a higher risk of developing these conditions.\n\nTell your doctor if you smoke or use tobacco, if you have had a heart attack or a stroke in the past year, and if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had blood clots or breast cancer. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had high blood pressure, high blood levels of cholesterol or fats, diabetes, heart disease, lupus (a condition in which the body attacks its own tissues causing damage and swelling), breast lumps, or an abnormal mammogram (x-ray of the breast used to find breast cancer).\n\n**Symptoms to Watch For**\n\nThe following symptoms can be signs of the serious health conditions listed above. Call your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms while you are using estrogen injection:\n\n* Sudden, severe headache\n* Sudden, severe vomiting\n* Speech problems\n* Dizziness or faintness\n* Sudden complete or partial loss of vision\n* Double vision\n* Weakness or numbness of an arm or a leg\n* Crushing chest pain or chest heaviness\n* Coughing up blood\n* Sudden shortness of breath\n* Difficulty thinking clearly, remembering, or learning new things\n* Breast lumps or other breast changes\n* Discharge from nipples\n* Pain, tenderness, or redness in one leg\n\n---\n\n**Estrogen Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/5)**\n\n**How Should This Medicine Be Used?**\n\nThe estradiol cypionate and estradiol valerate forms of long acting estrogen injection come as a liquid to inject into a muscle. These medications are usually injected by a health care professional once every 3 to 4 weeks. When the estradiol valerate form of estrogen injection is used to treat the symptoms of prostate cancer, it is usually injected by a health care professional once every 1 to 2 weeks.\n\nThe conjugated estrogens form of estrogen injection comes as a powder to mix with sterile water and inject into a muscle or vein. It is usually injected by a health care professional as a single dose. A second dose may be injected 6 to 12 hours after the first dose if it is needed to control vaginal bleeding.\n\nIf you are using estrogen injection to treat hot flushes, your symptoms should improve within 1 to 5 days after you receive the injection. Tell your doctor if your symptoms do not improve during this time.\n\n**Other Uses for This Medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What Special Precautions Should I Follow?**\n\nBefore using estrogen injection, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to estrogen injection, any other estrogen products, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in estrogen injection.

    "content": "**Estrogen Levels Test**\n\nWhat is an estrogen test?\n\nAn estrogen test measures the level of estrogens usually in a sample of your blood, but sometimes in urine (pee).\n\nEstrogens are a group of hormones that play a key role in female reproductive health, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause. Estrogens are also important for heart, bone, and brain health in males and females. But males need estrogen in much smaller amounts.\n\nThere are many types of estrogen, but only three types are commonly tested:\n\n* **Estrone (E1)**: The only estrogen that females continue to make after menopause. Males and females make estrone in the adrenal glands and in body fat.\n* **Estradiol (E2)**: The main estrogen in nonpregnant females of childbearing age. It's mostly made in the ovaries and is important for fertility and brain and bone health.\n* **Estriol (E3)**: An estrogen that increases during pregnancy. Measuring estriol levels can help monitor the health of a pregnancy and the unborn baby.\n\nWhat is it used for?\n\nIn females, estradiol and/or estrone testing may be used:\n\n* To help diagnose conditions caused by estrogen levels that are too high or too low\n* To monitor infertility treatments, hormone replacement therapy for menopause, and hormone treatment for certain cancers\n\nDuring pregnancy, an estriol hormone test may be used to:\n\n* Help diagnose certain birth defects\n* Monitor a high-risk pregnancy\n\nIn males, estradiol and/or estrone tests may be used to see whether too much estrogen is causing conditions such as late puberty, breast growth, infertility, or erectile dysfunction.\n\nWhy do I need an estrogen test?\n\nYou may need an estrogen test if you:\n\n* Are female and have early or delayed puberty\n* Are childbearing age and have abnormal periods or no periods at all\n* Are having trouble getting pregnant\n* Have a high-risk pregnancy\n* Have symptoms of menopause, including hot flashes and/or night sweats\n* Use hormone replacement therapy after menopause\n* Have vaginal bleeding after menopause\n\nIf you're pregnant, you may have an estriol test between weeks 15 and 20 of your pregnancy.\n\nWhat happens during an estrogen test?\n\nYou will provide a blood or urine sample. If you use an at-home test, the sample is usually saliva (spit).\n\nFor a blood test: A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle.\n\nFor a urine test: You'll need to collect all your urine during a 24-hour period.\n\nFor an at-home saliva test: You'll collect a sample of saliva and send it to a lab for testing.\n\nWill I need to do anything to prepare for the test?\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for an estrogen test.\n\nAre there any risks to the test?\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\nWhat do the results mean?\n\nYour test results will mean different things depending on your age, sex, and reasons for having the test. Talk with your provider to find out what your results mean for your health.\n\n---\n\n**Estrogen Levels Test**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nAn estrogen test measures the level of estrogens usually in a sample of your blood, but sometimes in urine (pee).

The test can check whether your baby has a high risk for a genetic birth defect such as Down syndrome.\n\n**What happens during an estrogen test?**\n\nIf you are tested at your provider's office or a lab, you will provide a blood or urine sample. If you use an at-home test, the sample is usually saliva (spit).\n\nFor a blood test: A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle.\n\nFor a urine test: You'll need to collect all your urine during a 24-hour period. This is called a 24-hour urine sample test.\n\nFor an at-home saliva test: You'll collect a sample of saliva and send it to a lab for testing.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for an estrogen test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\nThere is no known risk to a urine or saliva test.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nYour test results will mean different things depending on:\n\n* Your age\n* Your sex\n* The reasons for having the test\n* The type of estrogen that was measured\n* The results of other tests you may have had\n\nTalk with your provider to find out what your results mean for your health. Because estrogen levels often change, you may need to be tested more than once to look for a trend in your estrogen levels over time.\n\n---\n\n**Estrogen Levels Test**\n\nIf you're considering an estrogen levels test, keep in mind that it may take multiple tests to detect changes in your estrogen levels over time.

    "content": "**Estrogen Receptor, Progesterone Receptor Tests**\n\n**What are estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) tests?**\n\nEstrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) tests are done on samples of your tissue that contain breast cancer cells. The tests check if your cancer cells have estrogen and progesterone receptors (proteins that estrogen and progesterone attach to). The results of the tests are used to help guide breast cancer treatment.\n\n**Receptors**\n\nReceptors are special proteins inside or on the surface of cells. They can attach to certain substances in your blood, including estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen and progesterone are hormones (chemical messengers in your bloodstream that control the actions of certain cells or organs). These hormones play key roles in a woman's sexual development and reproductive functions. Men also have these hormones, but in much smaller amounts.\n\n**ER/PR Tests**\n\nER/PR tests will show whether there are ER and/or PR receptors on your breast cancer cells. Test results are frequently referred to as the hormone receptor status. The different statuses include:\n\n* **ER-positive (ER+):** Cancers that have estrogen receptors (ER). Most breast cancers are ER-positive.\n* **PR-positive (PR+):** Cancers that have progesterone receptors (PR)\n* **Hormone receptor-positive (HR+):** Cancers with one or both receptor types.\n* **HR-negative (HR-):** Cancers without ER or PR receptors.\n\n**Why Do I Need an ER/PR Test?**\n\nYou may need this test if you've been diagnosed with breast cancer. Knowing your hormone receptor status will help your health care provider decide how to treat it. If you have ER-positive, PR-positive, or HR-positive cancer, medicines that lower hormone levels or stop the hormones from helping cancer to grow can be very effective. If you have HR-negative cancer, these types of medicines won't work for you.\n\n**What Happens During ER/PR Testing?**\n\nYour provider will need to take a sample of your breast tissue in a procedure called a breast biopsy. There are three main types of breast biopsy procedures:\n\n* **Fine needle aspiration biopsy:** uses a very thin needle to remove a sample of breast cells or fluid.\n* **Core needle biopsy:** uses a wide needle to remove one or more small tissue samples about the size of a grain of rice.\n* **Surgical biopsy (or open biopsy):** is surgery to remove all or part of a lump.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYour provider will give you instructions for how to prepare for your biopsy. If you take any blood thinners, including aspirin, you may need to stop taking them before your biopsy. Tell your provider about all the medicines and supplements you take. Don't stop or start taking anything without talking with your provider first.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nIt's common to have some bruising and temporary discomfort after a breast biopsy. Possible risks include:\n\n* **Infection:** which can be treated with antibiotics\n* **Bleeding**\n\nYour provider will give you instructions for how to care for biopsy area and manage any discomfort.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nThe results will show whether you have a hormone receptor-positive or negative type of cancer.\n\nIf your hormone receptor status is positive:\n\n* At least 1% of the cells in your sample have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors.\n* The cancer is using either estrogen or progesterone to grow. The higher the levels of receptors, the more effective certain medicines may be in treating your cancer.\n\nIf your hormone receptor status is negative:\n\n* Less than 1% of the cells in your sample have receptors, so those medicines will not be effective.\n\nIf you have questions about your results, talk to your provider. They may want to do other tests before making a diagnosis and planning the best treatment for you.\n\n---\n\n**Estrogen Receptor, Progesterone Receptor Tests**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is HER2 testing?**\n\nHER2 testing is often done at the same time as ER/PR testing to help guide treatment. HER2 is a protein involved in normal cell growth. It also helps certain types of cancer cells grow quickly. Cancers with large amounts of HER2 protein tend to grow quickly and spread to other parts of the body. Breast cancer cells with higher-than-normal levels of HER2 are called HER2-positive. Certain medicines, called HER2 targeted therapy, can block or slow HER2 proteins and help control these cancers. But these medicines won’t help cancers that don’t have high levels of HER2 proteins. So, HER2 tumor marker testing is necessary to find out if targeted therapy will be helpful.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What are estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) tests?**\n\nEstrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) tests are done on samples of your tissue that contain breast cancer cells.

They are usually done on an outpatient basis, which means you go home the same day:\n\n1.  Fine needle aspiration biopsy or core needle biopsy:\n    *   A small sample of tissue is removed through a thin needle\n2.  Surgical biopsy:\n    *   A larger sample of tissue is removed through surgery\n\n\\n\\n**How do I prepare for the test?**\n\nYour provider will give you instructions for how to prepare for your biopsy. If you take any blood thinners, including aspirin, you may need to stop taking them before your biopsy. Tell your provider about all the medicines and supplements you take. Don't stop or start taking anything without talking with your provider first.\n\nIf you're having general anesthesia, you will probably need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before surgery. If you have general anesthesia or medicine to relax, you may be groggy after the procedure, so plan to have someone take you home.\n\n\\n\\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nIt's common to have some bruising and temporary discomfort after a breast biopsy. Possible risks include:\n\n*   Infection, which can be treated with antibiotics\n*   Bleeding\n\nYour provider will give you instructions for how to care for biopsy area and manage any discomfort. If you're having general anesthesia, talk with your provider about how it may affect you. General anesthesia is very safe even for most people with other health conditions.\n\n\\n\\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nThe results will show whether you have a hormone receptor-positive or negative type of cancer.\n\nIf your hormone receptor status is positive:\n\n*   At least 1% of the cells in your sample have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors.\n*   The cancer is using either estrogen or progesterone to grow.

    "content": "**Estrogen Vaginal**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nVaginal estrogen is used to treat vaginal dryness, itching, and burning in women after menopause. It helps restore the natural balance of hormones in the vagina.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nIn addition to treating vaginal dryness, itching, and burning, vaginal estrogen may also be used to prevent osteoporosis (brittle bones) in postmenopausal women who are at high risk of developing the condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore using vaginal estrogen, tell your doctor if you have or have ever had cancer, especially breast cancer. Also, inform your doctor if you have unusual vaginal bleeding, as this may be a sign of endometrial cancer. Your doctor will watch you closely to ensure you do not develop endometrial cancer during or after treatment.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore vaginal estrogen at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Dispose of the medication properly after use.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you experience any symptoms such as sudden severe headache, vomiting, speech problems, dizziness, or faintness while using vaginal estrogen, call your doctor immediately.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nTo decrease the risk of developing serious health problems while using vaginal estrogen, do not use it alone or with a progestin to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia. Use the lowest dose of estrogen that controls your symptoms and only use vaginal estrogen as long as needed.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Brand names**\n\nVagifem (0.1 mg)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other names**\n\nEstrogen vaginal cream, estrogen vaginal tablets, estrogen vaginal inserts\n\n---\n\n**Estrogen Vaginal: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Using Vaginal Estrogen Safely**\n\nTell your doctor if you are having surgery or will be on bed rest. Your doctor may tell you to stop using vaginal estrogen 4 to 6 weeks before the surgery or bed rest to decrease the risk that you will develop blood clots.\n\nTalk to your doctor regularly about the risks and benefits of using vaginal estrogen.\n\n**Risks of Using Vaginal Estrogen**\n\nEstrogen increases the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the uterus [womb]) during your treatment or up to 15 years after your treatment, if you have not had a hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus [womb]). The longer you use estrogen, the greater the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer. If you have not had a hysterectomy, you may be given another medication called a progestin to take with vaginal estrogen. This may decrease your risk of developing endometrial cancer but may increase your risk of developing certain other health problems, including breast cancer.\n\nIn a large study, women who took estrogen with progestins by mouth had a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots in the lungs or legs, breast cancer, and dementia (loss of ability to think, learn, and understand). Women who use vaginal estrogen alone or with progestins may also have a higher risk of developing these conditions.\n\n**Symptoms to Watch For**\n\nCall your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms while you are using vaginal estrogen:\n\n* Sudden, severe headache\n* Sudden, severe vomiting\n* Speech problems\n* Dizziness or faintness\n* Sudden complete or partial loss of vision\n* Double vision\n* Weakness or numbness of an arm or a leg\n* Crushing chest pain or chest heaviness\n* Coughing up blood\n* Sudden shortness of breath\n* Difficulty thinking clearly, remembering, or learning new things\n* Breast lumps or other breast changes\n* Discharge from nipples\n* Pain, tenderness, or redness in one leg\n\n**Using Vaginal Estrogen Correctly**\n\nYou can take steps to decrease the risk that you will develop a serious health problem while you are using vaginal estrogen. Do not use vaginal estrogen alone or with a progestin to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia. Use the lowest dose of estrogen that controls your symptoms and only use vaginal estrogen as long as needed. Talk to your doctor every 3 to 6 months to decide if you should use a lower dose of estrogen or should stop using the medication.\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nVaginal estrogen is used to treat vaginal dryness, itching, and burning; painful or difficult urination; and sudden need to urinate immediately in women who are experiencing or have experienced menopause (change of life; the end of monthly menstrual periods). Femring brand vaginal ring is also used to treat hot flushes ('hot flashes'; sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating) in women who are experiencing menopause. Premarin brand vaginal cream is also used to treat kraurosis vulvae (a condition that may cause vaginal dryness and discomfort in women or girls of any age). Imvexxy brand vaginal inserts are used for the treatment of dyspareunia (difficult or painful sexual intercourse) in menopausal women. Vaginal estrogen is in a class of medications called hormones. It works by replacing estrogen that is normally produced by the body.\n\n---\n\n**Vaginal Estrogen: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nVaginal estrogen comes in several forms, including a flexible ring, vaginal insert, tablet to insert in the vagina, and cream to apply to the inside of the vagina.

    "content": "**Estrogen and Bazedoxifene**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nEstrogen and bazedoxifene are used to treat menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness. They may also be used to prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nTaking estrogen increases the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the uterus [womb]) during your treatment or up to 15 years after your treatment, if you have not had a hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus [womb]). The longer you take estrogen, the greater the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer. Taking bazedoxifene along with estrogen may decrease the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer. Do not take any other medications that contain estrogen during your treatment because this may increase the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer.\n\nIn a large study, women who take estrogen had a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots in the lungs or legs, breast cancer, and dementia (loss of ability to think, learn, and understand) than women who do not take estrogen. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had blood clots or breast cancer, if you have had a heart attack or a stroke, or if you have any condition that increases the risk that you will develop blood clots.\n\nThe following symptoms can be signs of the serious health conditions listed above. Call your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms while you are taking estrogen and bazedoxifene: sudden, severe headache; sudden, severe vomiting; speech problems; dizziness or faintness; sudden complete or partial loss of vision; double vision; weakness or numbness of an arm or a leg; crushing chest pain or chest heaviness; coughing up blood; sudden shortness of breath; difficulty thinking clearly, remembering, or learning new things; breast lumps or other breast changes; discharge from nipples; or pain, tenderness, or redness in one leg.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you miss a dose of estrogen and bazedoxifene, take it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule. Do not take extra doses.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nCommon side effects of estrogen and bazedoxifene include breast tenderness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, bloating, weight gain, changes in menstrual cycle, vaginal bleeding or spotting, dizziness, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, back pain, and sleep disturbances.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore estrogen and bazedoxifene at room temperature (59°F to 86°F) in a tightly closed container.

Your doctor will tell you how to properly examine your breasts and whether you should have these exams more often than once a year because of your personal or family medical history.\n\nTell your doctor if you are having surgery or will be on bed rest. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking estrogen and bazedoxifene 4 to 6 weeks before the surgery or bed rest to decrease the risk that you will develop blood clots.

Estrogen and bazedoxifene should not be used to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia. Taking the lowest dose of estrogen that controls your symptoms and only taking estrogen as long as needed can help reduce these risks.

    "content": "**Estrogen and Progestin (Transdermal Patch Contraceptives)**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nEstrogen and progestin transdermal (patch) contraceptives are used to prevent pregnancy. Estrogen (ethinyl estradiol) and progestin (levonorgestrel or norelgestromin) are two female sex hormones. Combinations of estrogen and progestin work by preventing ovulation (the release of eggs from the ovaries) and by changing the cervical mucus and the lining of the uterus.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nTransdermal estrogen and progestin contraceptives come as a patch to apply to the skin. One patch is applied once a week for 3 weeks, followed by a patch-free week. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\n*   Apply your first patch on the first day of your menstrual period.\n*   When changing your patch, always apply your new patch on the same day of the week (the Patch Change Day).\n*   Apply a new patch once a week for 3 weeks. During Week 4, remove the old patch but do not apply a new patch, and expect to begin your menstrual period.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nCigarette smoking increases the risk of serious side effects from the contraceptive patch, including heart attacks, blood clots, and strokes. This risk is higher for women over 35 years old and heavy smokers (15 or more cigarettes per day) and in women who have a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or more.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you are just starting to use the Twirla brand estrogen and progestin contraceptive patch, you should apply your first patch on the first day of your menstrual period. If you are just starting to use the Xulane brand estrogen and progestin contraceptive patch, you may apply your first patch on the first day of your menstrual period or on the first Sunday after your period begins.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nThe most common side effects include:\n\n*   Spotting or light bleeding during the first few months\n*   Breast tenderness\n*   Headache\n*   Dizziness\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n\nLess common side effects may include:\n\n*   Vaginal discharge\n*   Changes in menstrual flow\n*   Bloating\n*   Fatigue\n*   Mood changes\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore the contraceptive patch at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Do not store the patch in the bathroom or near a window.\n\nDispose of used patches by folding them in half so that they stick to themselves and placing them in a trash can out of reach of children and pets.\n\n---\n\n**Estrogen and Progestin (Transdermal Patch Contraceptives)**\n\n**How to Use**\n\nTo ensure effective use, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check your patch daily**: Verify that the patch is sticking properly.\n2. **Reapply for less than a day**: If the patch has been partially or completely detached for less than one day, try to reapply it in the same place immediately.\n3. **Replace with a new patch**: Do not attempt to reapply a patch that is no longer sticky, stuck to itself or another surface, or has material attached to its surface.\n\n**Detachment and Replacement**\n\n* If the patch has been partially or completely detached for more than one day, or if you're unsure how long it's been detached:\n\t+ You may not be protected from pregnancy.\n\t+ Start a new cycle by applying a new patch immediately; the day you apply the new patch becomes your new Patch Change Day.\n\t+ Use backup birth control for the first week of the new cycle.\n\n**Irritation and Replacement**\n\n* If the skin under your patch becomes irritated:\n\t+ Remove the old patch.\n\t+ Apply a new patch to a different spot on the skin.\n\t+ Leave the new patch in place until your regular Patch Change Day.\n\n**General Directions**\n\n* Each brand of estrogen and progestin contraceptive patches should be applied following specific directions given in the manufacturer's information for the patient.\n* Read this information carefully before starting use and each time you refill your prescription.\n* Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.\n\n---\n\n**Using Your Contraceptive Patch**\n\nTo use the Twirla brand estrogen and progestin contraceptive patch, apply your first patch on the first day of your menstrual period. If you are just starting to use the Xulane brand estrogen and progestin contraceptive patch, you may apply your first patch on the first day of your menstrual period or on the first Sunday after your period begins.\n\nIf you apply your first patch after the first day of your menstrual period, you must use a backup method of birth control (such as a condom and/or a spermicide) for the first 7 days of the first cycle. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist to find out when in your cycle you should start using your contraceptive patch.\n\n**Changing Your Patch**\n\nWhen changing your patch, always apply your new patch on the same day of the week (the Patch Change Day). Apply a new patch once a week for 3 weeks. During Week 4, remove the old patch but do not apply a new patch, and expect to begin your menstrual period.\n\nOn the day after Week 4 ends, apply a new patch to start a new 4-week cycle even if your menstrual period has not started or has not ended. You should not go more than 7 days without a patch.\n\n**Applying Your Patch**\n\nApply the contraceptive patch to a clean, dry, intact, healthy area of skin on the buttock, abdomen, upper outer arm, or upper torso, in a place where it will not be rubbed by tight clothing. Do not place the contraceptive patch on the breasts or on skin that is red, irritated, or cut.\n\nDo not apply makeup, creams, lotions, powders, or other topical products to the skin area where the contraceptive patch is placed. Each new patch should be applied to a new spot on the skin to help avoid irritation.\n\n**Removing Your Patch**\n\nIf the patch has been partially or completely detached for less than one day, try to reapply it in the same place immediately. Do not try to reapply a patch that is no longer sticky, that has stuck to itself or another surface, that has any material stuck to its surface or that has loosened or fallen off before.\n\nApply a new patch instead. Your Patch Change Day will stay the same. If the patch has been partially or completely detached for more than one day, or if you do not know how long the patch has been detached, you may not be protected from pregnancy.\n\nYou must start a new cycle by applying a new patch immediately; the day that you apply the new patch becomes your new Patch Change Day. Use backup birth control for the first week of the new cycle.\n\n**Special Precautions**\n\nBefore using an estrogen and progestin contraceptive patch, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to estrogens, progestins, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in estrogen and progestin contraceptive patches. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n\nTell your doctor if you are using any other type of hormonal birth control, such as pills, rings, injections, or implants.

    "content": "**Estrogen and Progestin (Vaginal Ring Contraceptives)**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nEstrogen and progestin vaginal ring contraceptives are used to prevent pregnancy. Estrogen (ethinyl estradiol) and progestin (etonogestrel or segesterone) are two female sex hormones. Estrogen and progestin are in a class of medications called combination hormonal contraceptives (birth control medications). Combinations of estrogen and progestin work by preventing ovulation (the release of eggs from the ovaries). They also change the lining of the uterus (womb) to prevent pregnancy from developing and change the mucus at the cervix (opening of the uterus) to prevent sperm (male reproductive cells) from entering. Contraceptive vaginal rings are a very effective method of birth control, but they do not prevent the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]) and other sexually transmitted diseases.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nEstrogen and progestin vaginal ring contraceptives come as a flexible ring to place in the vagina. The estrogen and progestin vaginal ring contraceptives are usually placed in the vagina and left in place for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks using the vaginal ring, remove the ring for a 1-week break. After using the Annovera® vaginal ring for 3 weeks, clean it with mild soap and warm water, pat it dry with a clean cloth or paper towel, and then place it in the provided case during the 1 week break. After using the NuvaRing® vaginal ring for 3 weeks, you may dispose of it and insert a new vaginal ring after the 1 week break.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nCigarette smoking increases the risk of serious side effects from estrogen and progestin vaginal ring, including heart attacks, blood clots, and strokes. This risk is higher for women over 35 years of age and heavy smokers (15 or more cigarettes per day). If you use estrogen and progestin, you should not smoke.\n\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nNone specified.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nInsert your vaginal ring at the same time every week, even if you have not stopped bleeding. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nSide effects may include changes in menstrual periods, spotting or breakthrough bleeding, nausea, breast tenderness, headache, dizziness, vaginal discharge, and pelvic pain. If you experience any of these symptoms, contact your healthcare provider for guidance.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore the contraceptive ring in its original packaging at room temperature (59°F to 86°F) away from moisture and light. Do not store the vaginal ring in a bathroom or near a sink. Dispose of used NuvaRing® vaginal rings by throwing them away in a trash can with a lid.\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you experience any severe side effects, such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe dizziness, seek immediate medical attention.\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nDifferent brands of contraceptive rings contain slightly different medications or doses, are used in slightly different ways, and have different risks and benefits. Be sure that you know which brand of contraceptive vaginal ring you are using and exactly how you should use it. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient and read it carefully.\n\n**Brand names of combination products**\n\nAnnovera, NuvaRing\n\n**Other names**\n\nEstrogen and progestin vaginal ring contraceptives\n\n---\n\n**Estrogen and Progestin (Vaginal Ring Contraceptives) - MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Using Your Vaginal Ring**\n\nIf your Annovera(r) contraceptive vaginal ring falls out, wash it with mild soap and warm water, rinse and pat dry with a clean cloth towel or paper towel, and try to replace it within 2 hours. If your vaginal ring is out of place for more than a total of 2 hours over the cycle of 3 weeks that the vaginal ring is to be inserted (e.g., from falling out one time or several times), you must use a non-hormonal backup method of birth control (e.g., condoms with spermicide) until you have had the ring in place for 7 days in a row.\n\nRegularly check for the presence of the vaginal ring in the vagina before and after intercourse.\n\nContraceptive vaginal rings will work only as long as they are used regularly. Do not stop using contraceptive vaginal rings without talking to your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Inserting Your First Vaginal Ring**\n\nYour doctor will tell you when you should insert your first contraceptive vaginal ring. This depends on whether you were using another type of birth control in the past month, were not using birth control, or have recently given birth or had an abortion or miscarriage. In some cases, you may need to use an additional method of birth control for the first 7 days that you use the contraceptive ring. Your doctor will tell you whether you need to use backup birth control and will help you choose a method, such as male condoms and/or spermicides. You should not use a diaphragm, cervical cap, or a female condom when a contraceptive ring is in place.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Using Different Brands of Vaginal Rings**\n\nContraceptive vaginal rings come in different brands. Different brands of contraceptive rings contain slightly different medications or doses, are used in slightly different ways, and have different risks and benefits. Be sure that you know which brand of contraceptive vaginal ring you are using and exactly how you should use it. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient and read it carefully.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Annovera(r) Vaginal Ring Instructions**\n\nIf you are using the Annovera(r) vaginal ring, re-insert the clean vaginal ring after the 1-week break; repeat the cycle of 3 weeks of use with a 1-week break for up to 13 cycles. After using the Annovera(r) vaginal ring for 3 weeks, clean it with mild soap and warm water, pat it dry with a clean cloth or paper towel, and then place it in the provided case during the 1 week break.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**NuvaRing(r) Vaginal Ring Instructions**\n\nIf you are using the NuvaRing(r) vaginal ring, insert a new ring after the 1-week break; repeat the cycle of 3 weeks of use with a 1-week break, using a new vaginal ring for each cycle. If your NuvaRing(r) contraceptive ring slips out, you should rinse it with cool or lukewarm (not hot) water and try to replace it within 3 hours. However, if your NuvaRing(r) contraceptive ring slips out and it is broken, discard it and replace it with a new vaginal ring. If your ring falls out and gets lost, you should replace it with a new ring and remove the new ring at the same time you were scheduled to remove the ring that was lost.\n\n---\n\n**Estrogen and Progestin (Vaginal Ring Contraceptives)**\n\n**How to Use the Vaginal Ring**\n\n*   The contraceptive ring will usually stay in your vagina until you remove it.\n*   It may sometimes slip out when you are removing a tampon, during intercourse, or having a bowel movement. Call your doctor if your contraceptive ring slips out often.\n\n**Replacing the Vaginal Ring**\n\n*   If your NuvaRing(r) contraceptive ring slips out, rinse it with cool or lukewarm (not hot) water and try to replace it within 3 hours.\n*   If your NuvaRing(r) contraceptive ring slips out and it is broken, discard it and replace it with a new vaginal ring.\n*   If your ring falls out and gets lost, replace it with a new ring and remove the new ring at the same time you were scheduled to remove the ring that was lost.\n\n**Backup Method of Birth Control**\n\n*   If you do not replace your NuvaRing(r) vaginal ring within the appropriate time, use a non-hormonal backup method of birth control (e.g., condoms with spermicide) until you have had the ring in place for 7 days in a row.\n\n**Annovera Contraceptive Vaginal Ring**\n\n*   If your Annovera contraceptive vaginal ring falls out, wash it with mild soap and warm water, rinse and pat dry with a clean cloth towel or paper towel, and try to replace it within 2 hours.\n*   If your vaginal ring is out of place for more than a total of 2 hours over the cycle of 3 weeks that the vaginal ring is to be inserted (e.g., from falling out one time or several times), use a non-hormonal backup method of birth control (e.g., condoms with spermicide) until you have had the ring in place for 7 days in a row.\n\n**Regular Check-Ups**\n\n*   Regularly check for the presence of the vaginal ring in the vagina before and after intercourse.\n\n**Important Information**\n\n*   Contraceptive vaginal rings will work only as long as they are used regularly.

Estrogen and progestin patches are also used to prevent thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) in menopausal women.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nYour doctor will select the product that is best to treat your condition. Hormone replacement therapy works by replacing hormones that are no longer being made by the body. Estrogen reduces hot flashes (feelings of warmth in the upper body and periods of sweating and heat), vaginal symptoms (itching, burning, and dryness) and difficulty with urination. Progestin is added to estrogen in hormone replacement therapy to reduce the risk of uterine cancer when the uterus is still present.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nEstrogen and progestin transdermal patches are used to treat certain conditions in women before they reach menopause if they are not making these hormones naturally.

Call your doctor immediately.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nTake the lowest dose of estrogen that controls your symptoms and only take estrogen as long as needed. Talk to your doctor every 3 to 6 months to decide if you should take a lower dose of estrogen or should stop taking the medication. Examine your breasts every month and have a mammogram and breast exam performed by a doctor every year to help detect breast cancer as early as possible.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Brand names**\n\nEstrogen is available under several brand names, including Premarin.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Brand names of combination products**\n\nEstrogen may be combined with other medications, such as progestins, to prevent certain health problems.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other names**\n\nEstrogen is also known by its generic name, estradiol.\n\n---\n\n**Estrogen: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Warning Signs of Serious Health Conditions**\n\nCall your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms while taking estrogen:\n\n* Sudden, severe headache\n* Sudden, severe vomiting\n* Speech problems\n* Dizziness or faintness\n* Sudden complete or partial loss of vision\n* Double vision\n* Weakness or numbness of an arm or a leg\n* Crushing chest pain or chest heaviness\n* Coughing up blood\n* Sudden shortness of breath\n* Difficulty thinking clearly, remembering, or learning new things\n* Breast lumps or other breast changes\n* Discharge from nipples\n* Pain, tenderness, or redness in one leg\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Decreasing the Risk of Serious Health Problems**\n\nTo decrease the risk that you will develop a serious health problem while taking estrogen:\n\n* Do not take estrogen alone or with a progestin to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia.\n* Take the lowest dose of estrogen that controls your symptoms and only take estrogen as long as needed.\n* Talk to your doctor every 3 to 6 months to decide if you should take a lower dose of estrogen or should stop taking the medication.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Examining Your Breasts**\n\nYou should examine your breasts every month and have a mammogram and a breast exam performed by a doctor every year to help detect breast cancer as early as possible. Your doctor will tell you how to properly examine your breasts and whether you should have these exams more often than once a year because of your personal or family medical history.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nEstrogen is used to treat hot flushes ('hot flashes'; sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating) in women who are experiencing menopause ('change of life', the end of monthly menstrual periods). Some brands of estrogen are also used to treat vaginal dryness, itching, or burning, or to prevent osteoporosis (a condition in which the bones become thin and weak and break easily) in women who are experiencing or have experienced menopause. However, women who need a medication only to treat vaginal dryness or only to prevent osteoporosis should consider a different treatment. Some brands of estrogen are also to relieve symptoms of low estrogen in young women who do not produce enough estrogen naturally. Some brands of estrogen are also used to relieve the symptoms of certain types of breast and prostate (a male reproductive gland) cancer.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nEstrogen comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once a day. Estrogen is sometimes taken every day and sometimes taken according to a rotating schedule that alternates a period of time when estrogen is taken every day with a period of time when estrogen is not taken. When estrogen is used to relieve the symptoms of cancer, it is usually taken three times a day. Take estrogen at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take estrogen exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYour doctor may start you on a low dose of estrogen and gradually increase your dose if your symptoms are still bothersome, or decrease your dose if your symptoms are well-controlled. Talk to your doctor about how well estrogen works for you.\n\n---\n\n**Estrogen: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/5)**\n\n**How Should This Medicine Be Used?**\n\n*   Estrogen comes as a tablet to take by mouth.\n*   It is usually taken with or without food once a day.\n*   Take estrogen at around the same time(s) every day.\n\n**Your Doctor May Start You On A Low Dose Of Estrogen And Gradually Increase Your Dose If Your Symptoms Are Still Bothersome, Or Decrease Your Dose If Your Symptoms Are Well-Controlled.

    "content": "**Eszopiclone: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 1/4)**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nEszopiclone is used to treat insomnia (difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep). Eszopiclone is in a class of medications called hypnotics. It works by slowing activity in the brain to allow sleep.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nEszopiclone comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day at bedtime or after unsuccessfully trying to fall asleep. Do not take eszopiclone with or shortly after a heavy, high-fat meal. Eszopiclone may not work well if it is taken with high fat foods. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take eszopiclone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nYou will probably become very sleepy soon after you take eszopiclone and will remain sleepy for some time after you take the medication. You should only take eszopiclone immediately before you go to bed or after you have gone to bed and have been unable to fall asleep. Only take eszopiclone if you will be able to stay in bed for at least 7 to 8 hours after taking the medication. If you do not go to bed right after you take eszopiclone or if you get up too soon after taking eszopiclone, you may experience dizziness, lightheadedness, hallucinations (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist), and problems with coordination and memory.\n\nYour doctor may change your dose of eszopiclone during your treatment. Your doctor may increase your dose to help you sleep better or decrease your dose if you are too drowsy during the daytime.\n\nYou should be sleeping well within 7 to 10 days after you start taking eszopiclone. Call your doctor if your sleep problems do not improve during this time, if they get worse at any time during your treatment, or if you notice any changes in your thoughts or behavior.\n\nDo not stop taking eszopiclone without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking eszopiclone you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, unusual dreams, stomach and muscle cramps, nausea, vomiting, sweating, shakiness, and rarely, seizures.\n\nAfter you stop taking eszopiclone, you may have more difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep than you did before you took the medication. These sleep problems are normal and usually get better without treatment after one or two nights.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nTell your doctor if you have ever had an unusual sleep behavior while taking eszopiclone. Be sure that your family or caregiver are aware that these symptoms are serious and to call your doctor if they occur. Stop taking eszopiclone and call your doctor right away if you find out that you have been driving or doing anything else unusual while you were sleeping.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you forget to take a dose of eszopiclone, take it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule. Do not take two doses at one time.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nEszopiclone may cause serious or possibly life-threatening sleep behaviors. Some people who took eszopiclone got out of bed and drove their cars, prepared and ate food, had sex, made phone calls, sleep-walked, or were involved in other activities while not fully awake. After they woke up, these people were unable to remember what they had done.\n\nYou may experience dizziness, lightheadedness, hallucinations (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist), and problems with coordination and memory when you take eszopiclone.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep eszopiclone in its original container. Store it at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Do not remove the desiccant packet from the bottle. Keep the bottle tightly closed to prevent moisture from entering.

    "content": "**Etanercept Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 1/7)**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nEtanercept injection is available as several different products that are considered to be biologic medications (medications made from living organisms). These biosimilar products are highly similar to etanercept injection and work the same way as etanercept injection in the body. Therefore, the term etanercept injection products will be used to represent these medications in this discussion.\n\n**Important Warning**\n\nUsing etanercept injection products may decrease your ability to fight infection and increase the risk that you will get a serious infection, including severe viral, bacterial, or fungal infections that spread throughout the body. These infections may need to be treated in a hospital and may cause death.\n\nTell your doctor if you often get any type of infection or if you think you may have any type of infection now. This includes minor infections (such as open cuts or sores), infections that come and go (such as cold sores) and chronic infections that do not go away. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), or any other condition that affects your immune system.\n\nYou should also tell your doctor if you live or have ever lived in areas such as the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys where severe fungal infections are more common. Ask your doctor if you do not know if these infections are common in your area. Also tell your doctor if you are taking medications that decrease the activity of the immune system.\n\n**Monitoring for Signs of Infection**\n\nYour doctor will monitor you for signs of infection during and shortly after your treatment. If you have any of the following symptoms before you begin your treatment or if you experience any of the following symptoms during or shortly after your treatment, call your doctor immediately:\n\n* weakness\n* sweating\n* difficulty breathing\n* sore throat\n* cough\n* coughing up bloody mucus\n* fever\n* weight loss\n* extreme tiredness\n* diarrhea\n* stomach pain\n* flu-like symptoms\n* warm, red, or painful skin\n* or other signs of infection.\n\n---\n\n**Etanercept Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Common Side Effects:** \n    *   breathing problems\n    *   sore throat\n    *   cough\n    *   coughing up bloody mucus\n    *   fever\n    *   weight loss\n    *   extreme tiredness\n    *   diarrhea\n    *   stomach pain\n    *   flu-like symptoms\n    *   warm, red, or painful skin\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Risk of Infection:** \n    *   You may be infected with tuberculosis (TB) or hepatitis B without having any symptoms.\n    *   Etanercept injection products may increase the risk that your infection will become more serious and you will develop symptoms.\n    *   Your doctor will perform a skin test to see if you have an inactive TB infection and may order blood tests to see if you have an inactive hepatitis B infection.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Cancer Risk:** \n    *   Some children and teenagers who received etanercept injection products developed severe or life-threatening cancers, including lymphoma.\n    *   If your child develops any of these symptoms during treatment, call their doctor immediately: unexplained weight loss; swollen glands in the neck, underarms, or groin; or easy bruising or bleeding.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Medication Guide:** \n    *   Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with etanercept injection products and each time you refill your prescription.\n    *   Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Talk to Your Doctor:** \n    *   Using etanercept injection products may decrease your ability to fight infection and increase the risk that you will get a serious infection, including severe viral, bacterial, or fungal infections that spread throughout the body.\n    *   Tell your doctor if you often get any type of infection or if you think you may have any type of infection now.\n\n---\n\n**Etanercept Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nEtanercept injection products are used alone or with other medications to treat:\n\n* Rheumatoid arthritis (a condition in which the body attacks its own joints, causing pain, swelling, and loss of function) in adults.\n* Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PJIA; a type of childhood arthritis that affects five or more joints during the first six months of the condition, causing pain, swelling, and loss of function) in children 2 years of age or older.\n* Psoriatic arthritis (a condition that causes joint pain and swelling and scales on the skin) in adults and children 2 years of age or older.\n* Ankylosing spondylitis (condition in which the body attacks the joints of the spine and other areas causing pain and joint damage) in adults.\n* Chronic plaque psoriasis (a skin disease in which red, scaly patches form on some areas of the body) in adults and children 4 years of age and older whose psoriasis is too severe to be treated by topical medications alone.\n\nEtanercept is in a class of medications called tumor-necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of TNF, a substance in the body that causes inflammation.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nEtanercept injection products come as a solution (liquid) in single-dose, prefilled syringes, dosing pens, cartridges, automatic injection devices, and vials. Etanercept is injected subcutaneously (under the skin).

    "content": "**Etelcalcetide Injection**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nEtelcalcetide injection is used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism (condition in which the body produces too much parathyroid hormone [PTH; natural substance needed to control the amount of calcium in the blood]) in adults with chronic kidney disease (condition in which the kidneys stop working slowly and gradually) who are being treated with dialysis (medical treatment to clean the blood when the kidneys are not working properly.) Etelcalcetide injection is in a class of medications called calcimimetics. It works by signaling the body to produce less parathyroid hormone in order to decrease the amount of calcium in the blood.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nEtelcalcetide injection comes as a solution (liquid) to inject intravenously (into a vein). It is usually given 3 times a week at the end of each dialysis session by a doctor or nurse at the dialysis center. Your doctor will probably start you on an average dose of etelcalcetide injection and gradually adjust your dose depending on your body's response to the medication, not more than once every 4 weeks.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore receiving etelcalcetide injection, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to etelcalcetide, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in etelcalcetide injection.

    "content": "**Ethinyl Estradiol and Desogestrel (Oral Contraceptive)**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nOral contraceptives (birth-control pills) containing ethinyl estradiol (an estrogen) and desogestrel (a progestin) are used to prevent pregnancy. Estrogen and progestin are two female sex hormones. Combinations of estrogen and progestin work by preventing ovulation (the release of eggs from the ovaries).\n\nOral contraceptives are an effective method of birth control, but they do not prevent the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]) and other sexually transmitted diseases.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nEthinyl estradiol and desogestrel oral contraceptives come as tablets to take by mouth. Take once a day on the days specified by your doctor. Take your oral contraceptive at the same time on those days.\n\nTake ethinyl estradiol and desogestrel oral contraceptives exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nOral contraceptives come in many different brands. Different brands of oral contraceptives contain different doses and may also contain inactive tablets or ones containing iron. Oral contraceptives are taken on specific schedules. Be sure that you know which brand of oral contraceptives you are using and exactly how you should use it. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient and read it carefully.\n\nYour doctor will tell you when you should start taking your oral contraceptive. It is usually started on the first day of your menstrual period or on the first Sunday after bleeding begins. You will probably be told to use another method of birth control during the first 7 days that you take your oral contraceptive. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about what method is best for you. Follow these directions carefully to prevent pregnancy.\n\nYou will probably experience withdrawal bleeding similar to a menstrual period while you are taking the inactive tablets or during the time that you do not take your oral contraceptive. If you are taking the type of packet that only contains active tablets, you will not experience any scheduled bleeding, but you may experience unexpected bleeding and spotting, especially at the beginning of your treatment. Be sure to start taking your new packet on schedule even if you are still bleeding.\n\nIf you vomit or have diarrhea while you are taking ethinyl estradiol and desogestrel oral contraceptive, it may not work as well. If this happens, contact your doctor about what to do. You may be told to use a back-up method for 7 days. Talk to your doctor about an appropriate backup method of birth control in case it is needed at any point during therapy.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nEthinyl estradiol and desogestrel oral contraceptives may cause heart attacks, blood clots, and strokes. Tell your doctor if you smoke cigarettes or are over 35 years of age or if you have or have ever had blood clots in your legs, lungs, or eyes; conditions in which the blood clots easily; coronary artery disease (clogged blood vessels leading to the heart); cerebrovascular disease (clogging or weakening of the blood vessels within the brain or leading to the brain); a stroke or mini-stroke; an irregular heartbeat; heart or heart valve disease; a heart attack; or chest pain. Your doctor will probably tell you that you should not take ethinyl estradiol and desogestrel oral contraceptives.\n\nIf you experience any of the following symptoms while receiving ethinyl estradiol and desogestrel, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: shortness of breath, leg pain, sudden chest pain, sudden severe headache, sudden changes in vision, weakness or numbness in an arm or leg, trouble speaking.\n\n---\n\n**Ethinyl Estradiol and Desogestrel (Oral Contraceptive)**\n\n*   **MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n*   **Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**How Should This Medicine Be Used?**\n\n*   Continue to take ethinyl estradiol and desogestrel oral contraceptives as directed even if you are spotting or bleeding, have an upset stomach, or do not think that you are likely to become pregnant.\n*   Take once a day on the days specified by your doctor. Take your oral contraceptive at the same time on those days.\n\n**Other Uses for This Medicine**\n\n*   Oral contraceptives are also sometimes used to treat heavy or irregular menstruation and endometriosis (a condition in which the type of tissue that lines the uterus [womb] grows in other areas of the body and causes pain, heavy or irregular menstruation [periods], and other symptoms).\n*   Oral contraceptives are also used to treat acne in certain patients.\n\n---\n\n**Ethinyl Estradiol and Desogestrel (Oral Contraceptive)**\n\n\\n\\n**Uses**\n\nOral contraceptives are used to prevent pregnancy.

Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.\n\nOral contraceptives are also used to treat acne in certain patients.

    "content": "**Ethinyl Estradiol and Drosperinone (Oral Contraceptive)**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nOral contraceptives (birth-control pills) containing ethinyl estradiol (an estrogen) and drospirenone (a progestin) are used to prevent pregnancy, treat certain types of acne, and to relieve the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (symptoms that occur before the menstrual period each month). Your doctor will select the best medication for your needs. Estrogen and progestin are two female sex hormones. Combinations of estrogen and progestin work by preventing ovulation (the release of eggs from the ovaries). Oral contraceptives treat acne by decreasing the amounts of certain natural substances in the body that can cause acne.\n\nOral contraceptives are an effective method of birth control, but they do not prevent the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]) and other sexually transmitted diseases.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nEthinyl estradiol and drospirenone oral contraceptives come as tablets to take by mouth. Take once a day on the days specified by your doctor. Take your oral contraceptive at the same time on those days.\n\nTake ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone oral contraceptives exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nOral contraceptives come in many different brands. Different brands of oral contraceptives contain different doses and may also contain inactive tablets or ones containing iron. Oral contraceptives are taken on specific schedules. Be sure that you know which brand of oral contraceptives you are using and exactly how you should use it. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient and read it carefully.\n\nYour doctor will tell you when you should start taking your oral contraceptive. It is usually started on the first day of your menstrual period or on the first Sunday after bleeding begins. You will probably be told to use another method of birth control during the first 7 days that you take your oral contraceptive. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about what method is best for you. Follow these directions carefully to prevent pregnancy.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nEthinyl estradiol and drospirenone oral contraceptives may cause heart attacks, blood clots, and strokes. Tell your doctor if you smoke cigarettes or are over 35 years of age or if you have or have ever had blood clots in your legs, lungs, or eyes; conditions in which the blood clots easily; coronary artery disease (clogged blood vessels leading to the heart); cerebrovascular disease (clogging or weakening of the blood vessels within the brain or leading to the brain); a stroke or mini-stroke; an irregular heartbeat; heart or heart valve disease; a heart attack; or chest pain. Your doctor will probably tell you that you should not take ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone oral contraceptives.\n\nIf you experience any of the following symptoms while receiving ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: shortness of breath, leg pain, sudden chest pain, sudden severe headache, sudden changes in vision, weakness or numbness in an arm or leg, trouble speaking.\n\n---\n\n**Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone Oral Contraceptive**\n\nYou will probably experience withdrawal bleeding similar to a menstrual period while you are taking the inactive tablets or during the time that you do not take your oral contraceptive. If you are taking the type of packet that only contains active tablets, you will not experience any scheduled bleeding, but you may experience unexpected bleeding and spotting, especially at the beginning of your treatment. Be sure to start taking your new packet on schedule even if you are still bleeding.\n\nIf you vomit or have diarrhea while you are taking ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone oral contraceptive, it may not work as well. If this happens, contact your doctor about what to do. You may be told to use a back-up method for 7 days. Talk to your doctor about an appropriate backup method of birth control in case it is needed at any point during therapy.\n\nEthinyl estradiol and drospirenone oral contraceptives will work only as long as they are taken regularly. Continue to take them as directed even if you are spotting or bleeding, have an upset stomach, or do not think that you are likely to become pregnant. Do not stop taking oral contraceptives without talking to your doctor.\n\n**How Should This Medicine Be Used?**\n\nEthinyl estradiol and drospirenone oral contraceptives come as tablets to take by mouth.

Estrogen and progestin work mainly by preventing ovulation (the release of eggs from the ovaries). Oral contraceptives are an effective method of birth control, but they do not prevent the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]) and other sexually transmitted diseases.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nEthinyl estradiol and norethindrone oral contraceptives come in tablets, chewable tablets, oral disintegrating tablets, or capsules to take by mouth.

It does not have color or odor. It tastes sweet. Ethylene glycol is poisonous. People sometimes drink ethylene glycol by mistake or on purpose as a substitute for drinking alcohol or when attempting suicide.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is needed.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel slight pain. Others feel a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is ordered when a health care provider thinks someone has been poisoned by ethylene glycol. Suspected ethylene glycol poisoning, usually due to drinking it, is a medical emergency. Ethylene glycol can damage the brain, liver, kidneys, and lungs. The poisoning disturbs the body's chemistry and can lead to a condition called metabolic acidosis. In severe cases, shock, organ failure, and death can result.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThere should be no ethylene glycol present in the blood.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal results are a sign of possible ethylene glycol poisoning.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk in having your blood taken.

    "content": "**Ethylmalonic Encephalopathy**\n\n_Ethylmalonic encephalopathy is an inherited disorder that affects several body systems, particularly the nervous system._\n\n**Description**\n\n* Delayed development and loss of previously acquired skills (developmental regression)\n* Weak muscle tone (hypotonia)\n* Seizures\n* Abnormal movements\n* Rashes of tiny red spots (petechiae) caused by bleeding under the skin\n* Blue discoloration in the hands and feet due to reduced oxygen in the blood (acrocyanosis)\n* Chronic diarrhea\n\nThe signs and symptoms of ethylmalonic encephalopathy are apparent at birth or begin in the first few months of life. Problems with the nervous system typically worsen over time, and most affected individuals survive only into early childhood.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAbout 70 individuals with this condition have been identified worldwide, mostly in Mediterranean and Arab populations. Although ethylmalonic encephalopathy appears to be very rare, researchers suggest that some cases have been misdiagnosed as other neurological disorders.\n\n**Causes**\n\nEthylmalonic encephalopathy results from mutations in the ETHE1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is active in mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers in cells. The ETHE1 enzyme is part of a pathway that breaks down sulfide (H2S), a molecule that is critical at very low levels for normal cell functioning but is toxic at high levels. Excess sulfide interferes with numerous cell activities, including mitochondrial energy production.\n\nMutations in the ETHE1 gene lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of the enzyme or prevent any enzyme from being made. A shortage of functional ETHE1 enzyme prevents sulfide from being broken down, allowing this molecule to accumulate in cells. The buildup of sulfide interferes with the ability of mitochondria to produce energy and damages tissues and organs throughout the body. Researchers believe that the effects of excess sulfide in the brain, muscles, blood vessels, and lining of the intestines underlie most of the major features of ethylmalonic encephalopathy.\n\n---\n\n**Ethylmalonic Encephalopathy**\n\n**What is Ethylmalonic Encephalopathy?**\n\nEthylmalonic encephalopathy is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ETHE1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that breaks down sulfide (H2S), a molecule critical at low levels for normal cell functioning but toxic at high levels.\n\n**How Does Ethylmalonic Encephalopathy Affect the Body?**\n\nMutations in the ETHE1 gene lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of the enzyme or prevent any enzyme from being made. This shortage of functional ETHE1 enzyme prevents sulfide from being broken down, allowing it to accumulate in cells. The buildup of sulfide interferes with the ability of mitochondria to produce energy and damages tissues and organs throughout the body.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nEncephalopathy, petechiae, and ethylmalonic aciduria (EPEMA syndrome)\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Ethylmalonic encephalopathy\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Ethylmalonic encephalopathy\n*   Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: ENCEPHALOPATHY, ETHYLMALONIC; EE\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed: Various studies on ethylmalonic encephalopathy\n\n**References**\n\n1.

It is caused by mutations in the ETHE1 gene, which encodes a mitochondrial matrix protein.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nThe symptoms of ethylmalonic encephalopathy include:\n\n* Severe developmental delay\n* Microcephaly (small head size)\n* Blue discoloration of the skin due to sulfide toxicity\n* Petechiae (small spots on the skin)\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through genetic testing, which detects mutations in the ETHE1 gene.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nEthylmalonic encephalopathy is caused by mutations in the ETHE1 gene. These mutations can be inherited from parents or occur spontaneously during fetal development.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for ethylmalonic encephalopathy, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. This may include:\n\n* Providing supportive care to manage developmental delay and other symptoms\n* Monitoring for sulfide toxicity and taking steps to prevent it\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with ethylmalonic encephalopathy is generally poor. Most children with this disorder do not survive beyond early childhood.\n\n**Genetic Information**\n\nEthylmalonic encephalopathy is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that a child must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition. Carriers of the mutated gene may be at risk for passing it on to their children.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Genetic Brain Disorders\n* Genetic Disorders\n* Mitochondrial Diseases\n* Newborn Screening",

    "content": "**Etidronate**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nEtidronate is used to treat Paget's disease of bone (a condition in which the bones are soft and weak and may be deformed, painful, or easily broken) and to prevent and treat heterotopic ossification (growth of bone tissue in an area of the body other than the skeleton) in people who have had total hip replacement surgery (surgery to replace the hip joint with an artificial joint) or in people who have had an injury to the spinal cord.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nEtidronate comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day on an empty stomach. Treatment for Paget's disease may be repeated if symptoms come back or worsen after some time has passed. Take etidronate at around the same time(s) every day.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nTell your doctor if you do not understand, you do not think you will remember, or you are unable to follow these instructions:\n\n*   Swallow the tablets with a full glass (6 to 8 ounces [180 to 240 mL]) of plain water while you are sitting or standing.\n*   Sit or stand upright after taking etidronate.\n*   Do not eat, drink, or take any other medications (including vitamins or antacids) for 2 hours before and 2 hours after you take etidronate.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you are taking etidronate to treat Paget's disease of bone or to prevent or treat heterotopic ossification, it may take some time for your condition to improve. Do not stop taking etidronate without talking to your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nEtidronate may not work properly and may damage the esophagus (tube that connects the mouth and stomach) or cause sores in the mouth if it is not taken according to the instructions. If you experience any of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore etidronate at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Do not freeze. Dispose of unused or expired tablets properly.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you have taken too much etidronate, contact your doctor or local poison control center immediately. Symptoms of overdose may include difficulty swallowing, pain when swallowing, or difficulty speaking.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nEtidronate is also used sometimes to treat and prevent osteoporosis (condition in which the bones become thin and weak and may break easily) caused by corticosteroids. Talk to your doctor about the possible risks of using this medication for your condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Brand names**\n\nEtidronate is available under the brand name Didronel.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other names**\n\nEtidronate is also known as 1-hydroxyethane-1,1-diphosphonate.\n\n---\n\n**Etidronate: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n\\n\\n**Before Taking Etidronate**\n\n*   Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to etidronate, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in etidronate tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n*   Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking etidronate. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n*   If you are taking vitamin and mineral supplements such as iron, or if you are taking antacids containing calcium, magnesium, or aluminum (Maalox, Mylanta, Tums, others), take them 2 hours before or 2 hours after you take etidronate.\n*   Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had problems with your esophagus such as an esophageal stricture (narrowing of the esophagus that causes swallowing difficulties) or achalasia (disorder which affects the ability of the esophagus to move food toward the stomach), or osteomalacia (softening of bones due to a lack of minerals). Your doctor may tell you not to take etidronate.\n*   Tell your doctor if you are unable to sit or stand upright and if you have or have ever had anemia (condition in which the red blood cells do not bring enough oxygen to all the parts of the body); a low level of calcium in your blood; difficulty swallowing, heartburn, ulcers, or other stomach problems; cancer; enterocolitis (swelling in the intestines); any type of infection, especially in your mouth; problems with your mouth, teeth, or gums; any condition that stops your blood from clotting normally; or kidney disease. Your doctor may need to change the dose of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n*   Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding.

You may begin to feel this pain within days, months, or years after you first take etidronate. Although this type of pain may begin after you have taken etidronate for some time, it is important for you and your doctor to realize that it may be caused by etidronate. Call your doctor right away if you experience severe pain at any time during your treatment with etidronate. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking etidronate and your pain may go away after you stop taking the medication.\n\n**Special Dietary Instructions**\n\n*   There are no special dietary instructions for this medication.\n\n---\n\n**Etidronate: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/4)**\n\n\\n\\n**What special dietary instructions should I follow?**\n\nIt is important that you get enough calcium and vitamin D and eat a balanced diet while you are taking etidronate. Your doctor will tell you which foods are good sources of these nutrients and how many servings you need each day. If you find it difficult to eat enough of these foods, tell your doctor. In that case, your doctor may prescribe or recommend a supplement.\n\n\\n\\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you have not already eaten, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. If you have already eaten, take the missed dose 2 hours after you last ate. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n\\n\\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nEtidronate may cause side effects.
