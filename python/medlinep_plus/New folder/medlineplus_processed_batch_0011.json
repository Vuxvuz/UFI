It begins slowly over many years, first involving the parts of the brain that control thought, memory, and language. The brain changes from the disease lead to symptoms that get worse over time.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPeople with AD may have trouble remembering recent events or the names of people they know. Behavior may vary from person to person and day to day.

This disorder usually appears in people older than age 65, but less common forms of the disease appear earlier in adulthood.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease**\n\n* Memory loss: Forgetfulness may be subtle at first, but the loss of memory worsens over time until it interferes with most aspects of daily living.\n* Difficulty recognizing people and naming objects\n* Routine tasks such as preparing meals, doing laundry, and performing other household chores can be challenging\n* Affected people increasingly require help with dressing, eating, and personal care\n* Personality and behavioral changes: Some people with Alzheimer's disease experience agitation, restlessness, withdrawal, and loss of language skills.\n* Total care is usually required during the advanced stages of the disease.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Survival Rate for Alzheimer's Disease**\n\nIndividuals with Alzheimer's disease usually survive 8 to 10 years after the appearance of symptoms, but the course of the disease can range from 1 to 25 years. Survival is usually shorter in individuals diagnosed after age 80 than in those diagnosed at a younger age.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Classification of Alzheimer's Disease**\n\nAlzheimer's disease can be classified as early-onset or late-onset. The signs and symptoms of the early-onset form appear between a person's thirties and mid-sixties, while the late-onset form appears during or after a person's mid-sixties. The early-onset form of Alzheimer's disease is much less common than the late-onset form, accounting for less than 10 percent of all cases of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n---\n\n**Alzheimer's Disease**\n\n**What is Alzheimer's Disease?**\n\nAlzheimer's disease is a degenerative disease of the brain that causes dementia, which is a gradual loss of memory, judgment, and ability to function.

It is the most common form of dementia among older adults.\n\n**Causes of Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease**\n\nSome cases of early-onset Alzheimer's disease are caused by gene variants (also called mutations) that can be passed from parent to child. This results in what is known as early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Researchers have found that this form of the disorder can result from variants in the APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 genes.\n\n**Genes Associated with Alzheimer's Disease**\n\n*   **APOE**\n*   **APP**\n*   **PSEN1**\n*   **PSEN2**\n\n**Down Syndrome and Alzheimer's Disease**\n\nSome evidence indicates that people with Down syndrome have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. This type of Alzheimer's disease is not inherited.\n\n**Causes of Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease**\n\nThe causes of late-onset Alzheimer's disease are less clear. The late-onset form does not clearly run in families, although clusters of cases have been reported in some families. Alzheimer's disease is probably related to variations in one or more genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern of Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease**\n\nThe inheritance pattern of late-onset Alzheimer's disease is uncertain. People who inherit one copy of the APOE e4 allele have an increased chance of developing the disease; those who inherit two copies of the allele are at even greater risk.\n\n**Early-Onset Familial Alzheimer's Disease**\n\nEarly-onset familial Alzheimer's disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person inherits the altered gene from one affected parent.\n\n---\n\n**Alzheimer's Disease**\n\n**What is Alzheimer's disease?**\n\nAlzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior.\n\n**Causes of Alzheimer's disease**\n\nThe exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is still unknown, but research suggests that it may be related to genetic factors, lifestyle choices, and environmental influences.\n\n**Risk Factors for Alzheimer's Disease**\n\n*   Age: The risk of developing Alzheimer's disease increases with age.\n*   Family History: Having a family history of Alzheimer's disease may increase the risk of developing the condition.\n*   Genetics: Certain genetic mutations, such as APOE e4, can increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.\n\n**Symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease**\n\nThe symptoms of Alzheimer's disease can vary from person to person, but common symptoms include:\n\n*   Memory loss\n*   Confusion and disorientation\n*   Difficulty with communication and language\n*   Mood changes, such as depression or anxiety\n\n**Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease**\n\nDiagnosing Alzheimer's disease can be challenging, as the symptoms may resemble those of other conditions. A diagnosis is typically made through a combination of medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.\n\n**Treatment and Management of Alzheimer's Disease**\n\nThere is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but treatment and management options are available to help slow down the progression of the condition. These may include:\n\n*   Medications: To manage symptoms such as memory loss, confusion, and mood changes.\n*   Lifestyle Changes: Such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, and stress reduction techniques.\n*   Supportive Care: To provide emotional support and practical assistance to individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their families.\n\n**Prognosis of Alzheimer's Disease**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with Alzheimer's disease varies depending on the stage and severity of the condition. With proper treatment and management, some people may be able to slow down the progression of the condition and improve their quality of life.\n\n---\n\n**Alzheimer's Disease**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n*   What is the prognosis of a genetic condition?\n*   How can gene variants affect health and development?\n*   What does it mean if a disorder seems to run in my family?\n*   What are the different ways a genetic condition can be inherited?\n*   How are genetic conditions treated or managed?\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease**\n\nAlzheimer disease is a complex disorder that involves multiple factors, including genetics.

In reality, it is not always easy to know when you are going into labor. The steps leading up to labor can drag on for days.\n\nKeep in mind that your due date is just a general idea of when your labor may start. Normal term labor can start any time between 3 weeks before and 2 weeks after this date.\n\n**False Labor (Braxton Hicks Contractions)**\n\nMost pregnant women feel mild contractions before true labor begins. These are called Braxton Hicks contractions, which:\n\n* May occur at any time after the first trimester of pregnancy\n* Are typically short\n* Are not painful\n* Do not come at regular intervals\n* Are not accompanied by bleeding, leaking fluid, or decreased fetal movement\n* Do not result in cervical changes that suggest the onset of true labor\n\nThis stage is called \"prodromal\" or \"latent\" labor.\n\n**Other Signs That Labor is Near**\n\n* **Lightening**: This happens when your baby's head \"drops\" down into your pelvis.\n\t+ Your belly will look lower. It will be easier for you to breathe because the baby is not putting pressure on your lungs.\n\t+ You may need to urinate more often because the baby is pressing on your bladder.\n\t+ For first-time mothers, lightening often happens a few weeks before birth. For women who have had babies before, it may not happen until labor has begun.\n* **Bloody Show**: If you have bloody or brownish discharge from your vagina, it may mean your cervix has begun to dilate. The mucous plug that sealed your cervix during your pregnancy may be visible. This is a good sign. But active labor may still be days away.\n* **Baby Moves Less**: If you feel less movement, contact your health care provider, as sometimes decreased movement can mean that the baby is in trouble.\n* **Water Breaks**: When the amniotic sac (bag of fluid around the baby) breaks, you will feel fluid leak from your vagina. It may come out in a trickle or a gush.\n\t+ For most women, contractions come within 24 hours after the bag of water breaks.\n\t+ Even if contractions do not begin, let your provider know as soon as you think your water has broken.\n* **Diarrhea**: Some women have the urge to go to the bathroom often to empty their bowels. If this happens and your stools are looser than normal, you may be going into labor.\n* **Nesting**: There is no science behind the theory, but plenty of women feel the sudden urge to \"nest\" right before labor starts. If you feel the need to vacuum the entire house at 3 a.m., or finish your work in the baby's nursery, you may be getting ready for labor.\n\n**True Labor**\n\nIn true labor, your contractions will:\n\n* Come regularly and get closer together (about 5 to 10 minutes apart)\n* Last from 30 to 70 seconds, and will get longer\n* Not stop, no matter what you do\n* Radiate (reach) into your lower back and upper belly\n* Get stronger or become more intense as time goes on\n* Make you unable to talk to other people or laugh at a joke\n\n**When to Call the Doctor or Midwife**\n\nContact your provider right away if you have:\n\n* Leaking amniotic fluid\n* Decreased fetal movement\n* Any vaginal bleeding other than light spotting\n* Regular, painful contractions every 5 to 10 minutes for 60 minutes\n* Contractions lasting 60 to 90 seconds\n\nAlso make contact for any other reason if you are unsure what to do.\n\n---\n\n**Am I in Labor?: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Other Signs That Labor is Near**\n\n*   **Lightening**: This happens when your baby's head \"drops\" down into your pelvis.

The extended-release capsules are usually taken once a day at bedtime.\n\n* Swallow the extended-release capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.\n* If you have difficulty swallowing the extended-release capsule, you may open the capsule and sprinkle the entire contents on a teaspoonful of soft food, like applesauce. Eat the mixture right away and swallow without chewing.\n* Take amantadine at around the same time(s) every day.\n* Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nDo not stop taking amantadine without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking amantadine, you may experience fever, confusion, changes in mental state, or severe muscle stiffness. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nAmantadine extended-release capsules (Gocovri®) are used along with the combination of levodopa and carbidopa (Rytary®, Sinemet®) to treat ''off'' episodes (times of difficulty moving, walking, and speaking that may happen when other medications wear off) in people with Parkinson's disease. It is also used to prevent symptoms of influenza A virus infection and for treatment of respiratory infections caused by influenza A virus.\n\n---\n\n**Amantadine: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking amantadine, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to amantadine, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in amantadine capsules, extended-release capsules, tablets, or liquid.

The child may have parts of both male and female genitals.\n*   **Congenital adrenal hyperplasia**: This condition has several forms, but the most common form causes a genetic female to appear male. Infants are tested for this potentially life-threatening condition during newborn screening exams.\n*   **Chromosomal abnormalities**: Including Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) and Turner syndrome (45,X).\n*   **Medicines taken by the mother**: Certain medicines, such as androgenic steroids, can cause a genetic female to appear more male.\n*   **Lack of production of certain hormones**: This can cause the embryo to develop with a female body type, regardless of genetic sex.\n*   **Androgen insensitivity syndrome**: Even if the body makes the hormones needed to develop into a physical male, the body does not respond normally to those hormones. This may produce female characteristics, even though the genetic sex is male.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if you are concerned about the appearance of your child's external genitalia, or your baby:\n\n*   Takes more than 2 weeks to regain his or her birth weight\n*   Poor feeding or vomiting\n*   Looks dehydrated (dry inside of mouth, no tears when crying, less than 4 wet diapers per 24 hours, eyes look sunken in)\n*   Has a decreased appetite\n*   Has blue spells (may indicate short periods when a reduced amount of blood flows into the lungs)\n*   Has trouble breathing\n\nThese can all be signs of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nThe provider will perform a physical exam which may reveal genitals that are not \"typical male\" or \"typical female,\" but somewhere in between.

It is the most common cause of vision problems in children.\n\n**Causes of Amblyopia**\n\nAmblyopia occurs when the nerve pathway from one eye to the brain does not develop during childhood. This problem develops because the abnormal eye sends the wrong image to the brain. This is the case in strabismus (crossed eyes). In other eye problems, a blurred image is sent to the brain. This confuses the brain, and the brain may learn to ignore the image from the weaker eye.\n\nStrabismus is the most common cause of amblyopia. Having a family member with strabismus increases your chance of having strabismus.\n\n**Other Causes of Amblyopia**\n\nOther causes include:\n\n* Childhood cataracts\n* Farsightedness, nearsightedness, or astigmatism, especially if it is greater in one eye\n\nIn strabismus, the only problem with the eye itself is that it is pointed in the wrong direction. If poor vision is caused by a problem with the eyeball, such as cataracts, amblyopia will still need to be treated, even if the cataracts are removed.\n\n**Symptoms of Amblyopia**\n\nSymptoms of the condition include:\n\n* Eyes that turn in or out\n* Eyes that do not appear to work together\n* Inability to judge depth correctly\n* Poor vision in one eye\n\n**Exams and Tests for Amblyopia**\n\nIn most cases, amblyopia can be detected with a complete eye exam. Special tests are not often needed.\n\n**Treatment of Amblyopia**\n\nThe first step will be to correct any eye condition that is causing poor vision in the amblyopic eye (such as cataracts).\n\nChildren with a refractive error (nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism) will need glasses.\n\nNext, a patch is placed on the normal eye. This forces the brain to recognize the image from the eye with amblyopia. Sometimes, drops are used to blur the vision of the normal eye instead of putting a patch on it.\n\nNewer treatment techniques use digital computer technology, to show a slightly different image to each eye. Over time, the vision between the eyes becomes equalized.\n\nChildren whose vision will not fully recover, and those with only one good eye due to any disorder should wear glasses. These glasses should be shatter- and scratch-resistant.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis) for Amblyopia**\n\nChildren who get treated before age 5 almost always recover vision that is close to normal. However, they may continue to have problems with depth perception.\n\nPermanent vision problems may result if treatment is delayed. Children treated after age 10 can expect vision to recover only partially.\n\n**Possible Complications of Amblyopia**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Eye muscle problems that may require several surgeries\n* Permanent vision loss in the affected eye\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional about Amblyopia**\n\nContact your health care provider or eye doctor if you suspect a vision problem in a young child.\n\n**Prevention of Amblyopia**\n\nIdentifying and treating the problem early prevents children from having permanent visual loss. All children should have a complete eye exam at least once between ages 3 and 5.\n\nSpecial methods are used to measure vision in a child who is too young to speak. Most eye care professionals can perform these techniques.\n\n---\n\n**Amblyopia**\n\nAmblyopia is the loss of the ability to see clearly through one eye.

Having a family member with strabismus increases your chance of having strabismus.\n\nThe term \"lazy eye\" refers to amblyopia, which often occurs along with strabismus. However, amblyopia can occur due to something other than strabismus. Also, people can have strabismus without amblyopia.\n\nOther causes include:\n\n* Childhood cataracts\n* Farsightedness, nearsightedness, or astigmatism, especially if it is greater in one eye\n\nIn strabismus, the only problem with the eye itself is that it is pointed in the wrong direction. If poor vision is caused by a problem with the eyeball, such as cataracts, amblyopia will still need to be treated, even if the cataracts are removed.

A medicine like paromomycin or diloxanide must also be taken to get rid of all the ameba in the intestine and prevent recurrence.\n\nIn rare cases, the abscess may need to be drained using a catheter or surgery to relieve abdominal pain and increase chances of treatment success.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWithout treatment, the abscess may rupture and spread into other organs, leading to death. People who are treated have a very high chance of complete cure or minor complications.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nThe abscess may rupture into:\n\n* Abdominal cavity\n* Lining of lungs\n* Lungs\n* Sac around heart\n\nInfection can also spread to the brain.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms, especially if you have recently traveled to an area where the disease is known to occur.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhen traveling in tropical countries with poor sanitation, drink purified water and avoid eating uncooked vegetables or unpeeled fruit.\n\n---\n\n**Amebic Liver Abscess**\n\n**Causes**\n\nAmebic liver abscess is caused by a parasite called Entamoeba histolytica. This parasite causes amebiasis, an intestinal infection that is also called amebic dysentery. After an infection has occurred, the parasite may be carried by the bloodstream from the intestines to the liver.\n\nAmebiasis spreads from eating food or water that has been contaminated with feces. This is sometimes due to the use of human waste as fertilizer. Amebiasis is also spread through person-to-person contact.\n\nThe infection occurs worldwide. It is most common in tropical areas where crowded living conditions and poor sanitation exist. Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and India have significant health problems from this disease.\n\nRisk factors for amebic liver abscess include:\n\n* Recent travel to a tropical region\n* Alcoholism\n* Cancer\n* Immunodeficiency, including HIV/AIDS infection\n* Malnutrition\n* Old age\n* Pregnancy\n* Steroid use\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThere are usually no symptoms of intestinal infection. But people with amebic liver abscess do have symptoms, including:\n\n* Abdominal pain, more so in the right, upper part of the abdomen; pain is intense, continuous or stabbing\n* Cough\n* Fever and chills\n* Diarrhea, non-bloody (in only one-third of people with amebic liver abscess)\n* General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise)\n* Hiccups that do not stop (rare)\n* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes, or eyes)\n* Loss of appetite\n* Sweating\n* Weight loss\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical examination. You'll be asked about your symptoms and recent travel. Tests that may be done include:\n\n* Abdominal ultrasound\n* Abdominal CT scan or MRI\n* Complete blood count\n* Liver abscess aspiration to check for bacterial infection in the liver abscess\n* Liver scan\n* Liver function tests\n* Blood test for amebiasis\n* Stool testing for amebiasis\n\n**Treatment**\n\nAntibiotics such as metronidazole (Flagyl) or tinidazole (Tindamax) are the usual treatment for liver abscess. A medicine such as paromomycin or diloxanide must also be taken to get rid of all the ameba in the intestine and to prevent the disease from coming back. This treatment can usually wait until after the abscess has been treated.\n\nIn rare cases, the abscess may need to be drained using a catheter or surgery to relieve some of the abdominal pain and to increase chances of treatment success.\n\n---\n\n**Amebic Liver Abscess**\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWithout treatment, the abscess may break open (rupture) and spread into other organs, leading to death. People who are treated have a very high chance of a complete cure or only minor complications.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nThe abscess may rupture into the abdominal cavity, the lining of the lungs, the lungs, or the sac around the heart. The infection can also spread to the brain.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of this disease, especially if you have recently traveled to an area where the disease is known to occur.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhen traveling in tropical countries with poor sanitation, drink purified water and do not eat uncooked vegetables or unpeeled fruit.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nHepatic amebiasis; Extraintestinal amebiasis; Abscess - amebic liver\n\n**Images**\n\nLiver cell death\nAmebic liver abscess\n\n**References**\n\nHuston CD.

    "content": "**Amelogenesis Imperfecta**\n\n**Description**\n\nAmelogenesis imperfecta is a disorder of tooth development. This condition causes teeth to be unusually small, discolored, pitted or grooved, and prone to rapid wear and breakage. Other dental abnormalities are also possible. These defects, which vary among affected individuals, can affect both primary (baby) teeth and permanent (adult) teeth.\n\nResearchers have described at least 14 forms of amelogenesis imperfecta. These types are distinguished by their specific dental abnormalities and by their pattern of inheritance. Additionally, amelogenesis imperfecta can occur alone without any other signs and symptoms or it can occur as part of a syndrome that affects multiple parts of the body.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThe exact incidence of amelogenesis imperfecta is uncertain. Estimates vary widely, from 1 in 700 people in northern Sweden to 1 in 14,000 people in the United States.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the AMELX, ENAM, MMP20, and FAM83H genes can cause amelogenesis imperfecta. The AMELX, ENAM, and MMP20 genes provide instructions for making proteins that are essential for normal tooth development. Most of these proteins are involved in the formation of enamel, which is the hard, calcium-rich material that forms the protective outer layer of each tooth. Although the function of the protein produced from the FAM83H gene is unknown, it is also believed to be involved in the formation of enamel. Mutations in any of these genes result in altered protein structure or prevent the production of any protein. As a result, tooth enamel is abnormally thin or soft and may have a yellow or brown color. Teeth with defective enamel are weak and easily damaged.\n\nMutations in the genes described above account for only about half of all cases of the condition, with FAM83H gene mutations causing the majority of these cases. In the remaining cases, the genetic cause has not been identified. Researchers are working to find mutations in other genes that are involved in this disorder.\n\n---\n\n**Amelogenesis Imperfecta**\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the AMELX, ENAM, MMP20, and FAM83H genes can cause amelogenesis imperfecta.\n\n*   The AMELX, ENAM, and MMP20 genes provide instructions for making proteins that are essential for normal tooth development.\n*   Most of these proteins are involved in the formation of enamel, which is the hard, calcium-rich material that forms the protective outer layer of each tooth.\n*   Although the function of the protein produced from the FAM83H gene is unknown, it is also believed to be involved in the formation of enamel.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMutations in any of these genes result in altered protein structure or prevent the production of any protein.

Teeth with defective enamel are weak and easily damaged.\n\n**Inheritance Patterns**\n\nAmelogenesis imperfecta can have different inheritance patterns depending on the gene that is altered.\n\n*   Many cases are caused by mutations in the FAM83H gene and are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.\n*   Some cases caused by mutations in the ENAM gene also have an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.\n*   Amelogenesis imperfecta can also be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern; this form of the disorder can result from mutations in the ENAM or MMP20 gene.\n*   About 5 percent of amelogenesis imperfecta cases are caused by mutations in the AMELX gene and are inherited in an X-linked pattern.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nMutations in the genes described above account for only about half of all cases of the condition, with FAM83H gene mutations causing the majority of these cases. In the remaining cases, the genetic cause has not been identified.

It is characterized by the formation of defective or absent enamel on teeth, leading to various dental abnormalities.\n\n**Causes and Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThe AMELX gene plays a crucial role in the development of tooth enamel. Mutations in this gene can cause X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta, which is inherited in an X-linked pattern. This means that males with the condition typically experience more severe dental abnormalities than females.\n\nIn addition to genetic mutations, new gene mutations can also cause AI. These cases occur in individuals with no family history of the disorder.\n\n**Types and Classification**\n\nAI can be classified into different types based on their underlying causes and characteristics. Some common types include:\n\n*   X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta\n*   Autosomal dominant amelogenesis imperfecta\n*   Autosomal recessive amelogenesis imperfecta\n\nEach type has distinct features and inheritance patterns.\n\n**Symptoms and Dental Abnormalities**\n\nIndividuals with AI may experience various dental abnormalities, such as:\n\n*   Hypoplastic or hypocalcified enamel\n*   Enamel defects or pitting\n*   Tooth discoloration or translucency\n*   Increased risk of tooth decay or sensitivity\n\nThe severity and type of dental abnormalities can vary depending on the underlying cause and individual factors.\n\n**Genetic Testing and Diagnosis**\n\nGenetic testing can help identify mutations in the AMELX gene or other genes associated with AI. This information can aid in diagnosis and inform family planning decisions.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nWhile there is no cure for AI, various treatment options are available to manage dental abnormalities and prevent complications. These may include:\n\n*   Dental restorations or fillings\n*   Fluoride therapy\n*   Sealants or coatings\n*   Regular dental check-ups and hygiene\n\nEarly detection and appropriate management can help individuals with AI maintain good oral health and quality of life.\n\n**References**\n\nFor further information on AI, its causes, symptoms, and treatment options, refer to the following scientific articles:\n\n*   Aldred MJ, Savarirayan R, Crawford PJ.

    "content": "**Amelogenesis Imperfecta**\n\nAmelogenesis imperfecta is a tooth development disorder that causes the tooth enamel to be thin and abnormally formed. Enamel is the outer layer of the visible crown portion of the teeth.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAmelogenesis imperfecta is passed down through families as a dominant trait. This means you only need to get the abnormal gene from one parent in order to get the disease.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe enamel of the tooth is soft and thin, causing the teeth to appear yellow and be easily damaged. Both baby teeth and permanent teeth can be affected.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA dentist can identify and diagnose this condition.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment depends on how severe the problem is. Full crowns may be necessary to improve the appearance of the teeth and protect them from further damage. Eating a diet that is low in sugar and practicing very good oral hygiene can reduce the chance of developing cavities.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nTreatment is often successful in protecting the teeth.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nThe enamel is easily damaged, which affects the appearance of the teeth, especially if left untreated.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your dentist if you have symptoms of this condition.\n\n---\n\n**Amelogenesis Imperfecta**\n\n**What is Amelogenesis Imperfecta?**\n\nAmelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of teeth. It is characterized by the formation of defective enamel, leading to discolored, brittle, and often severely decayed teeth.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of AI is still unknown, but it is believed to be related to mutations in certain genes involved in tooth development. The risk factors for developing AI include a family history of the condition, as it is often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of AI can vary in severity and may include:\n\n* Discolored teeth (yellow, brown, or gray)\n* Brittle or fragile teeth\n* Severe tooth decay\n* Tooth loss\n* Difficulty chewing or speaking due to the shape or position of the teeth\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing AI typically involves a combination of clinical examination, medical history, and radiographic imaging. A diagnosis may be made based on the presence of characteristic symptoms, such as discolored or brittle teeth.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for AI, but treatment options are available to manage the symptoms and prevent further complications. These may include:\n\n* Regular dental cleanings and check-ups\n* Fluoride therapy to strengthen tooth enamel\n* Dental restorations (fillings) to repair damaged teeth\n* Extractions of severely decayed or damaged teeth\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with AI depends on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment. With proper care and management, many people with AI can maintain good oral health and prevent further complications.\n\n**References**\n\nDhar VK.

    "content": "**American Ginseng**\n\n**What is it?**\nAmerican ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) is an herb that grows mainly in North America. It's an endangered species in some states due to high demand.\n\nAmerican ginseng is considered an adaptogen. Adaptogens are a class of substances that are believed to stimulate the body's resistance to physical, environmental, and emotional stressors. American ginseng also contains chemicals called ginsenosides, which seem to affect insulin levels and lower blood sugar.\n\nPeople take American ginseng for stress, to boost the immune system, for upper airway infections, diabetes, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.\n\nDon't confuse American ginseng with Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng) or Eleuthero (Eleutherococcus senticosus). These are different plants with different effects.\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\nNatural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\n\nThe effectiveness ratings for AMERICAN GINSENG are as follows:\n\n* Possibly effective for:\n\t+ Upper airway infection. Taking a specific American ginseng extract called CVT-E002 (Cold-FX, Afexa Life Sciences) by mouth during flu season might prevent cold or flu symptoms in some adults.\n* There is interest in using American ginseng for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: American ginseng is likely safe when used short-term. Doses of 100-3000 mg daily have been used safely for up to 12 weeks. Side effects might include headache, but it's usually well-tolerated.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n* Pregnancy: American ginseng is possibly unsafe to use during pregnancy. One of the chemicals in Panax ginseng, a plant related to American ginseng, has been linked to possible birth defects. Don't take American ginseng if you are pregnant.\n* Breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if American ginseng is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n* Children: American ginseng is possibly safe when used short-term. A specific American ginseng extract called CVT-E002 (Cold-FX, Afexa Life Sciences) has been used in doses of 4.5-26 mg/kg by mouth daily for 3 days in children 3-12 years of age.\n* Hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: American ginseng products that contain chemicals called ginsenosides might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, don't use American ginseng that contains ginsenosides. Some American ginseng extracts have had the ginsenosides removed.\n* Insomnia: Taking high doses of American ginseng might cause sleeping problems. If you have trouble sleeping, use American ginseng with caution.\n* Schizophrenia (a mental disorder): Taking high doses of American ginseng might cause sleep problems and agitation in people with schizophrenia.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nAmerican ginseng is typically taken by mouth as a supplement or tea. The recommended dose varies depending on the specific product and intended use, but generally ranges from 100-3000 mg daily for short-term use.\n\n**Other names**\n\n* Panax quinquefolius\n* American ginseng\n\n**Methodology**\n\nThe information in this article is based on a review of scientific evidence and expert opinion. The effectiveness ratings are provided by the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database, which rates the strength of available scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\n\n**References**\n\n* Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database\n* Afexa Life Sciences\n\n---\n\n**American Ginseng: MedlinePlus Supplements**\n\n**Trouble Sleeping**\nUse American ginseng with caution if you have trouble sleeping.\n\n**Schizophrenia (a mental disorder)**\nTaking high doses of American ginseng might cause sleep problems and agitation in people with schizophrenia.\n\n**Surgery**\nAmerican ginseng might affect blood sugar levels and might interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery. Stop taking American ginseng at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.\n\n**Interactions with Medications**\n\n* **Major:** Do not take this combination.\n\t+ Warfarin (Coumadin)\n\t\t- Warfarin is used to slow blood clotting. American ginseng has been reported to decrease the effects of warfarin. This might increase the risk of clotting. It is unclear why this interaction might occur. To avoid this interaction, do not take American ginseng if you take warfarin.\n* **Moderate:** Be cautious with this combination.\n\t+ Medications for depression (MAOIs)\n\t\t- American ginseng might stimulate the body. Some medications used for depression can also stimulate the body. Taking American ginseng along with these medications used for depression might cause side effects such as anxiousness, headache, restlessness, and insomnia.\n\n\t\t- Some common MAOIs include phenelzine (Nardil), selegiline (Zelapar), and tranylcypromine (Parnate).\n\t+ Medications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs)\n\t\t- American ginseng might lower blood sugar levels. Taking American ginseng along with diabetes medications might cause blood sugar to drop too low. Monitor your blood sugar closely.\n\t+ Medications that decrease the immune system (Immunosuppressants)\n\t\t- American ginseng can increase the activity of the immune system. Some medications, such as those used after a transplant, decrease the activity of the immune system. Taking American ginseng along with these medications might decrease the effects of these medications.\n\n**Interactions with Herbs and Supplements**\n\n* **Herbs and supplements that might lower blood sugar**\n\t+ American ginseng might lower blood sugar. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might lower blood sugar too much. Examples of supplements with this effect include aloe, bitter melon, cassia cinnamon, chromium, and prickly pear cactus.\n\n**Interactions with Foods**\n\n* **There are no known interactions with foods.**\n\n**Typical Use**\n\n* American ginseng has most often been used by adults in doses of 200-400 mg by mouth twice daily for 3-6 months. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what dose might be best for a specific condition.\n\n**Other Names**\n\n* Anchi Ginseng, Baie Rouge, Canadian Ginseng, Ginseng, Ginseng à Cinq Folioles, Ginseng Américain, Ginseng Americano, Ginseng d'Amérique, Ginseng D'Amérique du Nord, Ginseng Canadien, Ginseng de l'Ontario, Ginseng du Wisconsin, Ginseng Occidental, Ginseng Root, North American Ginseng, Occidental Ginseng, Ontario Ginseng, Panax Quinquefolia, Panax Quinquefolium, Panax quinquefolius, Racine de Ginseng, Red Berry, Sang, Shang, Shi Yang Seng, Wisconsin Ginseng, Xi Yang Shen.\n\n---\n\n**American Ginseng**\n\n* Also known as: Wisconsin Ginseng, Xi Yang Shen, Shi Yang Seng, Sang, Red Berry, Racine de Ginseng, Panax quinquefolius, Panax Quinquefolium, Panax Quinquefolia, Ontario Ginseng, Medinal Ginseng\n\n**Methodology**\n\nTo learn more about how this article was written, please see the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database methodology.\n\n**References**\n\n* Bell L, Whyte A, Duysburgh C, et al.

However, it's crucial to maintain a balance of these amino acids throughout the day. A diet consisting of a single plant item will not be sufficient. The emphasis has shifted from pairing proteins (like beans with rice) at individual meals to evaluating the overall adequacy of the diet throughout the day.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Binder HJ, Mansbach CM.

    "content": "**Aminoacylase 1 Deficiency**\n\n_Aminoacylase 1 deficiency_ is an inherited disorder that can cause neurological problems; the pattern and severity of signs and symptoms vary widely among affected individuals.\n\n**Description**\n\nIndividuals with this condition typically have delayed development of mental and motor skills (psychomotor delay). They can have movement problems, reduced muscle tone (hypotonia), mild intellectual disability, and seizures. However, some people with aminoacylase 1 deficiency have no health problems related to the condition. A key feature common to all people with aminoacylase 1 deficiency is high levels of modified protein building blocks (amino acids), called N-acetylated amino acids, in the urine.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThe prevalence of aminoacylase 1 deficiency is unknown.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAminoacylase 1 deficiency is caused by mutations in the ACY1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aminoacylase 1, which is involved in the breakdown of proteins when they are no longer needed. Many proteins in the body have an acetyl group attached to one end. This modification, called N-acetylation, helps protect and stabilize the protein. Aminoacylase 1 performs the final step in the breakdown of these proteins by removing the acetyl group from certain amino acids. The amino acids can then be recycled and used to build other proteins.\n\nMutations in the ACY1 gene lead to an aminoacylase 1 enzyme with little or no function. Without this enzyme's function, acetyl groups are not efficiently removed from a subset of amino acids during the breakdown of proteins. The excess N-acetylated amino acids are released from the body in urine. It is not known how a reduction of aminoacylase 1 function leads to neurological problems in people with aminoacylase 1 deficiency.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.\n\n---\n\n**Aminoacylase 1 Deficiency**\n\n**What is Aminoacylase 1 Deficiency?**\n\nAminoacylase 1 deficiency is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ACY1 gene, which codes for the aminoacylase 1 enzyme. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the breakdown of certain amino acids in the body.\n\n**Symptoms and Signs**\n\nIndividuals with aminoacylase 1 deficiency may experience a range of symptoms, including:\n\n* Neurological problems, such as seizures, developmental delays, and intellectual disability\n* Respiratory issues, including chronic lung disease and recurrent respiratory infections\n* Gastrointestinal problems, including diarrhea and malabsorption\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nAminoacylase 1 deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with this condition typically do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder, but they are carriers of one mutated copy of the ACY1 gene.\n\n**Genetic Testing**\n\nGenetic testing can help diagnose aminoacylase 1 deficiency by identifying mutations in the ACY1 gene. This test is usually performed on a blood sample or tissue biopsy.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for aminoacylase 1 deficiency, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. This may include:\n\n* Respiratory therapy to help with breathing\n* Gastrointestinal support to manage diarrhea and malabsorption\n* Medications to control seizures and other neurological symptoms\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with aminoacylase 1 deficiency varies depending on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment. Some individuals may experience significant developmental delays or intellectual disability, while others may have milder symptoms.\n\n**References**\n\nFor further information on aminoacylase 1 deficiency, see the following references:\n\n* Engelke UF, Sass JO, Van Coster RN, Gerlo E, Olbrich H, Krywawych S, Calvin J, Hart C, Omran H, Wevers RA.

It relaxes and opens air passages in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.\n\nThis medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAminophylline comes as a tablet and syrup to take by mouth and a suppository to insert rectally. It usually is taken every 6, 8, or 12 hours. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take aminophylline exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nTake the tablets or oral liquid with a full glass of water on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. Do not chew or crush the long-acting tablets; swallow them whole.\n\nAminophylline controls symptoms of asthma and other lung diseases but does not cure them. Continue to take aminophylline even if you feel well. Do not stop taking aminophylline without talking to your doctor.\n\nTo insert a rectal suppository, follow these steps:\n\n* Remove the wrapper.\n* Dip the tip of the suppository in water.\n* Lie down on your left side and raise your right knee to your chest.

    "content": "**Amish Lethal Microcephaly**\n\n**Description**\n\nAmish lethal microcephaly is a disorder in which infants are born with an unusually small head (microcephaly) and underdeveloped brain.\n\nInfants with Amish lethal microcephaly have a sloping forehead and an extremely small head size. They may also have an unusually small lower jaw and chin (micrognathia) and an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly).\n\nAffected infants may have seizures and difficulty maintaining their body temperature. Often they become very irritable starting in the second or third month of life. A compound called alpha-ketoglutaric acid can be detected in their urine (alpha-ketoglutaric aciduria), and during episodes of viral illness they tend to develop elevated levels of acid in the blood and tissues (metabolic acidosis). Infants with this disorder typically feed adequately but do not develop skills such as purposeful movement or the ability to track faces and sounds. Affected infants live only about six months.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAmish lethal microcephaly occurs in approximately 1 in 500 newborns in the Old Order Amish population of Pennsylvania. It has not been found outside this population.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the SLC25A19 gene cause Amish lethal microcephaly. The SLC25A19 gene provides instructions for producing a protein that is a member of the solute carrier (SLC) family of proteins. Proteins in the SLC family transport various compounds across the membranes surrounding the cell and its component parts.\n\nThe protein produced from the SLC25A19 gene transports a molecule called thiamine pyrophosphate into the mitochondria, the energy-producing centers of cells. This compound is involved in the activity of a group of mitochondrial enzymes called the dehydrogenase complexes, one of which is the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex.\n\nThe transport of thiamine pyrophosphate into the mitochondria is believed to be important in brain development. All known individuals with Amish lethal microcephaly have a mutation in which the protein building block (amino acid) alanine is substituted for the amino acid glycine at position 177 of the SLC25A19 protein, written as Gly177Ala or G177A.\n\nResearchers believe that this mutation interferes with the transport of thiamine pyrophosphate into the mitochondria and the activity of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, resulting in the abnormal brain development and alpha-ketoglutaric aciduria seen in Amish lethal microcephaly.\n\n---\n\n**Amish Lethal Microcephaly**\n\n**What is Amish lethal microcephaly?**\n\nAmish lethal microcephaly is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the brain and nervous system. It is characterized by severe congenital microcephaly, which means that the head is significantly smaller than normal.\n\n**Causes of Amish lethal microcephaly**\n\nThe condition is caused by mutations in the SLC25A19 gene, which provides instructions for producing a protein that transports thiamine pyrophosphate into the mitochondria. This compound is involved in the activity of mitochondrial enzymes called the dehydrogenase complexes. The mutation interferes with the transport of thiamine pyrophosphate and the activity of these enzymes, resulting in abnormal brain development and alpha-ketoglutaric aciduria.\n\n**Symptoms of Amish lethal microcephaly**\n\nThe symptoms of Amish lethal microcephaly include:\n\n* Severe congenital microcephaly\n* Abnormal brain development\n* Alpha-ketoglutaric aciduria\n\n**Inheritance pattern of Amish lethal microcephaly**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with this condition typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other names for Amish lethal microcephaly**\n\n* Amish microcephaly\n* MCPHA\n* Microcephaly, Amish type\n\n**Additional information and resources**\n\nFor more information on Amish lethal microcephaly, you can visit the following resources:\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Amish lethal microcephaly\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Amish lethal microcephaly\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: MICROCEPHALY, AMISH TYPE; MCPHA\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed: Various studies on Amish lethal microcephaly\n\n**References**\n\nFor a list of references related to Amish lethal microcephaly, please see below:\n\n1.

It is characterized by severe microcephaly, which means that the head is significantly smaller than usual.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Symptoms**\n\nThe exact cause of Amish lethal microcephaly is still not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to a mutation in the SLC25A19 gene. This mutation affects the production of thiamine pyrophosphate, an essential coenzyme for many biochemical reactions.\n\nSymptoms of the disorder include:\n\n*   Severe microcephaly\n*   Congenital anomalies of the brain and other organs\n*   Anemia\n*   Embryonic lethality\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment and Prognosis**\n\nThere is no cure for Amish lethal microcephaly, and it is usually fatal in utero. However, researchers have identified several genes that contribute to the disorder, including SLC25A19.\n\nStudies have shown that mutations in these genes can lead to mitochondrial thiamine pyrophosphate depletion, embryonic lethality, CNS malformations, and anemia.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   Brain Malformations\n*   Genetic Disorders",

    "content": "**Amlodipine and Benazepril**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nThe combination of amlodipine and benazepril is used to treat high blood pressure. Amlodipine is in a class of medications called calcium channel blockers. It works by relaxing the blood vessels so the heart does not have to pump as hard. Benazepril is in a class of medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It works by decreasing certain chemicals that tighten the blood vessels, so blood flows more smoothly.\n\nHigh blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nThe combination of amlodipine and benazepril comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day. To help you remember to take amlodipine and benazepril, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take amlodipine and benazepril exactly as directed.

If your doctor prescribes a low-salt or low-sodium diet, follow these directions carefully.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it.

    "title": "Ammonia Levels: MedlinePlus Medical Test",
    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/ammonia-levels/",
    "content": "**Ammonia Levels**\n\nAn ammonia levels test measures the amount of ammonia in a sample of your blood. Ammonia is also called NH3. It is a normal waste product in your body. Healthy bacteria in your intestines make ammonia when you digest protein in the foods you eat.\n\nNormally, your liver changes ammonia into another waste product called urea. Your kidneys get rid of urea in urine (pee). This process is called the urea cycle.\n\nWhen you're healthy, the urea cycle prevents ammonia from building up in your blood. This is very important because ammonia is toxic (poisonous) to your brain. Even small increases in the level of ammonia in your blood can cause permanent brain damage, coma, and even death.\n\n**What Is It Used For?**\n\nAn ammonia levels test may be used to help diagnose high ammonia levels in people who have symptoms. The test alone can't diagnose conditions that increase the amount of ammonia in your blood. But it may be used with other tests to help find the cause.\n\nAmmonia levels testing can help diagnose conditions such as:\n\n* Hepatic encephalopathy\n* Reye syndrome\n* Urea cycle disorders (UCDs)\n\n**Why Do I Need An Ammonia Levels Test?**\n\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms that could be from too much ammonia in your blood. The symptoms depend on how high your ammonia levels are and your age.\n\nSymptoms in children and adults may include:\n\n* Feeling irritable\n* Lack of energy and mental alertness or being very sleepy\n* Vomiting\n* Headache\n* Loss of muscle coordination that may cause difficulties with walking or speech\n* Changes in behavior\n* Confusion, including not being sure about the time and/or where or who you are\n* Mood swings\n* Seizures\n\n**What Happens During An Ammonia Levels Test?**\n\nIn most cases, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial.\n\nYou may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\nIn certain cases, the blood sample may be taken from an artery, which is a blood vessel that carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body. Some providers think blood from an artery may provide more accurate results.\n\nTaking blood from an artery tends to be more uncomfortable than blood tests that use a vein. So, numbing medicine may be applied to your skin first. Afterwards, the site will be bandaged, and pressure will be applied for at least five minutes to stop bleeding.\n\nTo get a blood sample from a newborn, a provider will clean the baby's heel with alcohol. Then the provider will stick the baby's heel with a small needle to collect a few drops of blood. The heel will then be bandaged.\n\n**Will I Need To Do Anything To Prepare For The Test?**\n\nYour provider will give you specific instructions about how to prepare for an ammonia levels test. You should not smoke for several hours before the test. You may be asked to avoid strenuous exercise and alcohol for a period of time.\n\nYou may also need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours. Your provider may tell you to stop taking certain medicines, including diuretics (water pills) and opioid pain medicines. But never stop taking any prescription medicines without talking with your provider first.\n\nBabies do not need any special preparations before the test.\n\n**What Do The Results Mean?**\n\nYour provider will use your test results, symptoms, and medical history to understand what your ammonia levels say about your health. Normal levels vary with age, but in general, low levels are normal and healthy.\n\nIf your test results are normal, your provider will order other tests to find out what's causing your symptoms.\n\nIf your test results show ammonia levels that are higher than normal, it usually means that your body is having trouble getting rid of ammonia. Many types of health conditions can cause high ammonia levels, including:\n\n* Liver diseases, such as cirrhosis or hepatitis\n* Hepatic encephalopathy\n* Kidney disease or kidney failure\n* Certain genetic disorders, including urea cycle disorders\n* Reye syndrome (most common in in children and teens)\n* Taking certain medicines\n\nIf the results of an ammonia levels test are high, more tests will usually be done to diagnose the cause. Treatment will depend on the condition that's causing the problem. If you have questions about your test results or treatment, talk with your provider.\n\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\n\n---\n\n**Ammonia Levels Test**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nAn ammonia levels test measures the amount of ammonia in a sample of your blood. Ammonia is a normal waste product in your body, produced by healthy bacteria in your intestines when you digest protein.\n\n**Why is it important?**\n\nEven small increases in the level of ammonia in your blood can cause permanent brain damage, coma, and even death. The liver changes ammonia into another waste product called urea, which is then removed from your body through urine.\n\n**What are the causes of high ammonia levels?**\n\nLiver disease is the most common cause of high ammonia levels. Other causes include kidney failure and genetic disorders called urea cycle disorders.\n\n**What conditions can an ammonia levels test help diagnose?**\n\nHepatic encephalopathy, Reye syndrome, and urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are some of the conditions that can be diagnosed using this test.\n\n**Why do I need an ammonia levels test?**\n\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms such as:\n\n* Feeling irritable\n* Lack of energy and mental alertness or being very sleepy\n* Vomiting\n* Headache\n* Loss of muscle coordination that may cause difficulties with walking or speech\n* Changes in behavior\n* Confusion, including not being sure about the time and/or where or who you are\n* Mood swings\n* Seizures\n\n**How is the test performed?**\n\nIn most cases, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle. The blood sample may also be taken from an artery, which tends to be more uncomfortable.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou may be told to avoid lifting heavy objects for 24 hours after the test if you have an arterial blood sample.\n\n---\n\n**Ammonia Levels Test**\n\n**What is the test for?**\n\nThe ammonia levels test, also known as a blood ammonia test, measures the amount of ammonia in your blood. Ammonia is a toxic substance that can build up in your body due to various health conditions.\n\n**How is the test performed?**\n\nFor adults and children over 2 years old:\n\n* You will be seated comfortably in a chair.\n* A healthcare provider will insert a needle into a vein in your arm or hand to collect a blood sample.\n* The blood sample will then be sent to a laboratory for analysis.\n\nFor babies under 2 years old:\n\n* The test is usually performed on a heel prick, where a small amount of blood is collected from the baby's heel using a special device.\n* The heel will then be bandaged.\n\n**Will I need to prepare for the test?**\n\nYes, you may need to prepare for the test. Your provider will give you specific instructions about how to prepare. You should not smoke for several hours before the test. You may also be asked to avoid strenuous exercise and alcohol for a period of time. Additionally, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider may tell you to stop taking certain medicines, including diuretics (water pills) and opioid pain medicines.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. If your blood sample was taken from an artery, you may also have some bleeding where the needle was put in. Very rarely, the needle may damage a nerve or the artery.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nYour provider will use your test results, symptoms, and medical history to understand what your ammonia levels say about your health. Normal levels vary with age, but in general, low levels are normal and healthy. If your test results show ammonia levels that are higher than normal, it usually means that your body is having trouble getting rid of ammonia. Many types of health conditions can cause high ammonia levels, including liver diseases, kidney disease or kidney failure, certain genetic disorders, Reye syndrome (most common in children and teens), and taking certain medicines.\n\n**References**\n\n* Ah Mew N, Simpson KL, Gropman AL, et al.

These include:\n\n* Alcohol\n* Acetazolamide\n* Barbiturates\n* Diuretics\n* Narcotics\n* Valproic acid\n\nYou should not smoke before your blood is drawn.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nAmmonia (NH3) is produced by cells throughout the body, especially the intestines, liver, and kidneys. Most of the ammonia produced in the body is used by the liver to produce urea. Urea is also a waste product, but it is much less toxic than ammonia. Ammonia is especially toxic to the brain. It can cause confusion, low energy, and sometimes coma.\n\nThis test may be done if you have, or your provider thinks you have, a condition that may cause a toxic buildup of ammonia. It is most commonly used to diagnose and monitor hepatic encephalopathy, a severe liver disease.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe normal range is 15 to 45 µ/dL (11 to 32 µmol/L).\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAbnormal results may mean you have increased ammonia levels in your blood. This may be due to any of the following:\n\n* Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, usually in the upper GI tract\n* Genetic diseases of the urea cycle\n* High body temperature (hyperthermia)\n* Kidney disease\n* Liver failure\n* Low blood potassium level (in people with liver disease)\n* Parenteral nutrition (nutrition by vein)\n* Reye syndrome\n* Salicylate poisoning\n* Severe muscle exertion\n* Ureterosigmoidostomy (a procedure to reconstruct the urinary tract in certain illnesses)\n* Urinary tract infection with a bacteria called Proteus mirabilis\n\nA high-protein diet can also raise the blood ammonia level.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk in having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nSerum ammonia; Encephalopathy - ammonia; Cirrhosis - ammonia; Liver failure - ammonia\n\n**References**\n\nDaniels L, Khalili M, Goldstein E, Bluth MH, Bowne WB, Pincus MR.

Blood and urine tests will be done. The person may receive:\n\n* Airway and breathing support, including oxygen.\n* In extreme cases, a tube may be passed through the mouth into the lungs to prevent aspiration. A breathing machine (ventilator) would then be needed.\n* Bronchoscopy, which involves inserting a camera into the throat, bronchial tubes, and lungs to check for burns in those tissues.\n* Chest x-ray.\n* ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing).\n* Endoscopy - a camera down the throat to see burns in the esophagus and stomach.\n* Fluids through a vein (by IV).\n* Medicines to treat symptoms.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nDamage is related to the amount and strength (concentration) of the ammonia. Most household cleaners are relatively weak and cause little or mild damage. Industrial strength cleaners can cause severe burns and injury.\n\nSurvival past 48 hours most often indicates recovery will occur. Chemical burns that occurred in the eye frequently heal; however, permanent blindness may result.\n\n---\n\n**Ammonia Poisoning**\n\n**What is Ammonia Poisoning?**\n\nAmmonia poisoning occurs when you breathe in ammonia gas or swallow products containing large amounts of ammonia. This can happen if you mix ammonia with bleach, which releases toxic chlorine gas.\n\n**Symptoms of Ammonia Poisoning**\n\n* Cough\n* Chest pain (severe)\n* Chest tightness\n* Difficulty breathing\n* Rapid breathing\n* Wheezing\n* Fever\n* Tearing and burning of eyes\n* Temporary blindness\n* Throat pain (severe)\n* Mouth pain\n* Lip swelling\n* Rapid, weak pulse\n* Collapse and shock\n* Confusion\n* Difficulty walking\n* Dizziness\n* Lack of coordination\n* Restlessness\n* Stupor (altered level of consciousness)\n* Bluish-colored lips and fingernails\n* Severe burns if contact is longer than a few minutes\n\n**Where Can Ammonia Be Found?**\n\nAmmonia can be found in:\n\n* Ammonia gas\n* Some household cleaners\n* Some liniments\n* Some fertilizers\n\n**Home Care for Ammonia Poisoning**\n\nDO NOT make a person throw up unless told to do so by poison control or a health care professional. Seek immediate medical help.\n\nIf the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.\n\nIf the chemical was swallowed, immediately give the person water or milk, unless told otherwise by a health care provider. DO NOT give water or milk if the person is having symptoms (such as vomiting, convulsions, or a decreased level of alertness) that make it hard to swallow.\n\nIf the poison was inhaled, immediately move them to fresh air.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nIf you go to the emergency room, take the container for the poison with you, if possible. The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Blood and urine tests will be done. The person may receive:\n\n* Airway and breathing support, including oxygen\n* Bronchoscopy, which involves inserting a camera into the throat, bronchial tubes, and lungs to check for burns in those tissues\n* Chest x-ray\n* ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)\n* Endoscopy - a camera down the throat to see burns in the esophagus and stomach\n* Fluids through a vein (by IV)\n* Medicines to treat symptoms\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nDamage is related to the amount and strength (concentration) of the ammonia.

    "content": "**Ammonium Lactate Topical**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nAmmonium lactate is used to treat xerosis (dry or scaly skin) and ichthyosis vulgaris (an inherited dry skin condition) in adults and children. Ammonium lactate is in a class of medications called alpha-hydroxy acids. It works by increasing skin hydration.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAmmonium lactate comes as a cream and a lotion to apply to the skin. It is usually applied to the affected skin area twice daily. Apply ammonium lactate at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Apply ammonium lactate exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nShake the lotion container well before each use to mix the medication evenly.\n\nTo use ammonium lactate topical, apply a small amount of cream or lotion to cover the affected area of skin and rub it in gently.\n\nThis medication is only for use on the skin. Keep ammonium lactate topical away from your eyes, mouth, and vaginal area, and do not swallow it.\n\nIf your skin condition becomes worse with treatment, contact your doctor.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore using ammonium lactate,\n\n* tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to ammonium lactate, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in ammonium lactate cream or lotion. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\n* tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while using ammonium lactate. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n* tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while using ammonium lactate, call your doctor.\n* plan to avoid unnecessary or prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sunlight to the affected skin area and to wear protective clothing, sunglasses, and sunscreen. Ammonium lactate can cause your affected skin area to be sensitive to sunlight.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\nNote: The original text has been reformatted and cleaned up for better readability.\n\n---\n\n**Ammonium Lactate Topical: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nApply the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not apply extra cream or lotion to make up for a missed dose.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nAmmonium lactate topical may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* stinging (especially on cracked or broken skin)\n* skin redness, burning, or itching\n* skin irritation (especially on the face)\n* skin peeling\n* rash\n* dry skin\n\nAmmonium lactate may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while using this medication.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom).\n\nDispose of unneeded medications in a way so that pets, children, and other people cannot take them. Do not flush this medication down the toilet. Use a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist about take-back programs in your community. Visit the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website for more information.\n\nKeep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers are not child-resistant. Always lock safety caps. Place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf someone swallows ammonium lactate, call your local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222. If the victim has collapsed or is not breathing, call local emergency services at 911.\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nKeep all appointments with your doctor.\n\nDo not let anyone else use your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription. If you still have symptoms after you finish your cream or lotion, call your doctor.\n\nKeep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines, vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements you are taking. Bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to the hospital. You should carry the list with you in case of emergencies.\n\n**Brand names**\n\nLac-Hydrin¶\n\n¶This branded product is no longer on the market. Generic alternatives may be available.",

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/amniocentesis-amniotic-fluid-test/",
    "content": "**Amniocentesis (amniotic fluid test)**\n\n**What is amniocentesis?**\n\nAmniocentesis is a test done during pregnancy. A sample of amniotic fluid is taken from your abdomen (belly). It is used to diagnose certain genetic disorders, birth defects, and other conditions in your unborn baby. The test is usually done between weeks 15 and 20 of pregnancy.\n\n**Your Baby's Amniotic Sac**\n\nYour baby grows in an amniotic sac inside your uterus. The sac is filled with amniotic fluid, a clear or pale yellow liquid. The fluid that surrounds and protects your baby throughout pregnancy. It also helps with your baby's development and helps keep your baby at the right temperature. The fluid contains cells that can provide important information about your baby's health.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nAmniocentesis is used to diagnose certain health problems in an unborn baby. It is commonly used to find:\n\n* Genetic and chromosomal disorders, including:\n\t+ Down syndrome\n\t+ Cystic fibrosis\n\t+ Sickle cell disease\n\t+ Tay-Sachs disease\n\t+ Neural tube defects (such as spina bifida and anencephaly)\n\nThe test may also be used to:\n\n* Check your baby's lung development if you have a risk of giving birth too soon (premature birth)\n* Diagnose an infection or certain other illnesses in the baby\n\n**Why do I need amniocentesis?**\n\nHaving amniocentesis is your choice. You may want this test if you have a higher risk of having a baby with a health problem. You may have a higher risk if:\n\n* You are age 35 or older; the risk of having a baby with a genetic disorder increases with age\n* You had a prenatal screening test that showed your baby might have a problem\n* You or your partner have a family history of a genetic disorder or neural tube defect\n* You or your partner had genetic testing that showed you carry a genetic disorder\n\n**What happens during amniocentesis?**\n\nThe test is usually done between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. It is sometimes done later in pregnancy to check the baby's lung development or diagnose certain infections or illnesses, such as anemia in the unborn baby caused by Rh incompatibility.\n\nDuring the procedure:\n\n* You'll lie on your back on an exam table\n* Your provider will apply a gel to your belly\n* Your provider will move an ultrasound wand-like device, called a transducer, on your belly. Ultrasound uses sound waves to show the position of your baby and placenta so your provider can see where to take a sample of amniotic fluid.\n* Your provider will clean your belly\n* Your provider will insert a thin needle into your belly, withdraw a small amount of amniotic fluid, and then remove the needle\n* When the sample is removed, your provider will check your baby's heartbeat with the ultrasound\n* The sample is sent to a lab for testing. Results may take from a few days to a few weeks.\n\nThe procedure usually takes about 15 minutes. Afterward, you may be told not to exercise or have sex for a day or two.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nIf you are early in your pregnancy, you may be asked not to urinate (pee) before the test to make sure that you have a full bladder. This helps move the uterus into a better position for the test. In later pregnancy, you need to have an empty bladder for the test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nYou may feel mild stinging, pressure, and/or cramping during the test. Afterward, you may have mild discomfort or vaginal bleeding, or a small amount of amniotic fluid may leak from your vagina.\n\nThe risk of serious complications is extremely low. Your provider will let you know if there are any symptoms that you should tell them about. These may include ongoing vaginal bleeding, amniotic fluid leakage, severe cramping, or a fever.\n\nAmniocentesis does have a very slight risk (less than 1 percent) of causing a miscarriage.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nAmniotic fluid may be tested for many different disorders. Your test results will depend on which tests your provider ordered.\n\nNormal results are reported as \"normal\" or \"negative.\" This means that it's very unlikely that your baby has the disorder that was tested, but it does not guarantee your baby will not have any health problems.\nResults that are not normal are reported as \"abnormal\" or \"positive.\" This means that your baby very likely has the disorder that was tested.\n\nYour provider will explain your test results. Amniocentesis is very accurate, but in certain cases, your provider may order more tests to learn about your baby's health.\n\nIt may help to speak to a genetic counselor before testing and/or after you get your results. A genetic counselor is a specially trained professional in genetics and genetic testing who can help you understand what your results mean.\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about amniocentesis?**\n\nIn some cases, you may want information about your unborn baby sooner than 15 to 20 weeks, when amniocentesis is usually done. In that case, you might consider another diagnostic test called a chorionic villus sampling (CVS). This test takes a small sample of tissue from the placenta.\n\nYou can have a CVS test between 10 and 13 weeks of pregnancy, which gives you more time to decide what to do if the results are abnormal. Like amniocentesis, CVS is an accurate diagnostic test that can find certain genetic disorders. But it has a slightly higher risk of miscarriage.\n\nAs you make decisions about testing, remember that prenatal genetic diagnostic tests are different from screening tests. Screening tests estimate the chances that your unborn baby may have certain problems. It's possible to have an abnormal screening test when your baby is actually healthy. But if a screening test shows that your baby has a risk for certain problems, you may have amniocentesis or CVS to find out for sure.\n\n---\n\n**Amniocentesis (Amniotic Fluid Test)**\n\n**What is Amniocentesis?**\n\nAmniocentesis is a diagnostic test used during pregnancy to diagnose certain genetic disorders, birth defects, and other conditions in an unborn baby. The test involves taking a sample of amniotic fluid from the mother's abdomen.\n\n**How Does Amniocentesis Work?**\n\nThe test is usually done between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy using ultrasound technology to guide the needle into the uterus. A small amount of amniotic fluid is withdrawn, and then sent to a lab for testing.\n\n**What Is Amniotic Fluid Used For?**\n\nAmniotic fluid contains cells that can provide important information about the baby's health. The test may be used to diagnose genetic disorders such as Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, Tay-Sachs disease, and neural tube defects.\n\n**Why Do I Need Amniocentesis?**\n\nYou may want this test if you have a higher risk of having a baby with a health problem. You may have a higher risk if:\n\n* You are age 35 or older\n* You had a prenatal screening test that showed your baby might have a problem\n* You or your partner have a family history of a genetic disorder or neural tube defect\n* You or your partner had genetic testing that showed you carry a genetic disorder\n\n**What Happens During Amniocentesis?**\n\nThe procedure usually takes about 15 minutes. You'll lie on your back on an exam table, and your provider will apply a gel to your belly. They will then move an ultrasound wand-like device on your belly to show the position of your baby and placenta. A thin needle will be inserted into your belly to withdraw a small amount of amniotic fluid.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nIf you are early in your pregnancy, you may be asked not to urinate (pee) before the test to make sure that you have a full bladder. In later pregnancy, you need to have an empty bladder for the test.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nYou may feel mild stinging, pressure, and/or cramping during the test. Afterward, you may have mild discomfort or vaginal bleeding, or a small amount of amniotic fluid may leak from your vagina. The risk of serious complications is extremely low, but there is a very slight risk (less than 1 percent) of causing a miscarriage.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nNormal results are reported as \"normal\" or \"negative.\" This means that it's very unlikely that your baby has the disorder that was tested, but it does not guarantee your baby will not have any health problems. Results that are not normal are reported as \"abnormal\" or \"positive,\" indicating that your baby very likely has the disorder that was tested.\n\n---\n\n**Amniocentesis (Amniotic Fluid Test)**\n\n**What is Amniocentesis?**\n\nAmniocentesis is a medical test that involves removing a small sample of amniotic fluid from the uterus during pregnancy. The fluid is then tested for various disorders, such as Down syndrome or sickle cell disease.\n\n**How Accurate is Amniocentesis?**\n\nAmniocentesis is very accurate, but in certain cases, your provider may order more tests to learn about your baby's health.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nResults that are not normal are reported as \"abnormal\" or \"positive.\" This means that your baby very likely has the disorder that was tested. Your provider will explain your test results.\n\n**When is Amniocentesis Usually Done?**\n\nAmniocentesis is usually done between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n**What if I Want Information Sooner Than 15 to 20 Weeks?**\n\nIf you want information about your unborn baby sooner than 15 to 20 weeks, you might consider another diagnostic test called a chorionic villus sampling (CVS). This test takes a small sample of tissue from the placenta and can be done between 10 and 13 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n**What is CVS?**\n\nCVS is an accurate diagnostic test that can find certain genetic disorders. However, it has a slightly higher risk of miscarriage compared to amniocentesis.\n\n**How Do I Decide Which Test to Take?**\n\nAs you make decisions about testing, remember that prenatal genetic diagnostic tests are different from screening tests. Screening tests estimate the chances that your unborn baby may have certain problems. It's possible to have an abnormal screening test when your baby is actually healthy. But if a screening test shows that your baby has a risk for certain problems, you may have amniocentesis or CVS to find out for sure.\n\n**What Can I Do After Receiving My Test Results?**\n\nIt may help to speak to a genetic counselor before testing and/or after you get your results. A genetic counselor is a specially trained professional in genetics and genetic testing who can help you understand what your results mean.\n\n**References**\n\n* American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).

Amniocentesis is a test that detects or rules out certain inherited disorders in a fetus. It also assesses lung maturity to see if the fetus can endure an early delivery. You can also find out the baby's sex.\n\n**Who is at risk?**\n\nDoctors generally offer amniocentesis to women with an increased risk of having a baby with particular disorders, including those who:\n\n* Will be 35 or older when they deliver.\n* Have a close relative with a disorder.\n* Had a previous pregnancy or baby affected by a disorder.\n* Have test results (such as a high or low alpha-fetoprotein count) that may indicate an abnormality.\n\n**Pregnancy complications**\n\nDoctors also offer amniocentesis to women with pregnancy complications, such as Rh-incompatibility, that necessitate early delivery. There are blood tests and ultrasound tests that can be done earlier in the pregnancy which may avoid the need for amniocentesis at times.\n\nReview Date 8/23/2023\n\nUpdated by: LaQuita Martinez, MD, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Emory Johns Creek Hospital, Alpharetta, GA.

Often, the deformity is not severe and no treatment is needed. Surgery while the baby is in the womb is being studied and may help improve outcomes in rare cases. Some cases improve or resolve prior to birth. In more serious cases, major surgery may be needed to reconstruct all or some of a body part.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well the infant does depends on the severity of the condition.

These bands are made of fibrotic tissue and can constrict various body parts, leading to loss of function.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of amniotic band sequence is unknown, but it is believed to occur due to:\n\n*   **Fetal movement**: The fetus may move in a way that causes the amniotic sac to tear, resulting in the formation of bands.\n*   **Amniotic fluid imbalance**: An imbalance in the amount of amniotic fluid can lead to an increased risk of band formation.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of amniotic band sequence vary depending on the severity and location of the bands. Some common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Constriction rings**: Bands that constrict various body parts, leading to loss of function.\n*   **Fetal deformities**: The fetus may be born with deformities such as clubfoot or limb abnormalities.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for amniotic band sequence, and treatment is usually focused on managing the symptoms. In severe cases, surgical intervention may be necessary to remove the constricting bands.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for babies born with amniotic band sequence varies depending on the severity of the condition. In some cases, the baby may require ongoing medical care to manage the symptoms, while in other cases, the condition may resolve on its own.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Crum CP, Laury AR, Hirsch MS, Quick CM, Peters WA.

The amount of amniotic fluid is greatest at about 34 weeks into the pregnancy (34 weeks gestation), when it averages 800 mL. About 600 mL of amniotic fluid surrounds the baby at full term (40 weeks gestation).\n\nThe amniotic fluid constantly moves (circulates) as the baby swallows and \"inhales\" the fluid, and then releases it.\n\n**Functions**\n\n* The developing baby to move in the womb, which allows for proper bone growth\n* The lungs to develop properly\n* Prevent pressure on the umbilical cord\n* Keep a constant temperature around the baby, protecting from heat loss\n* Protect the baby from outside injury by cushioning sudden blows or movements\n\n**Abnormal Amounts**\n\nToo much amniotic fluid is called polyhydramnios. This condition can occur with multiple pregnancies (twins or triplets), congenital anomalies (problems that exist when the baby is born), or gestational diabetes.\n\nToo little amniotic fluid is known as oligohydramnios.
