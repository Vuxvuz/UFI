    "content": "**Delivery Presentations**\n\nIn order to deliver a baby, the baby must pass through the mother's pelvic bones to reach the vaginal opening. The ease with which this passage takes place depends on how the baby is positioned during delivery.\n\n**Best Position for Delivery**\n\nThe best position for the baby to be in to pass through the pelvis is with the head down and the front of the body facing towards the mother's back. This position is called occiput anterior (OA).\n\n*   **Occiput Anterior (OA)**: The baby's head is down, and the front of the body faces towards the mother's back.\n*   **Breech Position**: The baby's bottom is facing down instead of the head. This position is not safe for vaginal delivery.\n\n**Other Delivery Positions**\n\nThere are other delivery positions that can occur during pregnancy:\n\n*   **Occiput Posterior (OP)**: The baby's head is down, but it is facing the mother's front instead of her back.\n*   **Transverse Position**: The baby is sideways, with the shoulders or back over the mother's cervix.\n\n**Less Common Presentations**\n\nThere are also less common presentations that can occur during delivery:\n\n*   **Brow-First Position**: The baby's head extends backward, and the forehead leads the way.\n*   **Face-First Position**: The baby's head is extended backwards even more than with brow-first position.\n\n**Risk Factors for Vaginal Birth**\n\nIf a vaginal birth is not possible due to the baby's position, it may be necessary to deliver the baby by cesarean section. Risk factors for vaginal birth include:\n\n*   **Early Labor**: Going into labor early\n*   **Multiple Pregnancies**: Having given birth 3 or more times\n*   **Placenta Previa**: Having placenta previa\n\n**References**\n\nBarth WH.

This position allows for the easiest passage through the pelvis.\n\n**Breech Position**\n\nIf the baby is in a breech position, with its bottom facing down instead of its head, it's not safe to deliver vaginally. Most babies will be in the head-down position by around 34 weeks, and part of prenatal care after this stage involves ensuring the baby is in the correct position.\n\n**Occiput Posterior (OP)**\n\nIn occiput posterior position, the baby's head is down, but it's facing the mother's front instead of her back. While it's safe to deliver a baby in this position, it can be harder for the baby to pass through the pelvis. The mother may need to try different delivery positions during labor to encourage the baby to turn.\n\n**Transverse Position**\n\nA baby in the transverse position is sideways, with its shoulders or back over the mother's cervix. This increases the risk of complications and typically requires a cesarean birth (C-section) unless the baby can be turned into a head-down position.\n\n**Less Common Presentations**\n\nThere are several less common delivery presentations that can occur during labor, including brow-first and face-first positions. In some cases, vaginal birth may still be possible, but labor will generally take longer.\n\n---\n\n**Delivery Presentations**\n\n**Part 3/3**\n\nWith the brow-first position, the baby's head extends backward (like looking up), and the forehead leads the way. This position may be more common if this is not your first pregnancy.\n\nYour provider rarely detects this position before labor. An ultrasound may be able to confirm a brow presentation.\nMore likely, your provider will detect this position while you are in labor during an internal exam.\n\nWith face-first position, the baby's head is extended backwards even more than with brow first position.\n\nMost of the time, the force of contractions causes the baby to be in face-first position.\nIt is also detected when labor does not progress.\n\nIn some of these presentations, a vaginal birth is possible, but labor will generally take longer. After delivery, the baby's face or brow will be swollen and may appear bruised. These changes will go away over the next few days.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Pregnancy - delivery presentation\n* Labor - delivery presentation\n* Occiput posterior\n* Occiput anterior\n* Brow presentation\n\n**Images**\n\n* Delivery presentations\n* Breech - series\n\n**References**\n\nBarth WH.

    "content": "**Demeclocycline**\n\n**What is Demeclocylline?**\n\nDemeclocycline is a type of antibiotic medication used to treat various bacterial infections.\n\n**Why is Demeclocycline prescribed?**\n\nDemeclocycline is used to treat:\n\n* Pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections\n* Certain infections of the skin, eye, lymphatic, intestinal, genital, and urinary systems\n* Infections spread by ticks, lice, mites, and infected animals\n* Acne (when used along with other medications)\n* Plague and tularemia (serious infections that may be spread on purpose as part of a bioterror attack)\n* Certain types of food poisoning and anthrax (a very serious infection that may be spread on purpose as part of a bioterror attack)\n\n**How should Demeclocycline be used?**\n\nDemeclocycline comes in tablet form and is taken by mouth. It is usually taken two or four times a day, on an empty stomach at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals. Do not take demeclocycline with food, especially dairy products such as milk, yogurt, cheese, and ice cream.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nDemeclocycline is in a class of medications called tetracycline antibiotics. It works by preventing the growth and spread of bacteria. Antibiotics such as demeclocycline will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of Demeclocycline?**\n\nStore demeclocycline at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you take too much demeclocycline or experience any side effects, seek medical attention immediately.\n\n**Other information**\n\nDemeclocycline is also sometimes used to treat syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH; condition in which the body produces too much of a certain natural substance that causes the body to retain water). Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.\n\n---\n\n**Demeclocycline: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**What is Demeclocycline?**\n\nDemeclocycline is a medication used to treat certain conditions, including syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), a condition in which the body produces too much of a certain natural substance that causes the body to retain water.\n\n**Special Precautions**\n\nBefore taking demeclocycline, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to demeclocycline, tetracycline, minocycline, doxycycline, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in demeclocycline tablets. Also, inform your doctor about all prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking demeclocycline.\n\nBe aware that antacids containing magnesium, aluminum, or calcium, calcium supplements, iron products, and laxatives containing magnesium interfere with demeclocycline. Take demeclocycline 2 hours before or 6 hours after antacids, calcium supplements, and laxatives containing magnesium. Also, take demeclocycline 2 hours before or 4 hours after iron preparations and vitamin products that contain iron.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had lupus (a condition in which the immune system attacks many tissues and organs including the skin, joints, blood, and kidneys), or kidney or liver disease. Demeclocycline may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, or injections). Talk to your doctor about using another form of birth control.\n\nIf you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding, inform your doctor immediately. Demeclocycline can harm the fetus. Also, avoid unnecessary or prolonged exposure to sunlight and wear protective clothing, sunglasses, and sunscreen. Demeclocycline may make your skin sensitive to sunlight.\n\n**Special Dietary Instructions**\n\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n**What if I Forget a Dose?**\n\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**Side Effects**\n\nDemeclocycline may cause side effects, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, changes in skin or mouth color, throat irritation, excessive thirst, frequent urination, weakness, inflammation of the end of the penis, and others. Some side effects can be serious, so call your doctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms:\n\n* headache\n* blurred vision, seeing double, or loss of vision\n* dizziness\n* ringing in the ears\n* rash\n* hives\n* peeling or blistering skin\n* swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, and eyes\n* difficulty breathing or swallowing\n* unusual bleeding or bruising\n* confusion\n* swelling of your legs, ankles, or feet\n* decreased urination\n* joint pain\n* chest pain\n* watery or bloody stools, stomach cramps, or fever during treatment or for up to two or more months after stopping treatment\n* a return of fever, sore throat, chills, or other signs of infection\n\nCall your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.\n\n---\n\n**Demeclocycline: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**What is Demeclocycline?**\n\nDemeclocycline is a medication used to treat certain types of infections.\n\n**How Should I Take This Medication?**\n\nTake this medication exactly as directed by your doctor.

    "content": "**Dementia - Daily Care**\n\nPeople who have dementia may have trouble with:\n\n* Language and communication\n* Eating\n* Handling their own personal care\n* Memory loss\n\nTo help manage early memory loss, people can give themselves reminders to function each day. Some of these reminders include:\n\n* Asking the person you are talking with to repeat what they said.\n* Repeating what someone said to you one or two times. This will help you remember it better.\n* Writing down your appointments and other activities in a planner or on a calendar. Keep your planner or calendar in an obvious place, like beside your bed.\n* Posting messages around your home where you will see them, such as the bathroom mirror, next to the coffee pot, or on the phone.\n* Keeping a list of important phone numbers next to every phone.\n* Having clocks and calendars around the house so you stay aware of the date and what time it is.\n* Labeling important items.\n* Developing habits and routines that are easy to follow.\n* Planning activities that improve your thinking, such as puzzles, games, baking, or indoor gardening. Have someone nearby for any tasks that may have a risk of injury.\n\n**Eating and Nutrition**\n\nSome people who have dementia may refuse food or not eat enough to stay healthy on their own.\n\nHelp the person get enough exercise by asking them to go outside with you for a walk.\n\nHave someone the person likes, such as a friend or relative, prepare and serve them food.\n\nReduce distractions around the eating area, such as the radio or TV.\n\nDo not give them foods that are too hot or too cold.\n\nGive the person finger foods if they have problems using utensils.\n\nTry different foods. It is common for people who have dementia to have decreased smell and taste. This may affect their enjoyment of food.\n\n**Tips for Talking To Someone With Dementia**\n\nKeep distractions and noise down:\n\n* Turn off the radio or TV\n* Close the curtains\n* Move to a quieter room\n\nTo avoid surprising the person, try to make eye contact before touching or speaking to them.\n\nUse simple words and sentences and speak slowly. Speak in a quiet voice. Talking loudly, as if the person is hard of hearing, will not help. Repeat your words, if needed. Use names and places the person knows. Try not to use pronouns, such as he, she, and them. This can confuse someone with dementia. Tell them when you are going to change the subject.\n\nTalk to people who have dementia as adults. Don't make them feel as if they are children. And don't pretend to understand them if you do not.\n\nAsk questions so they can answer with yes or no. Give the person clear choices, and a visual cue, such as pointing to something, if possible. Don't give them too many options.\n\nWhen giving instructions:\n\n* Break directions down into small and simple steps.\n* Allow time for the person to understand.\n* If they get frustrated, consider switching to another activity.\n\nTry to get them talking about something they enjoy. Many people with dementia like to talk about the past, and many can remember the distant past better than recent events. Even if they remember something wrong, do not insist on correcting them.\n\n**Personal Grooming**\n\nPeople with dementia may need help with personal care and grooming.\n\nTheir bathroom should be nearby and easy to find. Consider leaving the bathroom door open, so they can see it. Suggest that they visit the bathroom several times a day.\n\nMake sure their bathroom is warm. Get them undergarments made for urine or stool leakage. Make sure they are cleaned well after going to the bathroom. Be gentle when helping. Try to respect their dignity.\n\nMake sure the bathroom is safe. Common safety devices are:\n\n* A tub or shower seat\n* Handrails\n* Anti-skid mats\n\nDo not let them use razors with blades. Electric razors are best for shaving. Remind the person to brush their teeth at least 2 times a day.\n\nA person with dementia should have clothing that is easy to put on and take off.\n\nDo not give them too many choices about what to wear.\nVelcro is much easier than buttons and zippers to use. If they still wear clothes with buttons and zippers, they should be in the front.\nGet them pullover clothes and slip on shoes, as their dementia gets worse.\n\n---\n\n**Daily Care for Dementia Patients**\n\nWhen caring for individuals with dementia, it's essential to understand their unique needs and challenges. One crucial aspect of daily care is ensuring they receive proper nutrition.\n\n**Eating and Nutrition**\n\nSome people who have dementia may refuse food or not eat enough to stay healthy on their own. To address this issue:\n\n*   Help the person get enough exercise by taking them for a walk outside.\n*   Have someone they like, such as a friend or relative, prepare and serve them food.\n*   Reduce distractions around the eating area, like turning off the radio or TV.\n*   Avoid giving them foods that are too hot or too cold.\n*   Offer finger foods if they have trouble using utensils.\n*   Try different foods, as decreased smell and taste can affect their enjoyment of food.\n\nIn later stages of dementia, the person may have trouble chewing or swallowing. Consult with their healthcare provider about a proper diet, which may eventually require only liquid or soft foods to prevent choking.\n\n**Tips for Talking to Someone With Dementia**\n\nWhen interacting with individuals who have dementia, it's vital to adapt your communication approach:\n\n*   Keep distractions and noise down by turning off the radio or TV, closing curtains, and moving to a quieter room.\n*   Make eye contact before touching or speaking to them to avoid surprising them.\n*   Use simple words and sentences, speak slowly, and maintain a quiet voice. Avoid talking loudly as if they're hard of hearing.\n*   Repeat your words if needed, and use names and places the person knows. Refrain from using pronouns like \"he,\" \"she,\" or \"them.\"\n*   Tell them when you'll change the subject to provide clarity.\n\nTreat people with dementia as adults, avoiding a condescending tone. Don't pretend to understand them if you don't, and instead ask questions that allow for yes or no responses. Provide clear choices and visual cues, like pointing to something, if possible.\n\nWhen giving instructions:\n\n*   Break directions down into small, simple steps.\n*   Allow time for the person to understand.\n*   If they become frustrated, consider switching to another activity.\n\nTry to engage them in conversations about their interests. Many people with dementia enjoy discussing the past, and some can recall distant memories better than recent events. Even if they remember things incorrectly, avoid correcting them.\n\n**Personal Grooming**\n\nIndividuals with dementia may require assistance with personal care and grooming:\n\n*   Ensure their bathroom is nearby and easy to find. Consider leaving the door open so they can see it.\n*   Suggest frequent visits to the bathroom throughout the day.\n*   Make sure the bathroom is warm, and provide undergarments designed for urine or stool leakage.\n*   Be gentle when helping, and respect their dignity.\n\nTo maintain safety in the bathroom:\n\n*   Install a tub or shower seat\n*   Add handrails\n*   Use anti-skid mats\n\nAvoid letting them use razors with blades; electric razors are safer for shaving. Remind them to brush their teeth at least twice a day.\n\nFor clothing, opt for easy-to-put-on and take-off garments. Limit choices about what to wear, and consider using velcro instead of buttons and zippers. As dementia progresses, suggest pullover clothes and slip-on shoes.\n\n---\n\n**Dementia - Daily Care**\n\n**Part 3/4**\n\n**Nutrition and Hydration**\n\n*   People with dementia may have trouble eating due to decreased smell and taste.\n*   Try different foods to find what they enjoy.\n*   In later stages, the person may need a diet of only liquid or soft foods to prevent choking.\n\n**Tips for Talking To Someone With Dementia**\n\n*   Keep distractions and noise down:\n    *   Turn off the radio or TV\n    *   Close the curtains\n    *   Move to a quieter room\n*   Make eye contact before touching or speaking to them.\n*   Use simple words and sentences, speak slowly, and in a quiet voice.\n*   Repeat your words if needed.\n*   Use names and places the person knows.\n*   Avoid using pronouns like \"he,\" \"she,\" and \"them.\"\n*   Tell them when you are going to change the subject.\n\n**Personal Grooming**\n\n*   People with dementia may need help with personal care and grooming.\n*   Their bathroom should be nearby and easy to find.\n*   Consider leaving the bathroom door open so they can see it.\n*   Suggest that they visit the bathroom several times a day.\n*   Make sure their bathroom is warm.\n*   Get them undergarments made for urine or stool leakage.\n*   Clean them well after going to the bathroom.\n*   Be gentle when helping and try to respect their dignity.\n\n**Safety in the Bathroom**\n\n*   Common safety devices include:\n    *   A tub or shower seat\n    *   Handrails\n    *   Anti-skid mats\n\n**Clothing and Personal Care**\n\n*   A person with dementia should have clothing that is easy to put on and take off.\n*   Avoid giving them too many choices about what to wear.\n*   Velcro is easier than buttons and zippers to use.\n*   If they still wear clothes with buttons and zippers, they should be in the front.\n*   Get them pullover clothes and slip-on shoes as their dementia gets worse.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Alzheimer's Association website.

They may react in different ways.\n\n*   They may be aware they are having problems, and they may be relieved to stop driving.\n*   They may feel their independence is being taken away and object to stopping driving.\n\n**Signs That Driving May No Longer Be Safe**\n\nPeople with signs of dementia should have regular driving tests. Even if they pass a driving test, they should be retested in 6 months.\n\nIf your loved one does not want you getting involved in their driving, get help from their health care provider, lawyer, or other family members.\n\nEven before you see driving problems in someone with dementia, look for signs that the person may not be able to drive safely, such as:\n\n*   Forgetting recent events\n*   Mood swings or getting angry more easily\n*   Problems doing more than one task at a time\n*   Problems judging distance\n*   Trouble making decisions and solving problems\n*   Becoming confused more easily\n\nSigns that driving may be getting more dangerous include:\n\n*   Getting lost on familiar roads\n*   Reacting more slowly in traffic\n*   Driving too slowly or stopping for no reason\n*   Not noticing or paying attention to traffic signs\n*   Taking chances on the road\n*   Drifting into other lanes\n*   Getting more agitated in traffic\n*   Getting scrapes or dents on the car\n*   Having trouble parking\n\n**Steps to Take**\n\nIt may help to set limits when driving problems start.\n\nStay off busy roads, or do not drive at times of the day when traffic is heaviest.\nDo not drive at night when it is hard to see landmarks.\nDo not drive when the weather is bad.\nDo not drive long distances.\nDrive only on roads the person is used to.\n\nCaregivers should try to lessen the person's need to drive without making them feel isolated. Have someone deliver groceries, meals, or prescriptions to their home. Find a barber or hairdresser who will make home visits. Arrange for family and friends to visit and take them out for a few hours at a time.\n\nPlan other ways to get your loved one to places where they need to go. Family members or friends, buses, taxis, rideshares, and senior transportation services may be available.\n\nAs danger to others or to your loved one increases, you may need to prevent them from being able to use the car. Ways to do this include:\n\n*   Storing the car keys in a place that is not known or not accessible to the individual\n*   Disabling car keys so that the car will not start\n*   Disabling the car so it will not start\n*   Selling the car\n*   Storing the car away from the home\n\n---\n\n**Dementia and Driving**\n\nPeople with signs of dementia should have regular driving tests.

As people with dementia age, they may experience cognitive decline that affects their ability to drive safely.\n\n**Assessing Fitness to Drive**\n\nDoctors often struggle to determine when a patient with dementia should stop driving. A study published in the International Psychogeriatrics journal found that 71% of patients with dementia were still driving at the time of diagnosis (Carr et al., 2015). This highlights the need for early identification and intervention.\n\n**Resources for Patients and Families**\n\nThe National Institute on Aging provides guidance on driving safety and Alzheimer's disease. The organization recommends that patients with dementia consider the following:\n\n*   Are you experiencing memory loss or other cognitive symptoms that affect your ability to drive?\n*   Have you noticed any changes in your behavior while driving, such as speeding or getting lost?\n*   Do you feel comfortable driving in heavy traffic or at night?\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\nIf you are a patient with dementia, consider the following:\n\n*   Communicate openly with your doctor about your driving habits and any concerns you may have.\n*   Be honest with yourself about your ability to drive safely.\n*   Consider seeking support from family members or caregivers who can provide an objective assessment of your driving abilities.\n\n**References**\n\nCarr DB, O'Neill D.

    "content": "**Dementia due to Metabolic Causes**\n\nDementia is loss of brain function that occurs with certain diseases. Dementia may also be referred to as major neurocognitive disorder.\n\n**What is Dementia due to Metabolic Causes?**\n\nDementia due to metabolic causes is a loss of brain function that can occur with abnormal chemical processes in the body. With some of these disorders, if treated early, brain dysfunction can be reversed. Left untreated, permanent brain damage, such as dementia, can occur.\n\n**Causes of Dementia due to Metabolic Causes**\n\nPossible metabolic causes of dementia include:\n\n*   Hormonal disorders, such as Addison disease, Cushing disease\n*   Heavy metal exposure, such as to lead, arsenic, mercury, or manganese\n*   Repeat episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), most often seen in people with diabetes who use insulin\n*   High level of calcium in the blood, such as due to hyperparathyroidism\n*   Low level of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) or high level of thyroid hormone (thyrotoxicosis) in the body\n*   Liver cirrhosis\n*   Kidney failure\n*   Nutritional disorders, such as vitamin B1 deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, pellagra, or protein-calorie malnutrition\n*   Porphyria\n*   Poisons, such as methanol\n*   Severe alcohol use\n*   Wilson disease\n*   Disorders of the mitochondria (energy-producing parts of cells)\n*   Rapid changes in blood sodium level\n\n**Symptoms of Dementia due to Metabolic Causes**\n\nMetabolic disorders may cause confusion and changes in thinking or reasoning. These changes may be short-term or lasting. Dementia occurs when the symptoms are not reversible. Symptoms can be different for everyone. They depend on the health condition causing the dementia.\n\nThe early symptoms of dementia can include:\n\n*   Difficulty with tasks that take some thought but used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing games (such as bridge), and learning new information or routines\n*   Getting lost on familiar routes\n*   Language problems, such as trouble with names of familiar objects\n*   Losing interest in things previously enjoyed, flat mood\n*   Misplacing items\n*   Personality changes and loss of social skills, which can lead to inappropriate behaviors\n*   Mood changes that can cause periods of aggression and anxiety\n*   Poor performance at work resulting in demotion or loss of job\n\nAs the dementia gets worse, symptoms are more obvious and interfere with the ability to take care of yourself:\n\n*   Changing sleep patterns, often waking up at night\n*   Forgetting details about current events, forgetting events in one's life history\n*   Having difficulty doing basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, or driving\n*   Having hallucinations, (for example, seeing or hearing things that are not there), arguments, striking out, and behaving violently\n*   More difficulty reading or writing\n*   Poor judgment and losing the ability to recognize danger\n*   Using the wrong word, not pronouncing words correctly, speaking in confusing sentences\n*   Withdrawing from social contact\n\nThe person may also have symptoms from the disorder that caused dementia.\n\n**Exams and Tests for Dementia due to Metabolic Causes**\n\nDepending on the cause, a nervous system (neurologic) examination is done to identify the problems.\n\nTests to diagnose a medical condition causing the dementia may include:\n\n*   Ammonia level in the blood\n*   Blood chemistry, electrolytes\n*   Blood glucose level\n*   BUN, creatinine to check kidney function\n*   Liver function tests\n*   Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to measure chemistry of the spinal fluid\n*   Nutritional assessment\n*   Thyroid function tests\n*   Urinalysis\n*   Vitamin B12 level\n\nTo check for certain brain disorders, an electroencephalogram (EEG), head CT scan, or head MRI scan is usually done.\n\n**Treatment and Outlook for Dementia due to Metabolic Causes**\n\nThe aim of treatment is to manage and correct the underlying disorder and control symptoms. With some metabolic disorders, treatment may stop or even reverse the dementia symptoms.\n\nMedicines used to treat Alzheimer disease have not been shown to work for these types of disorders. Sometimes, these medicines are used anyway, when other treatments fail to control the underlying problems.\n\nPlans should also be made for home care for people with dementia.\n\nOutcome varies, depending on the cause of the dementia and the amount of damage to the brain.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include the following:\n\n*   Loss of ability to function or care for self\n*   Loss of ability to interact\n*   Pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and skin infections\n*   Pressure sores\n*   Symptoms of the underlying problem (such as loss of sensation due to a nerve injury from vitamin B12 deficiency)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if symptoms get worse or continue. Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if there is a sudden change in mental status or a life-threatening emergency.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTreating the underlying cause may reduce the risk for metabolic dementia.\n\n---\n\n**Dementia due to metabolic causes**\n\nDementia is loss of brain function that occurs with certain diseases.

    "content": "**Dementia**\n\n**What is dementia?**\n\nDementia is a loss of mental functions that is severe enough to affect your daily life and activities. These functions include:\n\n* Memory\n* Language skills\n* Visual perception (your ability to make sense of what you see)\n* Problem solving\n* Trouble with everyday tasks\n* The ability to focus and pay attention\n\nIt is normal to become a bit more forgetful as you age. But dementia is not a normal part of aging. It is a serious disorder that interferes with your daily life.\n\n**What are the types of dementia?**\n\nThe most common types of dementia are known as neurodegenerative disorders. These are diseases in which the cells of the brain stop working or die. They include:\n\n* Alzheimer's disease, which is the most common form of dementia among older people.\n* Lewy body dementia, which causes movement symptoms along with dementia.\n* Frontotemporal disorders, which cause changes to certain parts of the brain:\n\t+ Changes in the frontal lobe lead to behavioral symptoms\n\t+ Changes in the temporal lobe lead to language and emotional disorders\n* Vascular dementia, which involves changes to the brain's blood supply. It is often caused by a stroke or atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) in the brain.\n* Mixed dementia, which is a combination of two or more types of dementia.\n\nOther conditions can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms, including:\n\n* Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare brain disorder\n* Huntington's disease, an inherited, progressive brain disease\n* Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), caused by repeated traumatic brain injury\n* HIV-associated dementia (HAD)\n\n**Who is at risk for dementia?**\n\nCertain factors can raise your risk for developing dementia, including:\n\n* Aging. This is the biggest risk factor for dementia.\n* Smoking\n* Uncontrolled diabetes\n* High blood pressure\n* Drinking too much alcohol\n* Having close family members who have dementia\n\n**What are the symptoms of dementia?**\n\nThe symptoms of dementia can vary, depending on which parts of the brain are affected. Often, forgetfulness is the first symptom. Dementia also causes problems with the ability to think, problem solve, and reason. For example, people with dementia may:\n\n* Get lost in a familiar neighborhood\n* Use unusual words to refer to familiar objects\n* Forget the name of a close family member or friend\n* Forget old memories\n* Need help doing tasks that they used to do by themselves\n\nSome people with dementia cannot control their emotions and their personalities may change. They may become apathetic, meaning that they are no longer interested in normal daily activities or events. They may lose their inhibitions and stop caring about other peoples' feelings.\n\nCertain types of dementia can also cause problems with balance and movement.\n\n**How is dementia diagnosed?**\n\nYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\n\n* A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms\n* A physical exam\n* Tests of your thinking, memory, and language abilities\n* Other tests, such as blood tests, genetic tests, and brain scans\n* A mental health evaluation to see whether a mental disorder is contributing to your symptoms\n\n**What are the treatments for dementia?**\n\nThere is no cure for most types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia. Treatments may help to maintain mental function longer, manage behavioral symptoms, and slow down the symptoms of disease. They may include:\n\n* Medicines, which may temporarily improve memory and thinking or slow down their decline.\n* Occupational therapy to help find ways to more easily do everyday activities\n* Speech therapy to help with swallowing difficulties and trouble speaking loudly and clearly\n* Mental health counseling to help people with dementia and their families learn how to manage difficult emotions and behaviors. It can also help them plan for the future.\n* Music or art therapy to reduce anxiety and improve well-being\n\n---\n\n**Dementia**\n\nDementia is a loss of mental functions that is severe enough to affect your daily life and activities.

For example, people with dementia may:\n\n*   Get lost in a familiar neighborhood\n*   Use unusual words to refer to familiar objects\n*   Forget the name of a close family member or friend\n*   Forget old memories\n*   Need help doing tasks that they used to do by themselves\n\nSome people with dementia cannot control their emotions and their personalities may change. They may become apathetic, meaning that they are no longer interested in normal daily activities or events. They may lose their inhibitions and stop caring about other peoples' feelings.\n\nCertain types of dementia can also cause problems with balance and movement.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Stages of Dementia**\n\nThe stages of dementia range from mild to severe. In the mildest stage, it is just beginning to affect a person's functioning. In the most severe stage, the person is completely dependent on others for care.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis of Dementia**\n\nYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\n\n*   A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms\n*   A physical exam\n*   Tests of your thinking, memory, and language abilities\n*   Other tests, such as blood tests, genetic tests, and brain scans\n*   A mental health evaluation to see whether a mental disorder is contributing to your symptoms\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment of Dementia**\n\nThere is no cure for most types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia. Treatments may help to maintain mental function longer, manage behavioral symptoms, and slow down the symptoms of disease. They may include:\n\n*   Medicines, which may temporarily improve memory and thinking or slow down their decline\n*   Occupational therapy to help find ways to more easily do everyday activities\n*   Speech therapy to help with swallowing difficulties and trouble speaking loudly and clearly\n*   Mental health counseling to help people with dementia and their families learn how to manage difficult emotions and behaviors\n*   Music or art therapy to reduce anxiety and improve well-being\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention of Dementia**\n\nResearchers have not found a proven way to prevent dementia.

These conditions include:\n\n* Anemia\n* Brain tumor\n* Long-term (chronic) infection\n* Intoxication from medicines\n* Severe depression\n* Thyroid disease\n* Vitamin deficiency\n\nThe following tests and procedures may be done:\n\n* B12 level\n* Blood ammonia level\n* Blood chemistry (chem-20)\n* Blood gas analysis\n* Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis\n* Drug or alcohol levels (toxicology screen)\n* Electroencephalograph (EEG)\n* Head CT\n* Lumbar puncture (spinal tap)\n* Mental status test\n* Neuropsychological test\n* MRI of head\n* Thyroid function tests, including thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)\n* Urinalysis\n* Genetic tests\n* PET scan\n\n---\n\n**Dementia**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment depends on the condition causing the dementia. Some people may need to stay in the hospital for a short time.\n\nSometimes, medicines given for any condition, including dementia, can make a person's confusion worse. Stopping or changing these medicines is part of the treatment.\n\nCertain mental exercises can help with dementia.\n\nTreating conditions that can lead to dementia symptoms often greatly improve mental function. Such conditions include:\n\n* Anemia\n* Decreased blood oxygen (hypoxia)\n* Depression\n* Heart failure\n* Infections\n* Nutritional disorders\n* Thyroid disorders\n\nMedicines may be used to:\n\n* Slow the rate at which symptoms get worse, though improvement with these medicines may be small\n* Control problems with behavior, such as loss of judgment or confusion\n\nNewer treatments can reduce levels of amyloid in the brains of people with Alzheimer disease. While they offer hope, they haven’t been proven to slow the disease.\n\nSomeone with dementia will need support in the home as the condition gets worse. Family members or other caregivers can assist by helping the person cope with memory loss and behavior and sleep problems. It is important to make sure the homes of people who have dementia are safe for them.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nPeople with MCI do not always develop dementia. When dementia does occur, it usually gets worse over time. Dementia often decreases quality of life and lifespan. Families will likely need to plan for their loved one's future care. The prognosis depends on the underlying cause. Some dementias rapidly progress to death while others can take years to get worse.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* Dementia symptoms develop or a sudden change in mental status occurs\n* The condition of a person with dementia gets worse\n* You are unable to care for a person with dementia at home\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nMost causes of dementia are not preventable.\n\nThe risk of vascular dementia may be reduced by preventing strokes through:\n\n* Eating healthy foods\n* Exercising\n* Quitting smoking\n* Controlling high blood pressure\n* Managing diabetes\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nLewy body dementia; DLB; Vascular dementia; Mild cognitive impairment; MCI; Alzheimer disease - dementia\n\n---\n\n**Dementia**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Alzheimer Disease and Other Dementias**\n\nAlzheimer disease and other dementias.

    "content": "**Dengue Fever Test**\n\n\\n\\n**What is Dengue Fever?**\n\nDengue fever is a viral infection spread to people through bites from infected mosquitoes. You can't catch the virus from a person who is sick with dengue fever.\n\n\\n\\n**Why Do I Need a Dengue Fever Test?**\n\nYou may need to be tested for the dengue virus if you have symptoms of dengue fever and have been in an area where the virus is common. Symptoms usually show up four to ten days after being bitten by an infected mosquito.\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms of Dengue Fever**\n\nSymptoms of dengue fever include:\n\n*   A sudden high fever (104°F or higher)\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Rash\n*   Eye pain, typically behind the eyes\n*   Headache\n*   Joint, bone or muscle pain\n\n\\n\\n**What Happens During a Dengue Fever Test?**\n\nYour health care provider will ask about your symptoms and your recent travels. If an infection is suspected, you will get a blood test to check for the dengue virus.\n\nDuring a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n\\n\\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a dengue fever test.\n\n\\n\\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nIf you had a molecular test (a PCR test):\n\n*   A positive test result means that the test found genetic material from the virus in your blood sample. You most likely have a dengue infection.\n*   A negative test result means that the dengue virus wasn't found in your blood sample. You probably don't have dengue. But it's possible that there wasn't enough virus in your blood sample for the test to find.\n\nIf you had an antibody test, your test results may be reported as positive or negative. Or they may be given as a measurement of the dengue antibodies found in your blood sample.\n\n\\n\\n**How Do I Treat Dengue Fever?**\n\nIn general, care for dengue fever includes:\n\n*   Getting plenty of rest.\n*   Drinking lots of fluids.\n*   Taking acetaminophen to control fever and relieve pain. Do not take aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen sodium, because they can increase the risk of bleeding.\n*   Watching carefully for symptoms of severe dengue. Dengue fever can become severe within hours. Get medical help right away if you develop the symptoms of severe dengue.\n\n\\n\\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About a Dengue Fever Test?**\n\nA vaccine is available for children ages 9 to 16 who:\n\n*   Have already had dengue fever. The vaccine helps protect against future dengue infections or from getting severe dengue disease. Before getting the vaccine, a child must have a blood test to confirm a past dengue infection. That's because the vaccine can be harmful to a child who has never had dengue fever.\n*   Live in areas where dengue is common. These areas include Puerto Rico, the U.S, Virgin Islands, the U.S. territories of American Samoa, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau. The vaccine isn't approved for children traveling to these areas to visit.\n\nIf you travel to an area where dengue is common, you can reduce the risk of infection by preventing mosquito bites.\n\n---\n\n**Dengue Fever Test**\n\n\\n\\nA dengue fever test checks a sample of your blood to see if you have the virus. The test is used if you have symptoms of dengue fever and have been in an area where mosquitos carry the virus.\n\n**Where is Dengue Fever Common?**\n\nThe dengue virus is most common in parts of the world with tropical and subtropical climates, including:\n\n*   South and Central America\n*   The Caribbean, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands\n*   Asia\n*   The Middle East\n*   The Pacific Islands\n*   Africa\n\n**Outbreaks in the US**\n\nOutbreaks of dengue fever are rare in the U.S. mainland. But small outbreaks have been reported in parts of Florida and Texas.\n\n**Symptoms of Dengue Fever**\n\nMost people who get the dengue virus won't become sick. People who do get sick may have mild to severe symptoms that usually begin four to ten days after a bite from an infected mosquito. The most common symptom is a sudden high fever. There is no specific medicine that can cure or treat dengue fever, but most people will recover after about a week.\n\nSome people who get sick with dengue will develop severe dengue disease. Severe dengue can cause internal bleeding and shock, which can be life-threatening.\n\nInfants and pregnant women have a higher risk for developing severe dengue. The risk is also higher for people who have had dengue and then get it again. That's why it's so important to get a dengue fever test if you have symptoms after being in an area where the virus is common.\n\n**Types of Dengue Fever Blood Tests**\n\nThere are two main types of dengue fever blood tests:\n\n*   Antibody tests check your blood sample for proteins, called antibodies, that your immune system makes to fight viruses and other germs. Your body needs time to make specific antibodies to fight dengue. So, these tests are most accurate when they are done four days or more after your symptoms begin.\n*   Molecular tests look for genetic material from the dengue virus in your blood sample. A PCR test (polymerase chain reaction) is a type of molecular test that's used to check for dengue. These tests can be done during the first seven days after your symptoms begin. Tests done later than that may not have accurate results.\n\n**Why Do I Need a Dengue Fever Test?**\n\nYou may need to be tested for the dengue virus if you have symptoms of dengue fever and have been in an area where the virus is common. Symptoms usually show up four to ten days after being bitten by an infected mosquito.\n\nSymptoms of dengue fever include a sudden high fever (104°F or higher) with any of these other symptoms:\n\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Rash\n*   Eye pain, typically behind the eyes\n*   Headache\n*   Joint, bone or muscle pain\n\nSymptoms of severe dengue may begin 24 to 48 hours after the fever has gone away. Get medical help right away if you or a family member has any of these warning signs of severe dengue:\n\n*   Abdominal (belly) pain or tenderness\n*   Vomiting (at least 3 times in 24 hours)\n*   Bleeding from the nose or gums\n*   Vomiting blood or blood in stool (poop)\n*   Feeling tired, restlessness, or irritable\n\n**What Happens During a Dengue Fever Test?**\n\nYour health care provider will ask about your symptoms and your recent travels. If an infection is suspected, you will get a blood test to check for the dengue virus.\n\nDuring a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a dengue fever test.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nIf you had a molecular test (a PCR test), your provider will look for genetic material from the dengue virus in your blood sample. If they find the virus, it means you have dengue fever. If they don't find the virus, it doesn't necessarily mean you're clear - the test might not have been accurate if done too late after symptoms started.\n\nIn that case, your provider may order another test or recommend treatment based on your symptoms and medical history.\n\n---\n\n**Dengue Fever Test**\n\nIf you're diagnosed with dengue fever, your provider can tell you how to treat your symptoms. Always follow their instructions.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\n* **Molecular test (PCR test):**\n\t+ Positive result: The test found genetic material from the virus in your blood sample. You most likely have a dengue infection.\n\t+ Negative result: The dengue virus wasn't found in your blood sample. You probably don't have dengue, but it's possible that there wasn't enough virus for the test to detect. If this is the case, your provider may order an antibody test to confirm that you don't have dengue.\n* **Antibody test:**\n\t+ Positive result: Antibodies for the dengue virus were found. You probably have a dengue infection, but another test may be needed to confirm the results. This is because the antibody test may also detect antibodies against other similar viruses carried by mosquitoes.\n\t+ Negative result: Dengue antibodies weren't found in your blood sample. Dengue may not be causing your symptoms. However, a negative result could mean that you were tested before your body had time to produce enough antibodies to show on the test. In this case, your provider may order another antibody test to check again.\n\n**Treating dengue fever:**\n\n* Get plenty of rest.\n* Drink lots of fluids.\n* Take acetaminophen to control fever and relieve pain. Do not take aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen sodium, as they can increase the risk of bleeding.\n* Watch carefully for symptoms of severe dengue. Dengue fever can become severe within hours. Get medical help right away if you develop these symptoms.\n\n**Preventing mosquito bites:**\n\nIf you travel to an area where dengue is common, you can reduce the risk of infection by preventing mosquito bites.\n\n**Vaccine availability:**\n\nA vaccine is available for children ages 9 to 16 who:\n\n* Have already had dengue fever. The vaccine helps protect against future dengue infections or severe dengue disease.\n* Live in areas where dengue is common, such as Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and other territories.\n\n**References:**\n\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n* Mayo Clinic\n* Merck Manual Consumer Version\n* Johns Hopkins Medicine\n* StatPearls\n* Testing.com\n* UF Health: University of Florida Health\n* University of Rochester Medical Center\n* UW Health\n* World Health Organization\n\n---\n\n**Dengue Fever Test**\n\n\\n\\n**What is it?**\n\nA test to diagnose dengue fever, a mosquito-borne illness that can cause severe flu-like symptoms.\n\n\\n\\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Chikungunya\n* Dengue\n* Mosquito Bites\n* Shock\n* Zika Virus\n\n\\n\\n**Related Medical Tests**\n\n* How to Cope with Medical Test Anxiety\n* How to Understand Your Lab Results\n* Malaria Tests\n* PCR Tests\n* What You Need to Know About Blood Testing\n* Zika Virus Test",

Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n**Brand names**\n\nDenosumab injection is available as several different products that are considered to be biologic medications (medications made from living organisms). These biosimilar products are highly similar to denosumab injection and work the same way as denosumab injection in the body.\n\n---\n\n**Denosumab Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Patient Information Sheet (Medication Guide)**\n\nWhen you begin treatment with denosumab injection products, read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.

You will need to have a negative pregnancy test before starting treatment with denosumab injection products. You should not become pregnant while you are receiving denosumab injection products. You should use a reliable method of birth control to prevent pregnancy while you are receiving denosumab injection products and for at least 5 months after your final treatment. If you become pregnant while receiving denosumab injection products, or within 5 months of your treatment, call your doctor immediately. Denosumab may harm the fetus.\n*   You should know that denosumab injection products may cause osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ, a serious condition of the jaw bone), especially if you have dental surgery or treatment while you are receiving this medication. A dentist should examine your teeth and perform any needed treatments, including cleaning or fixing ill-fitted dentures, before you start to receive a denosumab injection product. Be sure to brush your teeth and clean your mouth properly while you are receiving denosumab injection products. Talk to your doctor before having any dental treatments while you are receiving this medication.\n\n**What Special Dietary Instructions Should I Follow?**\n\n*   Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n**What Should I Do If I Forget a Dose?**\n\n*   Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it.

Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* red, dry, or itchy skin\n* oozing or crusty blisters on skin\n* peeling skin\n* back pain\n* pain in your arms and legs\n* swelling of arms or legs\n* muscle or joint pain\n* nausea\n* diarrhea\n* constipation\n* abdominal pain\n* headache\n* runny nose\n\nSome side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms or those listed in the IMPORTANT WARNING section, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment:\n\n* hives, rash, itching, difficulty breathing or swallowing, swelling of the face, eyes, throat, tongue or lips,\n* fever or chills\n* redness, tenderness, swelling or warmth of area of skin\n* fever, cough, shortness of breath\n* ear drainage or severe ear pain\n* frequent or urgent need to urinate, burning feeling when you urinate\n* severe abdominal pain\n* painful or swollen gums, loosening of the teeth, numbness or heavy feeling in the jaw, poor healing of the jaw\n* unusual bleeding or bruising\n* nausea, vomiting, headache, and decreased alertness after stopping denosumab and for up to 1 year afterwards\n* new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain\n\nDenosumab injection products may increase the risk that you will break your thigh bone(s). You may feel pain in your hips, groin, or thighs for several weeks or months before the bone(s) break, and you may find that one or both of your thigh bones have broken even though you have not fallen or experienced other trauma. It is unusual for the thigh bone to break in healthy people, but people who have osteoporosis may break this bone even if they do not receive denosumab injection products. Denosumab injection products may also cause broken bones to heal slowly and may impair bone growth and prevent teeth from coming in properly in children. Denosumab injection products may also increase the risk of spinal (back) fractures months to years after your treatment is discontinued. Tell your doctor if you have ever had a broken bone in your spine. Your doctor will probably tell you to take another medication to prevent fractures after you stop receiving denosumab injection products. Talk to your doctor about the risks of receiving denosumab injection products.\n\nDenosumab injection products may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while receiving this medication.\n\n---\n\n**Denosumab Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Side Effects**\n\nDenosumab injection products may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while receiving this medication.\n\nIf you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online or by phone.\n\n**Increased Risk of Broken Bones**\n\nDenosumab injection products may increase the risk that you will break your thigh bone(s). You may feel pain in your hips, groin, or thighs for several weeks or months before the bone(s) break, and you may find that one or both of your thigh bones have broken even though you have not fallen or experienced other trauma.

    "content": "**Dental Exam**\n\nA dental exam is part of a checkup of your teeth and gums. When you see your dentist for a checkup, the visit usually includes three parts:\n\n* A dental cleaning to remove the buildup of plaque, a sticky film of bacteria that coats your teeth\n* X-rays of your teeth on certain visits, depending on the health of your teeth\n* An exam of your teeth and mouth by a dentist\n\n**Why is a Dental Exam Important?**\n\nDental exams are important for protecting your oral health. Oral health includes your teeth, gums, and all the muscles and bones that let you smile, speak, and chew. Common oral health problems, such as tooth decay (cavities) and gum disease (periodontal disease), can lead to pain, infection, and tooth loss.\n\nPoor oral health can affect your general health, too. For example, losing teeth can cause problems with eating and nutrition, which can lead to other health problems. You can help prevent oral health problems with regular visits to the dentist and good toothbrushing and flossing habits at home.\n\n**Who Will I See During a Dental Exam?**\n\nAt a dental checkup, you'll usually see both a dentist and a dental hygienist. A dentist is a doctor who has special training to care for teeth and gums. A dental hygienist is a health care professional trained to clean teeth and teach you how to take good care of your teeth and gums.\n\nDentists can treat people of all ages. There are also pediatric dentists who have received additional training on dental care for children.\n\n**How Often Should I Have a Dental Exam?**\n\nAsk your dentist or hygienist how often you should have exams. Most adults and children need to have a routine dental exam every six months. You may need more frequent dental exams if you:\n\n* Have gum disease\n* Get a lot of cavities\n* Have a family history of oral health problems\n* Have a health condition that may increase your risk for oral health problems, such as:\n\t+ Diabetes\n\t+ Heart disease\n\t+ HIV\n\t+ Conditions that affect your immune system\n\t+ Take medicines that make your mouth dry\n\t+ Smoke\n\t+ Are pregnant, which increases your risk for gum disease\n\n**What Happens During a Dental Exam?**\n\nAt a typical dental exam, a hygienist will clean your teeth. Then the dentist will examine your mouth. At certain visits, you may have x-rays of your teeth before the dentist examines you.\n\nDental x-rays can show hidden cavities, gum disease, bone loss in your jaw, and other problems that can't be seen by looking in your mouth. Ask your dentist how often you need x-rays.\n\nFor a dental cleaning:\n\n* The first step is called \"scaling.\" The hygienist will use small, metal tools to scrape plaque and tartar from your teeth:\n\t+ Plaque is a film of bacteria that begins to coat your teeth soon after you eat. Brushing and flossing removes plaque, but not all of it. If you let plaque build up on your teeth, it can cause cavities and destroy the tissue and bone around your teeth, leading to tooth loss.\n\t+ Tartar is a hard substance that can form over time from plaque that's not removed from your teeth. Tartar can build up along your gumline and cause red, swollen gums (gingivitis). This can lead to more serious gum infections and tooth loss.\n* Next the hygienist will polish your teeth, using a device like an electric toothbrush with a rubber tip. The polishing is done with a special paste that's slightly gritty.\n* After the polishing, the hygienist will floss your teeth.\n* When needed, the hygienist may apply a fluoride gel or foam, or dental sealants to your teeth:\n\t+ Fluoride is a mineral that prevents tooth decay (cavities). Fluoride treatments are given to children more often than adults.\n\t+ Sealants are thin coatings painted on the chewing surfaces of the back teeth. They can help prevent cavities for many years by keeping food and bacteria out of the grooves in the teeth.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to a Dental Exam?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a dental exam. The cleaning may be uncomfortable, but it's usually not painful.\n\nDental x-rays are safe for most people. The dose of radiation in an x-ray is very low. But x-rays are not recommended during pregnancy, unless it's an emergency. Be sure to tell your dentist if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.\n\n---\n\n**Dental Exam**\n\nA dental exam is part of a checkup of your teeth and gums.

Your upper body will be covered with a heavy lead apron to protect you from radiation.\n2. You'll bite down on a piece of plastic and an x-ray scanner will be positioned near your cheek.\n3. The hygienist will leave the room or stand behind a protective shield to take the x-ray, which only takes a few seconds.\n\nFor the dentist's exam:\n\n* The dentist will examine your mouth, including your teeth, gums, and other oral health structures.\n* The dentist may perform additional procedures, such as fillings or extractions, if necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Dental Exam: MedlinePlus Medical Test**\n\n**Part 3/4**\n\n**The X-Ray Process**\n\nLeave the room or stand behind a protective shield to take the x-ray, which only takes a few seconds. You'll repeat these steps a few times to get x-rays of all your teeth.\n\n**For the Dentist's Exam**\n\nIf you had x-rays, your dentist will check them for problems. Next, your dentist will:\n\n* Examine your teeth and gums.\n* Check your bite, which is the way your top and bottom teeth fit together. If you have a bite problem, you may be referred to an orthodontist.\n* Check you for oral cancer. This involves looking and feeling for unusual lumps in your mouth, including on your lips and tongue. Your dentist may also check your face and neck.\n\nAt a typical dental exam, a hygienist will clean your teeth. Then the dentist will examine your mouth. At certain visits, you may have x-rays of your teeth before the dentist examines you.\n\nDental x-rays can show hidden cavities, gum disease, bone loss in your jaw, and other problems that can't be seen by looking in your mouth. Ask your dentist how often you need x-rays.\n\n**For a Dental Cleaning**\n\nIf dental x-rays are needed:\n\n* For the dentist's exam:\nWill I need to do anything to prepare for a dental exam?\n\nIf you have certain health conditions, you may need to take antibiotics before your exam to prevent infections. Ask your dentist and/or your health care provider whether you need antibiotics, especially if you have heart problems or an immune system disorder.\n\nSome people feel anxious about going to the dentist. If you or your child feels this way, tell your dentist before your visit. Your dentist can discuss ways to help you feel more relaxed about getting dental care.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to a Dental Exam?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a dental exam. The cleaning may be uncomfortable, but it's usually not painful.\n\nDental x-rays are safe for most people. The dose of radiation in an x-ray is very low. But x-rays are not recommended during pregnancy, unless it's an emergency. Be sure to tell your dentist if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nAfter your dental exam, your dentist will discuss any oral health problems you may have and your treatment options. For certain problems, improving your brushing and flossing habits may be all that's needed.\n\nIf you or your child has a cavity or a more serious problem, you'll probably need to make another appointment with the dentist to treat it.\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About a Dental Exam?**\n\nYou can help keep your teeth for your lifetime by getting regular dental exams and taking good care of your teeth and gums. For a healthy mouth and strong teeth:\n\n* Brush your teeth twice a day using a soft-bristled brush and toothpaste with fluoride.\n* Clean between your teeth regularly using dental floss, a special brush, or a plastic pick. Your dentist can suggest the best way to do this.\n* Replace your toothbrush every three or four months.\n* Eat a healthy diet and limit sweets and sugary drinks. If you do have sweets, brush your teeth soon afterwards.\n* Drink fluoridated water.\n* Don't smoke. Smoking increases your risk for gum disease.\n\n**References**\n\nHealthyChildren.org [Internet].

    "content": "**Dental Care for Adults**\n\nTooth decay and gum disease are caused by plaque, a sticky combination of bacteria and food. Plaque begins to build up on teeth within a few minutes after eating. If teeth are not cleaned well each day, plaque will lead to tooth decay or gum disease.\n\n**The Consequences of Poor Dental Care**\n\nIf you do not remove plaque, it turns into a hard deposit called tartar that becomes trapped at the base of the tooth. Plaque and tartar irritate and inflame the gums. Bacteria and the body's inflammatory response to it cause the gums to become:\n\n* Infected\n* Swollen\n* Tender\n\nBy taking good care of your teeth and gums, you can help prevent problems such as tooth decay (caries) and gum disease (gingivitis or periodontitis). You should also teach your children how to brush and floss from an early age to help them protect their teeth.\n\n**The Problems Caused by Plaque and Tartar**\n\nPlaque and tartar lead to a number of problems:\n\n* Cavities, or tooth decay are holes in the tooth's structure.\n* Gingivitis is red, swollen, inflamed, and bleeding gums.\n* Periodontitis is a gum infection that damages the supporting structures of the teeth, such as the gums, ligaments, and bone, and often leads to tooth loss.\n* Bad breath (halitosis).\n* Abscesses, pain, inability to use your teeth.\n* Other health problems outside the mouth, ranging from preterm labor to heart disease.\n\n**How to Take Care of Your Teeth**\n\nHealthy teeth are clean and have no cavities. Healthy gums are pink and firm, and do not bleed. To maintain healthy teeth and gums, follow these steps:\n\n* Floss at least once per day.\n* Brush your teeth twice a day with a soft-bristled toothbrush.\n* Use fluoride toothpaste.\n* Replace your toothbrush every 3 to 4 months or sooner if needed.\n* Eat a healthy diet.\n* Avoid sweets and sweetened drinks.\n* Do not smoke.\n* Keep dentures, retainers, and other appliances clean.\n\n**When to Contact the Dentist**\n\nContact your dentist if you have symptoms of a cavity that include:\n\n* Pain in the tooth that occurs for no reason or is caused by food, beverages, brushing or flossing\n* Sensitivity to hot or cold foods or drinks\n\nGet early treatment for gum disease. Contact your dentist if you have symptoms of gum disease that include:\n\n* Red or swollen gums\n* Bleeding in the gums when you brush your teeth\n* Bad breath\n* Loose teeth\n* Drifting teeth\n\n---\n\n**Dental Care - Adult**\n\nMaintaining healthy teeth and gums is crucial for overall well-being. Here's how to take care of your teeth:\n\n*   **Floss daily**: Remove plaque from between teeth and on the gums by flossing at least once a day, preferably after brushing.\n*   **Brush twice a day**: Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste to strengthen tooth enamel and prevent decay. Brush for at least 2 minutes each time.\n*   **Replace your toothbrush**: Get a new one every 3-4 months or sooner if the bristles become worn out. If you use an electric toothbrush, change the heads every 3-4 months as well.\n*   **Eat a healthy diet**: A balanced diet helps prevent gum disease.\n*   **Avoid sweets and sweetened drinks**: Limit your consumption of sugary foods and beverages to reduce the risk of cavities.\n*   **Don't smoke**: Smoking is linked to an increased likelihood of teeth and gum problems.\n*   **Keep dentures and appliances clean**: Brush them regularly and soak them in a cleansing solution if necessary.\n*   **Schedule regular checkups**: Visit your dentist every 6 months for professional cleaning, or more frequently if you have unhealthy gums.\n\nBy following these steps, you can maintain healthy teeth and gums and prevent problems like tooth decay and gum disease.\n\n---\n\n**Dental Care - Adult**\n\nAs we've discussed earlier, taking care of your teeth is crucial for maintaining good oral health. In this section, we'll delve deeper into the importance of regular dental check-ups and professional cleanings.\n\n**Regular Dental Check-Ups**\n\nMany dentists recommend having your teeth professionally cleaned every 6 months for optimal oral health. If you have unhealthy gums, you may need to see your dentist more frequently, every 3 to 4 months. Regular check-ups with your dentist can help catch problems early on, preventing them from becoming more serious and expensive to fix.\n\n**Professional Cleanings**\n\nRegular teeth cleaning by a dentist or dental hygienist removes plaque that may develop, even with careful brushing and flossing. This is very important for getting at areas that are hard to reach on your own. Professional cleaning includes scaling and polishing, which uses instruments to loosen and remove deposits from the teeth.\n\n**Ask Your Dentist**\n\nWhen you visit your dentist, be sure to ask:\n\n* What kind of toothbrush you should use, and how to brush your teeth well.\n* How to properly floss your teeth.\n* Whether you should use any special appliances or tools, such as water irrigation.\n* Whether you could benefit from particular toothpastes or mouth rinses.\n\n**When to Contact the Dentist**\n\nContact your dentist if you have symptoms of a cavity that include:\n\n* Pain in the tooth that occurs for no reason or is caused by food, beverages, brushing or flossing\n* Sensitivity to hot or cold foods or drinks\n\nGet early treatment for gum disease. Contact your dentist if you have symptoms of gum disease that include:\n\n* Red or swollen gums\n* Bleeding in the gums when you brush your teeth\n* Bad breath\n* Loose teeth\n* Drifting teeth\n\n---\n\n**Dental Care for Adults**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Developing the Treatment Plan**\n\nWhen it comes to dental care, developing a treatment plan is crucial. This involves identifying the patient's needs and creating a personalized plan to address those needs. As Stefanac SJ notes in his book \"Diagnosis and Treatment Planning in Dentistry\", the treatment plan should be based on the patient's medical history, oral health status, and treatment goals.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Biofilm and Periodontal Microbiology**\n\nUnderstanding biofilm and periodontal microbiology is essential for effective dental care. Teughels W and colleagues explain in their book \"Newman and Carranza's Clinical Periodontology and Implantology\" that biofilms are complex communities of microorganisms that adhere to surfaces, including teeth and gums. These biofilms can lead to various oral health issues if not properly managed.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Infections of the Oral Cavity, Neck, and Head**\n\nDental care is not just about maintaining good oral hygiene; it's also about preventing infections. Chow AW discusses in his book \"Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases\" that infections of the oral cavity, neck, and head can have severe consequences if left untreated.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Bad Breath**\n\nBad breath, also known as halitosis, is a common issue that can be embarrassing for those who suffer from it. According to MedlinePlus, bad breath can be caused by various factors, including poor oral hygiene, gum disease, and dry mouth.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Dental Health**\n\nMaintaining good dental health is essential for overall well-being. As MedlinePlus notes, regular brushing, flossing, and dental check-ups can help prevent issues like gingivitis and periodontitis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Teach Children to Brush**\n\nTeaching children the importance of oral hygiene from a young age is crucial for their future health. Encourage them to brush their teeth at least twice a day and visit the dentist regularly.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Periodontitis**\n\nPeriodontitis is a serious gum infection that can lead to tooth loss if left untreated. According to MedlinePlus, symptoms of periodontitis include red, swollen gums that bleed easily.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Denture Care**\n\nIf you wear dentures, it's essential to take good care of them to prevent issues like denture-related stomatitis. MedlinePlus recommends cleaning your dentures daily with a soft-bristled toothbrush and mild soap.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Gingivitis**\n\nGingivitis is a mild form of gum disease that can be treated with proper oral hygiene and dental care. According to MedlinePlus, symptoms of gingivitis include red, swollen gums that bleed easily.\n\n\\n\\n",

    "content": "**Dental Cavities**\n\nDental cavities are holes (or structural damage) in the teeth.\n\n**Causes**\n\nTooth decay is a very common disorder. It most often occurs in children and young adults, but it can affect anyone. Tooth decay is a common cause of tooth loss in younger people.\n\nBacteria are normally found in your mouth. These bacteria change foods, especially sugar and starch, into acids. Bacteria, acid, food pieces, and saliva combine in the mouth to form a sticky substance called plaque. Plaque sticks to the teeth. It is most common on the back molars, just above the gum line on all teeth, and at the edges of fillings.\n\nPlaque that is not removed from the teeth turns into a substance called tartar, or calculus. Plaque and tartar irritate the gums, resulting in gingivitis and periodontitis.\n\nPlaque begins to build up on teeth within 20 minutes after eating. If it is not removed, it will harden and turn into tartar (calculus).\n\nThe acids in plaque damage the enamel covering your teeth. It also creates holes in the tooth called cavities. Cavities usually do not hurt, unless they grow very large and affect nerves or cause a tooth fracture. An untreated cavity can lead to an infection in the tooth called a tooth abscess. Untreated tooth decay also destroys the inside of the tooth (pulp). This requires more extensive treatment, or possibly removal of the tooth.\n\nCarbohydrates (sugars and starches) increase the risk of tooth decay. Sticky foods are more harmful than non-sticky foods because they remain on the teeth. Frequent snacking increases the time that acids are in contact with the surface of the tooth.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThere may be no symptoms. If symptoms occur, they may include:\n\n* Tooth pain or achy feeling, particularly after sweet or hot or cold foods and drinks\n* Visible pits or holes in the teeth\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nMost cavities are discovered in the early stages during routine dental checkups.\n\nA dental exam may show that the surface of the tooth is soft.\n\nDental x-rays may show some cavities before they can be seen just by looking at the teeth.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment of cavities can help prevent further tooth damage.\n\nTreatment may involve:\n\n* Fillings\n* Crowns\n* Root canals\n\nDentists fill teeth by removing the decayed tooth material with a drill and replacing it with a material such as composite resin, glass ionomer, or amalgam. Composite resin is the preferred material today, as it more closely matches the natural tooth appearance, and is also strong enough to use anywhere in the mouth, including the back teeth, where the majority of chewing takes place.\n\nCrowns or \"caps\" are used if tooth decay is extensive and there is limited tooth structure, which may cause weakened teeth. Large fillings and weak teeth increase the risk of tooth fracture. The decayed or weakened area is removed and repaired. A crown is fitted over the remainder of the tooth. Crowns are often made of gold, porcelain, or porcelain fused to metal.\n\nA root canal is recommended if the pulp is exposed to bacteria, or if the nerve in a tooth dies from decay or injury. The center of the tooth, including the nerve and blood vessel tissue (pulp), is removed along with decayed portions of the tooth. The roots are filled with a sealing material called gutta percha. The tooth is filled, and a crown is needed in most cases to seal and protect the tooth afterward.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nTreatment often saves the tooth. Treatment is less painful and less expensive if it is done early.\n\nYou may need numbing medicine and prescription pain medicines to relieve pain during or after dental work.\n\nNitrous oxide with local anesthetic or other medicines may be an option if you are afraid of dental treatments.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nDental cavities can lead to:\n\n* Discomfort or pain\n* Fractured tooth\n* Inability to bite down on tooth\n* Tooth abscess\n* Tooth sensitivity\n* Infection of the bone\n* Bone loss\n* Tooth loss\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your dentist if you have any tooth pain, discomfort or see dark spots on your teeth.\n\nSee your dentist for a routine cleaning and exam if you have not had one in the last 6 months.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nOral hygiene is necessary to prevent cavities. This consists of regular professional cleaning (every 6 months), brushing at least twice a day, and flossing at least daily. X-rays may be taken yearly to detect possible cavity development in high-risk areas of the mouth.\n\nIt is best to eat chewy, sticky foods (such as dried fruit or candy) as part of a meal rather than alone as a snack. If possible, brush your teeth or rinse your mouth with water after eating these foods. Limit snacking, since it creates a constant supply of sugars in your mouth. Avoid constant sipping of sugary drinks or frequent sucking on candy and mints.\n\nDental sealants can prevent some cavities. Sealants are thin plastic-like coatings applied to the chewing surfaces of the posterior teeth (premolars and molars). This coating prevents the buildup of plaque in the deep grooves on these surfaces. Sealants are often applied on the teeth of children, shortly after their molars come in. Older people may also benefit from tooth sealants.\n\nFluoride is often recommended to protect against tooth decay. People who get fluoride in their drinking water or by taking fluoride supplements have less tooth decay.\n\nTopical fluoride is also recommended to protect the surface of the teeth. This may include a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions (applied to the teeth) as part of routine visits.\n\n---\n\n**Dental Cavities**\n\n_Dental cavities are holes (or structural damage) in the teeth._\n\n**Causes**\n\nTooth decay is a very common disorder. It most often occurs in children and young adults, but it can affect anyone. Tooth decay is a common cause of tooth loss in younger people.\n\nBacteria are normally found in your mouth. These bacteria change foods, especially sugar and starch, into acids. Bacteria, acid, food pieces, and saliva combine in the mouth to form a sticky substance called plaque. Plaque sticks to the teeth. It is most common on the back molars, just above the gum line on all teeth, and at the edges of fillings.\n\nPlaque that is not removed from the teeth turns into a substance called tartar, or calculus. Plaque and tartar irritate the gums, resulting in gingivitis and periodontitis.\n\nPlaque begins to build up on teeth within 20 minutes after eating. If it is not removed, it will harden and turn into tartar (calculus).\n\nThe acids in plaque damage the enamel covering your teeth. It also creates holes in the tooth called cavities. Cavities usually do not hurt, unless they grow very large and affect nerves or cause a tooth fracture. An untreated cavity can lead to an infection in the tooth called a tooth abscess. Untreated tooth decay also destroys the inside of the tooth (pulp). This requires more extensive treatment, or possibly removal of the tooth.\n\nCarbohydrates (sugars and starches) increase the risk of tooth decay. Sticky foods are more harmful than non-sticky foods because they remain on the teeth. Frequent snacking increases the time that acids are in contact with the surface of the tooth.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThere may be no symptoms.

You may need a crown to support a weak tooth or to make your tooth look better.\n\n**Description**\n\nGetting a dental crown usually takes two dental visits.\n\n*   At the first visit, the dentist will:\n    *   Numb the tooth and neighboring teeth and gums around the tooth that is getting the crown so you do not feel anything.\n    *   Remove any old or failing restorations (fillings) or decay from the tooth.\n    *   Reshape your tooth to prepare it for a crown.\n    *   Take an impression of your tooth to send to the dental lab where they make the permanent crown. Some dentists can digitally scan the tooth and make the crown in their office. Sometimes, the impression is taken at a second visit instead of the initial visit.\n    *   Make and fit your tooth with a temporary crown.\n\n*   At the second visit, the dentist will:\n    *   Remove the temporary crown.\n    *   Fit your permanent crown. Your dentist may take an x-ray to make sure the crown fits well.\n    *   Cement the crown in place.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nA crown can be used to:\n\n*   Attach a bridge, which fills a gap created by missing teeth\n*   Repair a weak tooth and keep it from breaking\n*   Support and cover a tooth\n*   Replace a misshapen tooth or restore a dental implant\n*   Correct a misaligned tooth\n*   Improve the appearance of an existing tooth\n\nTalk to your dentist if you need a crown. You may need a crown because you have a:\n\n*   Large cavity with too little of the natural tooth left to hold a filling\n*   Chipped or broken tooth\n*   Worn down or cracked tooth from grinding your teeth\n*   Discolored or stained tooth\n*   Badly shaped tooth that does not match your other teeth\n\n**Risks**\n\nSeveral problems can occur with a crown:\n\n*   Your tooth under the crown can still get a cavity. To prevent cavities, be sure to brush your teeth twice a day and floss once a day.\n*   The crown could fall off. This can happen if the core of the tooth that holds the crown in place is too weak. If the nerve of the tooth is affected, you may need a root canal procedure to save the tooth. Or, you may need to have the tooth pulled and replaced with a dental implant.\n*   Your crown could chip or crack. If you grind your teeth or clench your jaw, you may need to wear a bite splint or mouth guard at night to protect your crown when you sleep.\n*   The nerve of your tooth could become extra sensitive to cold and hot temperatures. It may be painful. In this case, you may need a root canal procedure.\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nThere are several types of crowns, and each has pros and cons. Talk to your dentist about the type of crown that works best for you. There are different types of crowns.\n\n*   Stainless steel crowns:\n    *   Are pre-made.\n    *   Work well as temporary crowns, especially for young children. The crown falls out when the child loses the baby tooth.\n*   Metal crowns:\n    *   Hold up to chewing and teeth grinding\n    *   Rarely chip\n    *   Last the longest\n    *   Do not look natural in color\n*   Resin crowns:\n    *   Cost less than other crowns\n    *   Wear down more quickly and may need to be replaced sooner than other crowns\n    *   Are weaker and prone to cracking\n*   Ceramic or porcelain crowns:\n    *   Wear down opposing teeth more than metal crowns\n    *   Match the color of other teeth\n    *   May be a good choice if you have a metal allergy\n*   Porcelain fused to metal crowns:\n    *   Are made from porcelain covering a metal coping\n    *   The porcelain part is more prone to fracture than crowns made of all porcelain\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nWhile you have the temporary crown in place, you may need to:\n\n*   Slide your floss out, rather than lifting it up, which can pull the crown off the tooth.\n*   Avoid sticky foods, such as gummy bears, caramels, bagels, nutrition bars, and gum.\n\nContact your dentist if you:\n\n*   Have swelling that is getting worse.\n*   Feel that your bite is not right.\n*   Lose your temporary crown.\n*   Feel as if your tooth is out of place.\n*   Have pain in the tooth that is not relieved with over-the-counter pain medicine.\n\nOnce the permanent crown is in place:\n\n*   If your tooth still has its nerve, you may have some sensitivity to heat or cold. This should go away over time.\n*   Expect that it will take a few days to get used to the new crown in your mouth.\n*   Take care of your crown the same way you take care of your normal teeth.\n*   If you have a porcelain crown, you may want to avoid chewing on hard candy or ice to avoid chipping your crown.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWhen you have a crown, you should be more comfortable chewing, and it should look good.\n\nMost crowns should last at least 5 years and can last as long as 15 to 20 years.\n\n---\n\n**Dental Crowns**\n\nA dental crown is a tooth-shaped cap that replaces your normal tooth above the gum line.

    "content": "**Dental Plaque Identification at Home**\n\nPlaque is a soft and sticky substance that collects around and between teeth. The home dental plaque identification test shows where plaque builds up. This helps you know how well you are brushing and flossing your teeth.\n\n**What is Plaque?**\n\nPlaque is the major cause of tooth decay and gum disease (gingivitis). It is hard to see with the naked eye because it is whitish colored, like teeth.\n\n**How to Perform the Test**\n\nThere are two ways to perform this test:\n\n*   One method uses special tablets that contain a red dye that stains the plaque. You chew 1 tablet thoroughly, moving the mixture of saliva and dye over your teeth and gums for about 30 seconds. Then rinse your mouth with water and examine your teeth. Any red-stained areas are plaque. A small dental mirror may help you check all areas.\n*   The second method uses a plaque light. You swirl a special fluorescent solution around your mouth. Then rinse your mouth gently with water. Examine your teeth and gums while shining an ultraviolet plaque light into your mouth. The light will make any plaque look bright yellow-orange.\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\nBrush and floss your teeth thoroughly before performing the test.\n\n**How the Test Will Feel**\n\nYour mouth may feel slightly dried out after using the dye.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThe test helps identify missed plaque. It can encourage you to improve your brushing and flossing so that you remove more plaque from your teeth. Plaque that remains on your teeth can cause tooth decay or make your gums bleed easily and become red or swollen.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNo plaque or food debris will be seen on your teeth.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nThe tablets will stain areas of plaque dark red.\n\nThe plaque light solution will color the plaque a bright orange-yellow.\n\nThe colored areas show where brushing and flossing was not sufficient. These areas need to be brushed again to get rid of the stained plaque.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are no risks.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nThe tablets may cause a temporary pink coloring of your lips and cheeks. They may color your mouth and tongue red. Dentists suggest using them at night so that the color will be gone by morning.\n\n---\n\n**Dental Plaque Identification at Home**\n\n**What is Dental Plaque?**\n\nDental plaque is a sticky film of bacteria that forms on your teeth and can cause tooth decay and gum disease (gingivitis).

It's made up of food particles, saliva, and bacteria.\n\n**Why is dental plaque important?**\n\nIf you don't remove dental plaque regularly, it can lead to tooth decay and gum disease. In fact, the American Dental Association says that removing plaque daily can help prevent these problems.\n\n**How do I identify dental plaque at home?**\n\nLook for a sticky film on your teeth, especially in the areas where your teeth and gums meet. You can also check for signs of plaque by looking for:\n\n* **Yellow or brown stains** on your teeth\n* **Tartar buildup** around the gum line\n\n**What can I do to prevent dental plaque?**\n\nTo keep your teeth healthy, make sure to:\n\n* Brush your teeth at least twice a day with fluoride toothpaste\n* Floss once a day to remove food particles and plaque from between your teeth\n* Visit your dentist regularly for cleanings and check-ups\n\nBy following these steps, you can help prevent dental plaque and keep your smile healthy!",

    "content": "**Dental Sealants**\n\nDental sealants are a thin resin coating that dentists apply to the grooves of the permanent back teeth, the molars and premolars. Sealants are applied to help prevent cavities.\n\n**Why Sealants are Used**\n\nThe grooves on the top of molars and premolars are deep and can be hard to clean with a toothbrush. Bacteria can build up in the grooves and cause cavities.\n\nDental sealants can help:\n\n* Keep food, acids, and plaque from sitting in the grooves of the molars and premolars\n* Prevent decay and cavities\n* Save time, money, and the discomfort of getting a cavity filled\n\nChildren are most at risk for cavities on molars. Sealants can help protect permanent molars. Permanent molars come in when children are about 6 years old and then again when they are 12 years old. Getting sealants soon after the molars have come in will help protect them from cavities.\n\nAdults who do not have cavities or decay on their molars can also get sealants.\n\nSealants last about 5 to 10 years. Your dentist should check them at each visit in case a sealant needs to be replaced.\n\n**How Dental Sealants are Applied**\n\nYour dentist applies sealants on the molars in a few quick steps. There is no drilling or scraping of the molars. Your dentist will:\n\n* Clean the tops of the molars and premolars.\n* Put a conditioning acid gel on the top of the molar for a few seconds.\n* Rinse and dry the tooth surface.\n* Paint the sealant into the grooves of the tooth.\n* Shine a special light on the sealant to help it dry and harden. This takes about 10 to 30 seconds.\n\n**Cost and Insurance Coverage**\n\nAsk your dental office about the cost of dental sealants. The cost of dental sealants is usually priced per tooth.\n\nCheck with your insurance plan to see if the cost of sealants is covered. Many plans cover sealants.\nSome plans have limits on coverage. For example, sealants may be covered only up to a certain age.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nYou should contact the dentist if you:\n\n* Feel that your bite is not right\n* Lose your sealant\n* Notice any staining or discoloration around the sealant\n\n---\n\n**Dental Sealants**\n\n**What are dental sealants?**\n\nDental sealants, also known as pit and fissure sealants, are a type of protective coating applied to the molars and premolars to prevent decay and cavities.\n\n**Why do I need dental sealants?**\n\nYou should consider getting dental sealants if you:\n\n* Are at risk for cavities on your molars\n* Want to save time and money by preventing cavities\n* Don't want to go through the discomfort of getting a cavity filled\n\n**Who can get dental sealants?**\n\nChildren are most at risk for cavities on their molars, especially those who come in around 6 years old and again at 12 years old. Getting sealants soon after they come in will help protect them from cavities. Adults who don't have cavities or decay on their molars can also get sealants.\n\n**How long do dental sealants last?**\n\nDental sealants typically last about 5 to 10 years, and your dentist should check them at each visit to see if a new one needs to be applied.\n\n**How are dental sealants applied?**\n\nThe process is quick and painless:\n\n1. Your dentist will clean the tops of your molars and premolars.\n2. A conditioning acid gel will be applied for a few seconds.\n3. The tooth surface will be rinsed and dried.\n4. The sealant will be painted into the grooves of the tooth.\n5. A special light will be shone on the sealant to help it dry and harden.\n\n**Cost and Insurance Coverage**\n\nThe cost of dental sealants is usually priced per tooth, so be sure to ask your dentist about the cost. Check with your insurance plan to see if the cost of sealants is covered, as many plans do cover them. Some plans may have limits on coverage, such as only covering sealants up to a certain age.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nIf you experience any of the following, contact your dentist:\n\n* Your bite feels off\n* You lose your sealant\n* You notice staining or discoloration around the sealant\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nDental sealants are also known as pit and fissure sealants.",

    "content": "**Dental X-rays**\n\nDental x-rays are a type of image of the teeth and mouth. They use high energy electromagnetic radiation to form an image on film or screen.\n\n**How Dental X-Rays Work**\n\nStructures that are dense, such as silver fillings or metal restoration, will block most of the light energy from the x-ray, making them appear white in the image. Structures that contain air will be black, and teeth, tissue, and fluid will appear as shades of gray.\n\n**Types of Dental X-Rays**\n\nThere are many types of dental x-rays, including:\n\n*   **Bitewing**: Shows the crown portions of the top and bottom teeth together when the person bites on a biting tab.\n*   **Periapical**: Shows 1 or 2 complete teeth from crown to root.\n*   **Palatal (also called occlusal)**: Captures all the upper or lower teeth in one shot while the film rests on the biting surface of the teeth.\n*   **Panoramic**: Requires a special machine that rotates around the head. The x-ray captures all of the jaws and teeth in one shot.\n*   **Cephalometric**: Presents the side view of the face and represents relationship of the jaw to each other as well as to the rest of the structures.\n\n**Preparing for a Dental X-Ray**\n\nThere is no special preparation needed, but you should remove any metal objects in the area of the x-ray exposure. A lead apron may be placed over your body, and you should tell your dentist if you might be pregnant.\n\n**How a Dental X-Ray Will Feel**\n\nThe x-ray itself causes no discomfort, but biting on the piece of film can make some people gag. Slow, deep breathing through the nose usually relieves this feeling. Some types of dental x-rays do not require any biting pieces.\n\n**Why Dental X-Rays Are Performed**\n\nDental x-rays help diagnose disease and injury of the teeth and gums as well as help planning the appropriate treatment.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormal x-rays show a normal number, structure, and position of the teeth and jaw bones. There are no cavities or other problems.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nDental x-rays may be used to identify the following:\n\n*   The number, size, and position of teeth\n*   Partially or fully impacted teeth\n*   The presence and severity of tooth decay (called cavities or dental caries)\n*   Bone damage (such as from gum disease called periodontitis)\n*   Abscessed teeth\n*   Fractured jaw\n*   Problems in the way the upper and lower teeth fit together (malocclusion)\n*   Other abnormalities of the teeth and jaw bones\n\n---\n\n**Dental X-rays**\n\nDental x-rays are a type of image of the teeth and mouth. X-rays are a form of high energy electromagnetic radiation that penetrate the body to form an image on film or screen.\n\n**How Dental X-Rays Work**\n\nStructures that are dense, such as silver fillings or metal restoration, will block most of the light energy from the x-ray, making them appear white in the image. Structures that contain air will be black, and teeth, tissue, and fluid will appear as shades of gray.\n\n**Types of Dental X-Rays**\n\nThere are many types of dental x-rays, including:\n\n*   **Bitewing**: Shows the crown portions of the top and bottom teeth together when the person bites on a biting tab.\n*   **Periapical**: Shows 1 or 2 complete teeth from crown to root.\n*   **Palatal (also called occlusal)**: Captures all the upper or lower teeth in one shot while the film rests on the biting surface of the teeth.\n*   **Panoramic**: Requires a special machine that rotates around the head. The x-ray captures all of the jaws and teeth in one shot. It is used to plan treatment for dental implants, check for impacted wisdom teeth, and detect jaw problems.\n*   **Cephalometric**: Presents the side view of the face and represents relationship of the jaw to each other as well as to the rest of the structures.\n\n**Digital Dental X-Rays**\n\nMany dentists take x-rays using digital technology. These images run through a computer, reducing the amount of radiation given off during the procedure. Other types of dental x-rays can create a 3-D picture of the jaw. Cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT) may be used before dental surgery.\n\n**Preparing for a Dental X-Ray**\n\nThere is no special preparation needed for a dental x-ray. You should remove any metal objects in the area of the x-ray exposure and tell your dentist if you might be pregnant. A lead apron may be placed over your body to reduce radiation exposure.\n\n**What to Expect During a Dental X-Ray**\n\nThe x-ray itself causes no discomfort, but biting on the piece of film may make some people gag. Slow, deep breathing through the nose usually relieves this feeling. Both CBCT and cephalometric x-rays do not require any biting pieces.\n\n---\n\n**Dental X-rays**\n\n**What is a Dental X-ray?**\n\nA dental x-ray, also known as a radiograph, is an image of the teeth and jaw bones taken using low levels of radiation. There are several types of dental x-rays, including:\n\n* **Bitewings**: Taken from above the teeth to show the upper and lower teeth\n* **Periapical film**: Taken from below the teeth to show the entire tooth, including the roots\n* **Panoramic film**: A wide image that shows all the teeth on one side of the mouth\n* **Cephalometric x-ray**: A specialized x-ray used to evaluate the alignment and structure of the jaw bones\n\n**Why are Dental X-rays Performed?**\n\nDental x-rays help diagnose disease and injury of the teeth and gums, as well as plan appropriate treatment. They can reveal:\n\n* The number, size, and position of teeth\n* Partially or fully impacted teeth\n* The presence and severity of tooth decay (cavities or dental caries)\n* Bone damage (such as from gum disease called periodontitis)\n* Abscessed teeth\n* Fractured jaw\n* Problems in the way the upper and lower teeth fit together (malocclusion)\n\n**What are Normal Results?**\n\nNormal x-rays show a normal number, structure, and position of the teeth and jaw bones. There are no cavities or other problems.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is very low radiation exposure from dental x-rays. However, no one should receive more radiation than necessary. A lead apron can be used to cover the body and reduce radiation exposure. Pregnant women should not have x-rays taken unless necessary.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nDental x-rays can reveal dental cavities before they are clinically visible, even to the dentist. Many dentists will take yearly bitewings to look for early development of cavities in between the teeth.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nX-ray - teeth; Radiograph - dental; Bitewings; Periapical film; Panoramic film; Cephalometric x-ray; Digital image\n\n**References**\n\nDhar V.

    "content": "**Dentures**\n\nAlso called: False teeth\n\n**Summary**\n\nDentures are false teeth made to replace teeth you have lost. They can be complete or partial. Complete dentures cover your entire upper or lower jaw. Partials replace one or a few teeth.\n\n**Adjusting to Dentures**\n\nDentures may feel strange at first. Speaking and eating may feel different. Be careful when wearing dentures because they may make it harder for you to feel hot foods and liquids. Also, you may not notice biting on a bone from your food.\n\nIn the beginning, your dentist may want to see you often to make sure the dentures fit. Over time, your mouth will change and you may need to have your dentures adjusted or replaced. Be sure to let your dentist handle these adjustments.\n\n**Solutions for Denture Problems**\n\nIf your dentures move too much in your mouth, denture adhesive may help. In some cases, your dentist may suggest that you switch to dental implants. They are permanent, and they replace both the roots and teeth.\n\n**Caring for Your Dentures**\n\nKeep your dentures clean and free from food that can cause stains, bad breath, or swollen gums. Brush them every day with a denture care product.

Ask yourself:\n\n* Do you still feel depressed? Is the medicine not working?\n* What did you expect would change with this medicine?\n* Have you been taking this medicine long enough for it to work?\n\nIf you have side effects, write them down and discuss them with your provider.

Discuss each point with them.\n\nThen, ask your provider:\n\n* Do we agree on our treatment goals?\n* What are the benefits of staying on this medicine now?\n* What are the risks of stopping this medicine now?\n\nFind out whether there are other things you can do to address your reasons for stopping the medicine, such as:\n\n* Changing the dose of the medicine\n* Changing the time of day you take the medicine\n* Changing how you take the medicine in relation to food\n* Taking a different medicine instead\n* Treating any side effects\n* Adding another treatment, such as talk therapy\n\n**If You Decide to Stop the Medicine**\n\nMake sure you understand what you need to do to stop the medicine safely. Ask your provider how to lower the dose of this medicine over time. Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly.\n\nAs you reduce the amount of medicine you take, write down any symptoms you feel and when you feel them. Then discuss these with your provider.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nDepression or anxiety might not come back right away when you stop taking the medicine, but it may come back in the future. If you start to feel depressed or anxious again, contact your provider. You should also contact your provider if you have the withdrawal symptoms listed above. It is very important to get help if you have any thoughts of harming yourself or others.\n\nBy following these steps and having an open conversation with your healthcare provider, you can make an informed decision about whether to stop taking your antidepressant medication.\n\n---\n\n**Depression - Stopping Your Medicines**\n\n**Before You Stop Your Medicine**\n\nStopping your medicine may be the right choice for you, but first, you should talk with your health care provider.

    "content": "**Depression Myths & Facts Quiz**\n\nWhich of these may be a symptom of depression?\n\n* Feeling sad, worthless, or guilty\n* Fatigue\n* Loss of pleasure\n* Problems doing tasks at home or work\n* Change of sleep pattern\n* All of the above\n\nThe correct answer is all of the above. Depression may be described as feeling sad, blue, unhappy, or miserable. Most of us feel this way sometimes for short periods. But depression as a medical condition affects your daily life in an ongoing way.\n\n**Myth-Busting**\n\nDepression is a state of mind – if you try hard enough, you can snap out of it.\n\nThe correct answer is myth. Depression is a medical disorder that causes real suffering. Brain scans have shown that certain areas of the brain look different in people with depression. It's unclear what causes the disorder. An imbalance of brain chemicals or genetic factors may play a role.\n\nIf a friend or loved one talks about suicide, what should you do?\n\n* Don't be alarmed – suicide is rare\n* Seek professional help immediately\n* Check back tomorrow to see if the person is feeling better\n\nThe correct answer is seek professional help immediately. Suicide can be prevented with prompt intervention. If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org.\n\nDepression is more common in women.\n\nThe correct answer is fact. Hormonal changes throughout a woman’s life may play a role. At puberty, girls have twice the risk for depression than boys. Many women notice mood changes and even depression around their period, after childbirth, and around the time of menopause.\n\nPeople who are depressed tend to:\n\n* Eat more than usual\n* Eat less than usual\n* Either A or B\n\nThe correct answer is either A or B. While some people lose interest in food when they are depressed, others turn to food for comfort and overeat.\n\nChildren don't get depressed.\n\nThe correct answer is myth. A depressed child may complain of aches and pains, refuse to go to school, or worry all the time. About 10% to 15% of teenagers have symptoms of depression at some point in their teen years.\n\nMen may spend more time at work when they are depressed.\n\nThe correct answer is fact. Men often react to depression in different ways than women.\n\n---\n\n**Depression Myths & Facts Quiz**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Men and Depression**\n\nThey are more likely to work long hours, abuse alcohol or drugs, lose their temper, or behave recklessly.\n\nThe correct answer is fact. Men often react to depression in different ways than women. They are more likely to work long hours, abuse alcohol or drugs, lose their temper, or behave recklessly.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Effective Talk Therapies**\n\nWhich types of talk therapy are effective in treating depression?\n\nA. Support groups\nB. Psychotherapy\nC. Cognitive-behavioral therapy\nD. All of the above\n\nThe correct answer is all of the above. Cognitive-behavioral therapy teaches you how to fight negative thoughts and develop self-awareness and problem-solving skills. Psychotherapy can help you understand the issues behind your thoughts and feelings. Support groups can help you feel less alone.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Depression and Other Illnesses**\n\nDepression can make the symptoms of other illnesses seem worse.\n\nThe correct answer is fact. If you have a health condition like diabetes, heart disease, or many others, depression can make the symptoms more severe. Feeling sad or down also makes it harder for you to do the work needed to manage your illness. Getting help for depression usually makes it easier to successfully treat any medical condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Antidepressant Medicines**\n\nWhich of the following is true of antidepressant medicines?\n\nA. Antidepressants usually start working right away.\nB. Antidepressants are addictive.\nC. If one type of antidepressant doesn't help, chances are another one will.\nD. You will probably need to take antidepressants for the rest of your life.\n\nThe correct answer is if one type of antidepressant doesn't help, chances are another one will. Remember that it can take 4 to 12 weeks for an antidepressant to become fully effective, so try to be patient. However, some benefits start earlier than that. If your medicine isn’t helping, be sure to talk to your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Depression Treatment**\n\nDepression is very difficult to treat.\n\nThe correct answer is myth. In reality, most patients get better when treated with medicine, talk therapy, or both together. The first step is to talk to your doctor, who can treat you or refer you to a mental health professional.\n\n\\n\\n",

    "content": "**Depression in Older Adults**\n\nDepression is a mental health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It's a mood disorder characterized by feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration that last for at least two weeks and interfere with daily life.\n\n**Causes of Depression in Older Adults**\n\nLife changes can increase the risk of depression or make existing depression worse in older adults. Some common causes include:\n\n*   A move from home to a retirement facility\n*   Chronic illness or pain\n*   Children moving away\n*   Spouse or close friends passing away\n*   Loss of independence (e.g., problems with mobility, self-care, or driving privileges)\n\nDepression can also be related to physical illnesses such as:\n\n*   Thyroid disorders\n*   Parkinson disease\n*   Heart disease\n*   Cancer\n*   Stroke\n*   Dementia (e.g., Alzheimer's disease)\n\nOveruse of alcohol or certain medications (e.g., sleep aids) can worsen depression.\n\n**Symptoms of Depression in Older Adults**\n\nMany common symptoms of depression may be seen, but depression in older adults can be challenging to detect. Symptoms like fatigue, appetite loss, and trouble sleeping can be mistaken for the aging process or a physical illness. In severe cases, symptoms may resemble dementia.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA healthcare provider will perform a physical exam, ask about medical history and symptoms, and may order blood and urine tests to rule out underlying physical illnesses. A mental health specialist may be needed to help with diagnosis and treatment.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe first steps in treatment are:\n\n1.  Treat any underlying illness causing the symptoms.\n2.  Stop taking medications that may be exacerbating the symptoms.\n3.  Avoid alcohol and sleep aids.\n\nIf these steps don't help, medicines to treat depression and talk therapy often provide relief. Providers typically prescribe lower doses of antidepressants for older adults and increase the dose more slowly than for younger adults.\n\n**Managing Depression at Home**\n\nTo better manage depression at home:\n\n*   Exercise regularly (if recommended by your healthcare provider).\n*   Surround yourself with caring, positive people and engage in enjoyable activities.\n*   Practice good sleep habits.\n*   Recognize early signs of depression and know how to respond if they occur.\n*   Limit alcohol consumption and avoid illegal drugs.\n*   Share feelings with someone you trust.\n*   Take medications correctly and discuss any side effects with your healthcare provider.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nDepression often responds well to treatment, especially when individuals have access to social support, family, and friends who can help them stay active and engaged. However, the most concerning complication of depression is suicide, particularly among older men who live alone. If you or someone you know is struggling with depression or suicidal thoughts, please reach out to a healthcare provider or call 988 for immediate assistance.\n\n---\n\n**Depression in Older Adults**\n\nDepression is a widespread problem among older adults, often not recognized or treated. It's essential to understand the causes, symptoms, exams, tests, and treatments for depression in this age group.\n\n**Causes**\n\nLife changes can increase the risk of depression or make existing depression worse. Some of these changes include:\n\n*   A move from home, such as to a retirement facility\n*   Chronic illness or pain\n*   Children moving away\n*   Spouse or close friends passing away\n*   Loss of independence (e.g., problems getting around or caring for oneself, or loss of driving privileges)\n\nDepression can also be related to physical illnesses, such as:\n\n*   Thyroid disorders\n*   Parkinson disease\n*   Heart disease\n*   Cancer\n*   Stroke\n*   Dementia (such as Alzheimer disease)\n\nOveruse of alcohol or certain medicines (e.g., sleep aids) can make depression worse.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMany usual symptoms of depression may be seen, but depression in older adults can be hard to detect. Common symptoms like fatigue, appetite loss, and trouble sleeping can be part of the aging process or a physical illness. As a result, symptoms of early depression may be ignored or confused with other conditions common in older adults. In severe cases, symptoms may resemble dementia.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour healthcare provider will perform a physical exam, asking questions about your medical history and symptoms. Blood and urine tests may be done to look for a physical illness. A mental health specialist may be needed to help with diagnosis and treatment.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe first steps of treatment are:\n\n*   Exercise regularly (if your provider says it's okay)\n*   Surround yourself with caring, positive people and do fun activities\n*   Learn good sleep habits\n*   Watch for early signs of depression and know how to react if they occur\n*   Drink less alcohol and don't use illegal drugs\n*   Talk about your feelings with someone you trust\n*   Take medicines correctly and discuss any side effects with your provider\n\nDepression often responds to treatment, and the outcome is usually better for people who have access to social services, family, and friends who can help them stay active and engaged.\n\n---\n\n**Depression in Older Adults**\n\n**What is Depression?**\n\nDepression is a mood disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities.\n\n**Causes of Depression in Older Adults**\n\nDepression in older adults can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n*   **Physical Illness**: Blood and urine tests may be done to look for a physical illness.\n*   **Social Isolation**: Lack of social interaction and support from family and friends.\n*   **Chronic Pain**: Persistent pain from conditions such as arthritis or back problems.\n*   **Sleep Disturbances**: Difficulty sleeping or insomnia.\n\n**Symptoms of Depression in Older Adults**\n\nThe symptoms of depression in older adults may include:\n\n*   **Persistent Sadness**: Feeling sad, hopeless, and helpless most of the day.\n*   **Loss of Interest**: Losing interest in activities that were once enjoyed.\n*   **Changes in Appetite**: Decreased or increased appetite.\n*   **Weight Changes**: Weight gain or loss.\n*   **Fatigue**: Feeling tired and lacking energy.\n\n**Diagnosing Depression in Older Adults**\n\nTo diagnose depression in older adults, healthcare providers may use various tools, including:\n\n*   **Screening Tools**: Questionnaires and assessments to identify symptoms of depression.\n*   **Physical Examination**: A thorough physical examination to rule out underlying medical conditions.\n*   **Laboratory Tests**: Blood and urine tests to look for a physical illness.\n\n**Treatment of Depression in Older Adults**\n\nThe treatment of depression in older adults may involve:\n\n*   **Medications**: Antidepressant medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to help manage symptoms.\n*   **Talk Therapy**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and other forms of talk therapy to help individuals cope with depression.\n*   **Lifestyle Changes**: Regular exercise, healthy eating, and sufficient sleep to improve overall well-being.\n\n**Preventing Suicide in Older Adults**\n\nSuicide is a significant concern among older adults with depression. To prevent suicide, families and caregivers should:\n\n*   **Monitor for Warning Signs**: Watch for signs of suicidal ideation, such as talking about death or wanting to die.\n*   **Encourage Help-Seeking Behavior**: Support individuals in seeking professional help when needed.\n*   **Provide Emotional Support**: Offer emotional support and understanding to individuals struggling with depression.\n\n**When to Seek Medical Attention**\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of depression, it is essential to seek medical attention. Contact a healthcare provider if:\n\n*   **Persistent Sadness**: Feeling sad, hopeless, and helpless most of the day.\n*   **Loss of Interest**: Losing interest in activities that were once enjoyed.\n*   **Changes in Appetite**: Decreased or increased appetite.\n*   **Weight Changes**: Weight gain or loss.\n*   **Fatigue**: Feeling tired and lacking energy.\n\nDon't delay seeking help. Contact a healthcare provider today to discuss your concerns and develop a plan to manage depression.\n\n---\n\n**Depression in Older Adults**\n\n\\n\\n**Persistent Depressive Disorder**\n\nAccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR), persistent depressive disorder is a type of depression that lasts for two years or more.

    "content": "**Depression**\n\nAlso called: Clinical depression, Dysthymic disorder, Major depressive disorder, Unipolar depression\n\n**Basics**\n\nDepression is more than a feeling of being sad or irritable for a few days. It's a serious mood disorder that can affect how you think, feel, and your everyday life.\n\n**What is Depression?**\n\nDepression is a condition where you may not know why you feel this way, but even basic daily activities such as sleeping, eating, or working may become difficult. Depression often needs long-term treatment, but getting help at the earliest sign of a problem can help manage your symptoms.\n\n**Types of Depression**\n\nThe most common types of depression are:\n\n*   Major depression: Symptoms include a depressed mood or a loss of interest. Symptoms affect your daily activities and last for at least two weeks.\n*   Persistent depressive disorder (also called dysthymia or dysthymic disorder): Has less severe depressive symptoms, but they last longer, usually for at least two years.\n\nOther types of depression can include:\n\n*   Seasonal affective disorder: Comes and goes with the seasons. It usually starts in late fall and early winter and goes away during the spring and summer.\n*   Bipolar disorder: Sometimes called manic depression. This mood disorder can cause intense mood swings.\n*   Depression with symptoms of psychosis: A severe form of depression that also has delusions (false beliefs) or hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling something that isn't there).\n\n**Causes of Depression**\n\nThere are a variety of things that may cause depression, including genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Depression can happen at any age and can affect anyone, but it's more common in women. This is often due to the physical and hormonal changes that women have during menstruation, pregnancy, the postpartum period, and menopause.\n\n**Who is at Risk of Depression?**\n\nYou may be at a higher risk of depression if you have a close relative who has it or another mental health disorder. Going through trauma or stressful life events may raise your risk even more.\n\n**Symptoms of Depression**\n\nDepression doesn't look the same on everyone. The type and number of symptoms of depression can vary and don't always appear like sadness. Symptoms of depression are ongoing and affect your day-to-day life. They can include:\n\n*   Feeling sad or \"empty\"\n*   Losing interest in favorite activities\n*   Overeating, or not wanting to eat at all\n*   Sleeping too much, or not enough\n*   Feeling very tired\n*   Feeling hopeless, irritable, anxious, or guilty\n*   Having aches and pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems\n*   Having thoughts of death or suicide\n*   Changing moods or behaviors\n*   Increasing use of alcohol or drugs\n*   Isolating from family and friends\n\n**How is Depression Diagnosed?**\n\nIf you think you have depression, talk to your health care provider or a mental health provider. To be diagnosed with depression, your provider may use many tools:\n\n*   A medical history will include asking about your symptoms and family history.\n*   Medical tests may be done to rule out other medical conditions.\n*   A physical exam to make sure another issue isn't causing your symptoms.\n*   A mental health evaluation by your provider or a mental health provider.\n\n**What are the Treatments for Depression?**\n\nDepression may need long-term treatment. Most treatments include medicines and/or psychotherapy (talk therapy):\n\n*   Medicines such as antidepressants may help control your symptoms. You may need to try several medicines to find which works best for you.\n*   Psychotherapy (talk therapy) under the care of a mental health provider can help you recognize and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors.\n\nOther treatments options may be considered if treatment isn't working or if depression is severe. These may include:\n\n*   Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): A brain stimulation procedure that uses a mild electric current when you are under general anesthesia.\n*   Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS): A brain stimulation procedure that uses magnetic waves to relieve depression.\n\n**Can Depression be Prevented?**\n\nMost cases of depression can't be prevented, but healthy lifestyle changes can have long-term benefits for your mental health. These can include:\n\n*   Getting regular exercise\n*   Having a consistent sleep schedule\n*   Controlling stress\n\nIf you, or someone you love is depressed, see your provider or a mental health provider. It's important to get treatment at the earliest sign of a problem.\n\nIf you or someone you know has thoughts of hurting themselves or attempting suicide, get help right away. If it is an emergency, dial 911.\n\n---\n\n**Depression**\n\nDepression is more than a feeling of being sad or irritable for a few days. It's a serious mood disorder.

    "content": "**Depression**\n\nDepression is a psychiatric disorder that affects mood, behavior, and overall health. It causes prolonged feelings of sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness, and a loss of interest in activities that were once enjoyed.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPeople with depression may also have changes in appetite (leading to overeating or not eating enough), changes in sleeping patterns (sleeping too much or not being able to sleep), loss of energy, and difficulty concentrating. Although depression is considered primarily a mental health disorder, it can also have physical features including headaches, other unexplained aches and pains, unusually slow or fast movements, and digestive problems.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nTo be diagnosed with depression, an individual must have signs and symptoms nearly every day for at least 2 weeks. However, the features of this condition vary widely.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nDepression most commonly begins in late adolescence or early adulthood, although it can appear at any age. If untreated, episodes of depression can last for weeks, months, or years, and can go away and come back (recur). Affected individuals may have difficulty functioning in their daily lives, including at school or work.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nPeople with depression have a higher risk of substance abuse problems and dying by suicide than the general population.\n\n**Related Conditions**\n\nSeveral health conditions are closely related to depression or have depression as a characteristic feature. These include:\n\n* Dysthymia (which has long-lasting signs and symptoms that are similar to, but not as severe as, those of depression)\n* Perinatal or postpartum depression (which occurs around or following the birth of a child)\n* Seasonal affective disorder (which is triggered by the changing of the seasons)\n* Bipolar disorder (which can include both \"highs,\" or manic episodes, and depressive episodes)\n* Generalized anxiety disorder\n* Schizoaffective disorder (where depression or another mood disorder occurs together with features of schizophrenia)\n\n---\n\n**Depression**\n\nDepression is a psychiatric disorder that affects mood, behavior, and overall health. It causes prolonged feelings of sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness, and a loss of interest in activities that were once enjoyed.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPeople with depression may also have changes in appetite (leading to overeating or not eating enough), changes in sleeping patterns (sleeping too much or not being able to sleep), loss of energy, and difficulty concentrating. Although depression is considered primarily a mental health disorder, it can also have physical features including headaches, other unexplained aches and pains, unusually slow or fast movements, and digestive problems.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nTo be diagnosed with depression, an individual must have signs and symptoms nearly every day for at least 2 weeks. However, the features of this condition vary widely.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nDepression is one of the most common mental health disorders in the United States. More than 19 million American adolescents and adults are affected. In 2016, 6.7 percent of adults and 12.8 percent of adolescents reported having at least one episode of depression. Depression is about twice as common in women as in men, which may be related in part to hormonal factors.\n\n**Causes**\n\nDepression is known to run in families, suggesting that genetic factors contribute to the risk of developing this disease. However, research into the genetics of depression is in its early stages, and very little is known for certain about the genetic basis of the disease. Studies suggest that variations in many genes, each with a small effect, combine to increase the risk of developing depression.\n\nDetermining the genetic risk factors for depression is challenging for several reasons. It is possible that what is currently considered to be a single disease called \"depression\" is actually multiple disorders with similar signs and symptoms; these disorders could have different genetic risk factors. The genetic variations related to depression may also be somewhat different between men and women.\n\nResearchers suspect that studies with many more people will be required to pinpoint the genetic variations that influence the risk of depression. The genes thought to be associated with depression have diverse functions in the brain, including controlling the production (synthesis), transport, and activity of chemicals called neurotransmitters, which relay chemical signals that allow nerve cells (neurons) to communicate with one another.\n\nNongenetic (environmental) factors also play critical roles in a person's risk of developing depression. The disorder can be triggered by substance abuse, certain medications, or stressful life events (such as divorce or the death of a loved one). Other risk factors include difficulties in relationships or social isolation, unemployment, financial problems, and childhood abuse or neglect.\n\nSome physical illnesses, such as cancer, thyroid disease, and chronic pain, are also associated with an increased risk of developing depression. It is likely that environmental conditions interact with genetic factors to determine the overall risk of developing this disease.\n\n---\n\n**Depression: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 3/5)**\n\n**What is Depression?**\n\nDepression is a complex disease that affects millions of people worldwide. While its exact causes are still not fully understood, research suggests that both genetic and environmental factors play critical roles in determining an individual's risk of developing the condition.\n\n**Genetic Factors**\n\nStudies have shown that depression can run in families, indicating that genetic factors contribute to the risk of developing this disease. However, very little is known for certain about the genetic basis of depression.

People who have a first-degree relative (for example, a parent or sibling) with depression appear to have a two to three times greater risk of developing the condition than the general public. However, many people who develop depression do not have a family history of the disorder, and many people with an affected relative never develop the disorder.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nClinical depression, depressive disorder, major depression, major depressive disorder, MDD, and unipolar depression are all other names for this condition.\n\n---\n\n**Depression: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 4/5)**\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   **MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; MDD**\n*   **MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER 1**\n*   **MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER 2**\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   **Genetic effects influencing risk for major depressive disorder in China and Europe.** Transl Psychiatry. 2017 Mar 28;7(3):e1074.\n*   **Genetic determinants of depression: recent findings and future directions.** Harv Rev Psychiatry. 2015 Jan-Feb;23(1):1-18.\n*   **The genetics of major depression.** Neuron. 2014 Feb 5;81(3):484-503.\n*   **Overview of the genetics of major depressive disorder.** Curr Psychiatry Rep. 2010 Dec;12(6):539-46.\n*   **Genetics of Depression: Progress at Last.** Curr Psychiatry Rep. 2017 Aug;19(8):43.\n*   **Molecular and genetic basis of depression.** J Genet. 2014 Dec;93(3):879-92.\n*   **Genetic epidemiology of major depression: review and meta-analysis.** Am J Psychiatry. 2000 Oct;157(10):1552-62.\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n**References**\n\nExpand Section\nReferences\n\nExpand Section\nReferences\n\n---\n\n**Depression: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 5/5)**\n\n\\n\\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n*   What is the prognosis of a genetic condition?\n*   How can gene variants affect health and development?\n*   What does it mean if a disorder seems to run in my family?\n*   What are the different ways a genetic condition can be inherited?\n*   How are genetic conditions treated or managed?\n\n\\n\\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   Antidepressants\n*   Depression\n*   Genetic Disorders\n\n\\n\\n**MEDICAL ENCYCLOPEDIA**\n\n*   Dysthymia\n*   Genetics\n*   Major depression\n\n\\n\\n**Related Medical Tests**\n\n*   Depression Screening\n*   Suicide Risk Screening",

    "content": "**Depression**\n\nDepression can be described as feeling sad, blue, unhappy, miserable, or down in the dumps. Most of us feel this way at one time or another for short periods.\n\n**Clinical Depression**\n\nClinical depression is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for 2 weeks or more.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nDepression can occur in people of all ages:\n\n*   Adults\n*   Teenagers\n*   Older adults\n\n**Symptoms of Depression**\n\nSymptoms of depression include:\n\n*   Agitation, restlessness, irritability, and anger\n*   Becoming withdrawn or isolated\n*   Fatigue and lack of energy\n*   Feeling hopeless, helpless, worthless, guilty, and self-hate\n*   Loss of interest or pleasure in activities that were once enjoyed including sex\n*   Sudden change in appetite, often with weight gain or loss\n*   Thoughts of death or suicide\n*   Trouble concentrating\n*   Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much\n\n**Remember**\n\nRemember that children may have different symptoms than adults. Watch for changes in schoolwork, sleep, and behavior. If you wonder whether your child might be depressed, talk with your health care provider. Your provider can help you learn how to help your child with depression.\n\n**Main Types of Depression**\n\nThe main types of depression include:\n\n*   **Major depression**: It occurs when feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with daily life for 2 weeks or longer periods of time.\n*   **Persistent depressive disorder**: This is a depressed mood that lasts 2 years. Over that length of time, you may have periods of major depression, with times when your symptoms are milder.\n\n**Other Common Forms of Depression**\n\nOther common forms of depression include:\n\n*   **Postpartum depression**: Many women feel somewhat down after having a baby. However, true postpartum depression is more severe and includes the symptoms of major depression.\n*   **Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)**: Symptoms of depression occur 1 week before your period and disappear after you menstruate.\n*   **Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)**: This occurs most often during fall and winter, and disappears during spring and summer. It is most likely due to a lack of sunlight.\n*   **Major depression with psychotic features**: This occurs when a person has depression and loss of touch with reality (psychosis).\n*   **Bipolar disorder (formerly called manic depression)**: This occurs when depression alternates with mania. Bipolar disorder has depression as one of its symptoms, but it is a different type of mental illness.\n\n**Causes**\n\nDepression often runs in families. This may be due to your genes, behaviors you learn at home, or your environment. Depression may be triggered by stressful or unhappy life events. Often, it is a combination of these things.\n\nMany factors can bring on depression, including:\n\n*   **Alcohol or drug use**\n*   **Medical conditions**, such as cancer or long-term (chronic) pain\n*   **Stressful life events**, such as job loss, divorce, or death of a spouse or other family member\n*   **Social isolation** (a common cause of depression in older adults)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n*   You hear voices that are not there.\n*   You cry often without cause.\n*   Your depression has affected your work, school, or family life for longer than 2 weeks.\n*   You have three or more symptoms of depression.\n*   You think one of your current medicines may be making you feel depressed.

    "content": "**Dermabrasion**\n\nDermabrasion is a type of skin-smoothing surgery that removes the top layers of the skin.\n\n**Description**\n\nDermabrasion is usually performed by a doctor, either a plastic surgeon or dermatologic surgeon, in their office or an outpatient clinic. You'll likely be awake during the procedure, and a numbing medicine (local anesthesia) will be applied to the skin being treated. If you're having a complex procedure, you may be given sedatives to make you sleepy and less anxious, or general anesthesia, which allows you to sleep through surgery.\n\nDermabrasion uses a special device to gently \"sand down\" the top surface of the skin to normal, healthy skin. Petroleum jelly or antibiotic ointment is applied to the treated skin to prevent scabs and scars from forming.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nDermabrasion may be helpful if you have:\n\n* Age-related skin growths\n* Fine lines and wrinkles, such as around the mouth\n* Precancerous growths\n* Scars on the face due to acne, accidents, or previous surgery\n* Sun damage and photo-aging\n\nFor many of these conditions, other treatments can be done, such as laser or chemical peels, or medicine injected into the skin. Talk to your health care provider about treatment options for your skin problem.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks of any anesthesia and surgery in general include:\n\n* Reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots, infection\n\nRisks of dermabrasion include:\n\n* Lasting skin color changes with the skin staying lighter, darker, or pinker\n* Scars\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nAfter the procedure:\n\n* Your skin will be red and swollen. Swelling usually goes away within 2 to 3 weeks.\n* You may feel aching, tingling, or burning for a while. Your doctor can prescribe medicine to help control pain.\n* If you've had cold sores (herpes) before, your doctor may give you antiviral medicine to prevent an outbreak.\n\nDuring healing:\n\n* The new layer of skin will be swollen, sensitive, itchy, and bright pink for several weeks.\n* Healing time depends on the extent of dermabrasion and size of treatment area.\n* Most people can go back to normal activities in about 2 weeks. You should avoid any activity that could cause injury to the treated area. Avoid sports that involve balls, such as baseball, for 4 to 6 weeks.\n* For about 3 weeks after surgery, your skin will turn red when you drink alcohol.\n* Men who have this procedure may need to avoid shaving for a while and use an electric razor when shaving again.\n\nProtect your skin from the sun for 6 to 12 weeks or until your skin color has returned to normal. You can wear hypoallergenic make-up to hide any changes in skin color. New skin should closely match the surrounding skin when full color returns.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nIf your skin remains red and swollen after healing has started, it may be a sign that abnormal scars are forming.

    "content": "**Dermatomyositis**\n\n_Disease Overview_\n\nDermatomyositis is a disease that involves muscle inflammation and a skin rash. Polymyositis is a similar inflammatory condition that also involves muscle weakness, swelling, tenderness, and tissue damage but no skin rash. Both are part of a larger group of diseases called myopathies, more specifically inflammatory myopathies.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of dermatomyositis is unknown. Experts think it may be due to a viral infection of the muscles or a problem with the body's immune system. It may also occur in people who have cancer in the abdomen, lung, or other parts of the body.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\n* Muscle weakness, stiffness, or soreness\n* Problems swallowing\n* Purple color to the upper eyelids\n* Purple-red skin rash\n* Shortness of breath\n* Difficulty swallowing\n\nThe muscle weakness may come on suddenly or develop slowly over weeks or months. You may have trouble raising your arms over your head, getting up from a sitting position, and climbing stairs.\n\nThe rash may appear on your face, knuckles, neck, shoulders, upper chest, and back.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will do a physical exam. Tests may include:\n\n* Bloods test to check levels of muscle enzymes called creatine phosphokinase and aldolase\n* Blood tests for autoimmune diseases\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* Electromyography (EMG)\n* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n* Muscle biopsy\n* Skin biopsy\n* Screening tests for cancer\n* Chest x-ray and CT scan of the chest\n* Lung function tests\n* Swallowing study\n* Myositis specific and associated autoantibodies\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe main treatment is the use of corticosteroid medicines. The dose of medicine is slowly tapered off as muscle strength improves. This takes about 4 to 6 weeks. You may stay on a low dose of a corticosteroid medicine after that.\n\nMedicines to suppress the immune system may be used to replace the corticosteroids. These drugs may include azathioprine, methotrexate or mycophenolate.\n\nTreatments that may be tried when disease that remains active in spite of these medicines are:\n\n* Intravenous gamma globulin\n* Biologic drugs\n\nWhen your muscles get stronger, your provider may tell you to slowly cut back on your doses. Many people with this condition must take a medicine called prednisone for the rest of their lives.\n\nIf a tumor is causing the condition, the muscle weakness and rash may get better when the tumor is removed.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nIt is important to be followed by a health care provider when you have dermatomyositis. Severe illness can lead to disability and can sometimes result in death.\n\nSymptoms may go away completely in some people, such as children.\n\nThe condition may be fatal in adults due to:\n\n* Severe muscle weakness\n* Malnutrition\n* Pneumonia\n* Lung failure\n\n---\n\n**Dermatomyositis**\n\n_Disease Overview_\n\nDermatomyositis is a disease that involves muscle inflammation and a skin rash.

It affects women more often than men.\n\n_Symptoms_\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\n* Muscle weakness, stiffness, or soreness\n* Problems swallowing\n* Purple color to the upper eyelids\n* Purple-red skin rash\n* Shortness of breath\n* Difficulty swallowing\n\nThe muscle weakness may come on suddenly or develop slowly over weeks or months. You may have trouble raising your arms over your head, getting up from a sitting position, and climbing stairs.\n\n_Exams and Tests_\n\nThe health care provider will do a physical exam. Tests may include:\n\n* Bloods test to check levels of muscle enzymes called creatine phosphokinase and aldolase\n* Blood tests for autoimmune diseases\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* Electromyography (EMG)\n* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n* Muscle biopsy\n* Skin biopsy\n* Screening tests for cancer\n* Chest x-ray and CT scan of the chest\n* Lung function tests\n* Swallowing study\n* Myositis specific and associated autoantibodies\n\n_Treatment_\n\nThe main treatment is the use of corticosteroid medicines. The dose of medicine is slowly tapered off as muscle strength improves. This takes about 4 to 6 weeks. You may stay on a low dose of a corticosteroid medicine after that.\n\nMedicines to suppress the immune system may be used to replace the corticosteroids. These drugs may include azathioprine, methotrexate or mycophenolate.\n\nTreatments that may be tried when disease that remains active in spite of these medicines are:\n\n* Intravenous gamma globulin\n* Biologic drugs\n\nWhen your muscles get stronger, your provider may tell you to slowly cut back on your doses. Many people with this condition must take a medicine called prednisone for the rest of their lives.\n\nIf a tumor is causing the condition, the muscle weakness and rash may get better when the tumor is removed.\n\n---\n\n**Dermatomyositis**\n\n\\n\\nWhen your muscles get stronger, your provider may tell you to slowly cut back on your doses.

It is characterized by muscle weakness, skin rashes, and inflammation of the affected areas.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of dermatomyositis is unknown, but it is believed to be an autoimmune disorder. Certain genetic factors may also play a role in the development of the disease.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of dermatomyositis can vary from person to person, but common signs include:\n\n* Muscle weakness and fatigue\n* Skin rashes, particularly on the hands, feet, and face\n* Inflammation of the affected areas\n* Joint pain and stiffness\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing dermatomyositis typically involves a combination of physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. A muscle biopsy may also be performed to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for dermatomyositis usually involves a combination of medications, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. Physical therapy may also be recommended to improve muscle strength and function.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with dermatomyositis varies depending on the severity of the disease and the effectiveness of treatment. In some cases, the condition can be chronic and require ongoing management.\n\n**Related Topics**\n\n* Myositis\n* Dermatomyositis images\n\nNote: The cleaned output is a rewritten version of the original content, formatted to be more readable and concise.
