    "content": "**ATP8B1 Gene**\n\nThe **ATP8B1 gene**, also known as **FIC1**, provides instructions for making a protein that is found throughout the body. It is thought to control the distribution of certain fat molecules known as aminophospholipids on the inner surface of liver cell membranes. Based on this role, the ATP8B1 protein is sometimes known as an aminophospholipid translocase.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe ATP8B1 gene plays a critical role in maintaining an appropriate balance of bile acids, which is essential for the normal secretion of bile and the proper functioning of liver cells. The protein performs its function in the membranes of liver cells that transport fat-digesting acids called bile acids into bile.\n\n* **Normal Function**\n\t+ The ATP8B1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found throughout the body.\n\t+ It controls the distribution of certain fat molecules known as aminophospholipids on the inner surface of liver cell membranes.\n\t+ The ATP8B1 protein performs its function in the membranes of liver cells that transport bile acids into bile.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nMutations in the **ATP8B1 gene** can cause two health conditions:\n\n* **Benign Recurrent Intrahepatic Cholestasis (BRIC1)**: Mutations in the ATP8B1 gene can cause benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (BRIC1). People with BRIC1 have occasional episodes of impaired bile secretion that lead to severe itching (pruritus), and yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice).\n* **Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC1)**: More than 50 mutations in the ATP8B1 gene have been found to cause a severe form of liver disease called progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (PFIC1).\n\n---\n\n**ATP8B1 Gene**\n\nThe ATP8B1 gene is responsible for encoding a protein that plays a crucial role in the transport of bile acids across the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. Mutations in this gene can lead to two distinct conditions: benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (BRIC1) and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (PFIC1).\n\n**Benign Recurrent Intrahepatic Cholestasis Type 1 (BRIC1)**\n\nBRIC1 is a relatively mild condition characterized by occasional episodes of impaired bile secretion, leading to severe itching (pruritus) and yellowing of the skin and whites of the eye (jaundice). The exact mechanisms behind BRIC1 are unclear, but it's believed that mutations in the ATP8B1 gene result in the buildup of bile acids in liver cells.\n\n**Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis Type 1 (PFIC1)**\n\nPFIC1 is a severe form of liver disease caused by more than 50 mutations in the ATP8B1 gene. These mutations often remove large portions of the gene or lead to an abnormally short protein, severely altering its structure and function. As a result, bile acids build up in liver cells, causing damage and leading to symptoms such as short stature, deafness, diarrhea, and other signs of liver disease.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\nThe ATP8B1 gene is also known by the following names:\n\n* AT8B1_HUMAN\n* ATPase, aminophospholipid transporter, class I, type 8B, member 1\n* BRIC\n* FIC1\n* PFIC\n* PFIC1\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor further information and resources on the ATP8B1 gene, you can explore the following:\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry: Tests of ATP8B1\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed: PubMed\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: ATPase, CLASS I, TYPE 8B, MEMBER 1; ATP8B1\n* Gene and Variant Databases: NCBI Gene, ClinVar\n\n**References**\n\nThe following scientific articles provide additional insights into the ATP8B1 gene:\n\n* Cai SY, Gautam S, Nguyen T, Soroka CJ, Rahner C, Boyer JL.

These changes, which are not inherited, are called somatic mutations. Somatic mutations of the ATRX gene have been found in some people with blood and bone marrow disorders. In particular, researchers have found somatic ATRX gene mutations in some cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which is a bone marrow disorder that usually occurs in older males.\n\nSomatic ATRX gene mutations do not cause MDS; instead, they occur as the condition progresses. Like inherited mutations in the ATRX gene, somatic mutations reduce the activity of the HBA1 and HBA2 genes and cause alpha thalassemia. When alpha thalassemia occurs in people with MDS, the combination of disorders is often referred to as alpha thalassemia myelodysplastic syndrome (ATMDS).\n\n**Alpha Thalassemia X-Linked Intellectual Disability Syndrome**\n\nMore than 125 mutations in the ATRX gene have been identified in people with alpha thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome. The most common mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ATRX protein. Other mutations insert or delete genetic material in the ATRX gene or alter how the gene's instructions are used to make the protein.\n\nMutations may destabilize the ATRX protein or affect its interactions with other proteins. These changes prevent the ATRX protein from effectively regulating gene expression. Reduced activity of the HBA1 and HBA2 genes causes a blood disorder called alpha thalassemia.

    "content": "**AURKC Gene**\n\nThe AURKC gene provides instructions for making a protein called aurora kinase C. This protein regulates certain events during cell division.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nCell division occurs when a cell replicates and splits its contents, separating into two new cells. Aurora kinase C helps the two dividing cells separate from each other and ensures that these cells each contain a complete set of chromosomes. Aurora kinase C is most abundant in male testes, which are the male reproductive organs in which sperm are produced and stored.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Macrozoospermia**: At least four mutations in the AURKC gene have been found to cause macrozoospermia. This condition causes males to have abnormal sperm, which leads to an inability to father biological children (infertility). AURKC gene mutations that cause macrozoospermia lead to the production of a nonfunctional protein or a protein that is quickly broken down.\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: References section remains unchanged as it does not contain any medical information)\n\n---\n\n**AURKC Gene**\n\nThe AURKC gene is responsible for producing the aurora kinase C protein, which plays a crucial role in cell division. A mutation in this gene can lead to macrozoospermia, a condition characterized by an abnormal increase in sperm cell size.\n\n**Causes of Macrozoospermia**\n\nOne frequent cause of macrozoospermia in men of North African descent is a deletion of a single DNA building block (nucleotide) from the AURKC gene, resulting in a mutation known as 144delC. This mutation leads to the production of an abnormally short and nonfunctional aurora kinase C protein.\n\n**Effects on Sperm Cells**\n\nThe lack of aurora kinase C blocks cell division in sperm cells, causing them to have extra chromosomes, typically four copies of each instead of the usual one. As a result, sperm cells become enlarged, leading to multiple tails (flagella). If an abnormal sperm cell combines with an egg cell, the embryo may not develop or the pregnancy will likely end in miscarriage.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* AIK3\n* AIK3 protein kinase\n* ARK-3\n* ARK3\n* AurC\n* Aurora-related kinase 3\n* Aurora/IPL1-like kinase 3\n* Aurora/IPL1-related kinase 3\n* Serine-threonine-protein kinase 13\n* Serine/threonine-protein kinase aurora-C\n* STK13\n\n**References**\n\n* Ben Khelifa M, Coutton C, Blum MG, et al.

    "content": "**AVP Gene**\n\nThe AVP gene provides instructions for making a hormone called arginine vasopressin (AVP), which is sometimes also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH). AVP starts out as a larger molecule called a preprohormone that is cut (cleaved) and modified to produce the active hormone and several related proteins. The preprohormone is made in a region of the brain called the hypothalamus. It is then transported to the nearby pituitary gland, where active AVP is stored until it is needed.\n\nThe major function of AVP is to help control the body's water balance by determining how much water is released in urine. Normally, when a person's fluid intake is low or when a lot of fluid is lost (for example, through sweating), the pituitary gland releases more AVP into the bloodstream. High levels of this hormone direct the kidneys to reabsorb more water and make less urine. When fluid intake is adequate, the pituitary gland releases less AVP.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nMany variants (also called mutations) in the AVP gene have been found to cause arginine vasopressin deficiency. People with this condition produce an excessive amount of urine (polyuria), which depletes the amount of water in the body. This water loss also leads to excessive thirst (polydipsia). Some of the AVP gene variants that cause arginine vasopressin deficiency change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the preprohormone. Other variants cause the cell to produce an abnormally short version of this molecule. The altered preprohormone becomes trapped inside the cells where it is produced instead of being transported to the pituitary gland.\n\nThe resulting shortage of AVP prevents the kidneys from reabsorbing water, and the body makes excessive amounts of urine. These problems with water balance are characteristic of arginine vasopressin deficiency.\n\n---\n\n**AVP Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Many Variants in the AVP Gene Cause Arginine Vasopressin Deficiency**\n\nPeople with arginine vasopressin deficiency produce an excessive amount of urine, which depletes the body's water supply.

    "content": "**AVPR2 Gene**\n\nThe AVPR2 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as the vasopressin V2 receptor. This receptor works together with a hormone called arginine vasopressin (AVP), which is sometimes also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The vasopressin V2 receptor is found in the kidneys in structures called collecting ducts, which are a series of small tubes that reabsorb water from the kidneys into the bloodstream.\n\nThe interaction between AVP and the vasopressin V2 receptor triggers chemical reactions that control the body's water balance. When a person's fluid intake is low or when a lot of fluid is lost (for example, through sweating), AVP is released from the brain, where it is produced and stored. In the kidneys, this hormone attaches (binds) to the vasopressin V2 receptor and directs the kidneys to concentrate urine by reabsorbing some of the water back into the bloodstream. When fluid intake is adequate, the brain releases less AVP. At these times, less water is reabsorbed into the bloodstream and the urine is more dilute.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   Hundreds of variants (also called mutations) in the AVPR2 gene have been identified in people with arginine vasopressin resistance.\n*   People with this condition produce an excessive amount of urine (polyuria), which depletes the amount of water in the body.

It mainly affects males, although females may have mild features of the syndrome.\n\n**Physical Characteristics**\n\nPeople with Aarskog-Scott syndrome often have distinctive facial features, such as:\n\n* Widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism)\n* Small nose\n* Long area between the nose and mouth (philtrum)\n* Widow's peak hairline\n\nThey frequently have mild to moderate short stature during childhood, but their growth usually catches up with that of their peers during puberty. Hand abnormalities are common in this syndrome and include:\n\n* Short fingers (brachydactyly)\n* Curved pinky fingers (fifth finger clinodactyly)\n* Webbing of the skin between some fingers (cutaneous syndactyly)\n* Single crease across the palm\n\nAffected individuals can also have wide, flat feet with broad, rounded toes.

Most individuals with Aarskog-Scott syndrome have normal intelligence; however, some may have mild learning and behavior problems, and in rare cases, severe intellectual disability has been reported.\n\n**Causes**\n\nVariants (also known as mutations) in the FGD1 gene are the only known genetic cause of Aarskog-Scott syndrome. The FGD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that turns on (activates) another protein called Cdc42, which transmits signals that are important for various aspects of development before and after birth.\n\nVariants in the FGD1 gene lead to the production of an abnormally functioning protein. These variants disrupt Cdc42 signaling, leading to the wide variety of abnormalities that occur in people with Aarskog-Scott syndrome.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nWhen caused by FGD1 gene variants, Aarskog-Scott syndrome is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The FGD1 gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition.\n\nIn females (who have two X chromosomes), a variant would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause Aarskog-Scott syndrome. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females.\n\nFemales who carry one altered copy of the FGD1 gene may show mild signs of the condition, such as hypertelorism, short stature, or a widow's peak hairline. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.\n\nEvidence suggests that Aarskog-Scott syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern in some families, although the genetic cause of these cases is unknown.\n\n---\n\n**Aarskog-Scott Syndrome**\n\n**Inheritance Patterns**\n\nEvidence suggests that Aarskog-Scott syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern in some families, although the genetic cause of these cases is unknown.\n\n*   **Autosomal Dominant Inheritance**: One copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n*   **Autosomal Recessive Inheritance**: Both copies of the gene in each cell have variants.

It is caused by mutations in the FGD1 gene.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe cause of Aarskog-Scott syndrome is a mutation in the FGD1 gene, which codes for a protein involved in cell signaling pathways. The risk factors for this condition include family history, as it can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.\n\n**Symptoms and Signs**\n\nThe symptoms and signs of Aarskog-Scott syndrome may vary in severity and include:\n\n* Physical abnormalities such as cleft lip and palate, craniofacial anomalies, and congenital heart defects\n* Developmental delays and learning disabilities\n* Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n* Variable clinical expression due to different FGD1 gene mutations\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis of Aarskog-Scott syndrome is typically made through genetic testing, which can identify mutations in the FGD1 gene.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for Aarskog-Scott syndrome, but treatment and management strategies may include:\n\n* Early intervention and therapy to address developmental delays and learning disabilities\n* Medications to manage ADHD symptoms\n* Surgical interventions for physical abnormalities\n* Genetic counseling for families with a history of the condition\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with Aarskog-Scott syndrome varies depending on the severity of the symptoms and the effectiveness of treatment. With early intervention and appropriate management, many individuals can lead fulfilling lives despite their challenges.\n\n**Genetics and Inheritance**\n\nAarskog-Scott syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a mutation in one copy of the FGD1 gene is sufficient to cause the condition. Understanding genetics and inheritance patterns can help families with a history of the condition make informed decisions about prenatal testing and family planning.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Cleft Lip and Palate\n* Congenital Heart Defects\n* Craniofacial Abnormalities\n* Genetic Disorders\n* Learning Disabilities",

Abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine are in a class of medications called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). They work by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although the combination of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people.\n\n\\n\\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nThe combination of abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food two times a day. Take abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nAbacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine helps to control HIV infection but does not cure it. Continue to take abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine, or skip doses, your condition may become more difficult to treat, or you could have an allergic reaction when restarting the medication (See Important Warning section).\n\n---\n\n**Abacavir, Lamivudine, and Zidovudine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Content:**\n\nor skip doses, your condition may become more difficult to treat, or you could have an allergic reaction when restarting the medication (See Important Warning section).\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine,\n\n* tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to any of the ingredients in abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine tablets.

It is usually given by a doctor or nurse in a doctor's office or healthcare facility when given intravenously. It also may be given subcutaneously by a doctor or nurse or you or a caregiver may be told to inject the medication subcutaneously at home.\n\nWhen abatacept is given intravenously to treat rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis, it is usually given every 2 weeks for the first 3 doses and then every 4 weeks for as long as treatment continues.\n\nWhen abatacept is given intravenously to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children 6 years and older, it is usually given every two weeks for the first two doses and then every four weeks for as long as treatment continues.\n\nIf you are receiving abatacept intravenously to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children 6 years of age and older, it will take about 30 minutes for you to receive your entire dose.\n\nWhen abatacept is given subcutaneously to treat rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis in adults and children 2 years of age and older and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children 2 years and older, it is usually given once weekly.\n\nWhen abatacept is given intravenously to prevent graft versus host disease, it is usually injected slowly over 60 minutes on the day before hematopoietic stem-cell transplant and then on days 5, 14, and 28 after the transplant.\n\n---\n\n**Abatacept Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 2/5)**\n\n\\n\\n**Administration Instructions**\n\nWhen given intravenously to treat rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis, it is usually given every 2 weeks for the first 3 doses and then every 4 weeks for as long as treatment continues.\n\nWhen given intravenously to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children 6 years and older, it is usually given every two weeks for the first two doses and then every four weeks for as long as treatment continues.\n\nIf you are receiving abatacept intravenously to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children 6 years of age and older, it will take about 30 minutes for you to receive your entire dose.\n\nWhen given subcutaneously to treat rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis in adults and children 2 years of age and older and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children 2 years and older, it is usually given once weekly.\n\nWhen given intravenously to prevent graft versus host disease, it is usually injected slowly over 60 minutes on the day before hematopoietic stem-cell transplant and then on days 5, 14, and 28 after the transplant.\n\n**Self-Injection Instructions**\n\nIf you will be injecting abatacept injection by yourself at home or having a friend or relative inject the medication for you, ask your doctor to show you or the person who will be injecting the medication how to inject it.

Many x-rays or CT scans over time may increase your risk for cancer. However, the risk from any one scan is small. Most modern scanners are able to reduce the radiation exposure. Talk to your provider about this risk and the benefit of the test for getting a correct diagnosis of your medical problem.\n\nSome people have allergies to contrast dye. Let your provider know if you have ever had an allergic reaction to injected contrast dye.\n\nThe most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. If you have an iodine allergy, you may have nausea or vomiting, sneezing, itching, or hives if you get this type of contrast. If you must be given such contrast, your provider may give you antihistamines (such as Benadryl) or steroids before the test.\n\nYour kidneys help remove IV dye from the body. You may need extra fluids after the test to help flush the iodine out of your body if you have kidney disease or diabetes.\n\nRarely, the dye may cause a life-threatening allergic response. Tell the scanner operator right away if you have any trouble breathing during the test. Scanners come with an intercom and speakers, so the operator can hear you at all times.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nComputed tomography scan - abdomen; CT scan - abdomen; CT abdomen and pelvis\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\nFollow your provider's instructions for preparing for the test and any necessary precautions after the test.\n\n**Images**\n\n* CT scan\n* Digestive system\n* Liver cirrhosis - CT scan\n* Liver metastases, CT scan\n* Lymph node metastases, CT scan\n* Lymphoma, malignant - CT scan\n* Pancreatic cancer, CT scan\n* Pancreatic pseudocyst - CT scan\n* Peritoneal and ovarian cancer, CT scan\n* Spleen and liver metastases – CT scan\n* Normal external abdomen\n\n**References**\n\nAl Sarraf AA, McLaughlin PD, Maher MM.

No side effects from the magnetic fields and radio waves have been reported.\n\nThe most common type of contrast (dye) used is gadolinium. It is very safe. Allergic reactions are rare but can occur. If you have a history of severe allergic reactions to other medicines you should notify your doctor. In addition, gadolinium can be harmful to people with kidney problems who need dialysis. Tell your provider before the test if you have kidney problems.\n\nThe strong magnetic fields created during an MRI can cause heart pacemakers and other implants not to work as well. The magnets can also cause a piece of metal inside your body to move or shift.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan.\n\nTell your health care provider if you are afraid of close spaces (have claustrophobia). You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious. Your provider may also suggest an open MRI, in which the machine is not as close to your body.\n\nBefore the test, tell your provider if you have:\n\n* Artificial heart valves\n* Brain aneurysm clips\n* Heart defibrillator or pacemaker\n* Inner ear (cochlear) implants\n* Kidney disease or dialysis (you may not be able to receive contrast)\n* Recently placed artificial joints\n* Certain types of vascular stents\n* Worked with sheet metal in the past (you may need tests to check for metal pieces in your eyes)\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nYou will lie on a narrow table. The table slides into a large tunnel-shaped scanner.\n\nSome exams require a special dye (contrast). Most of the time, the dye is given during the test through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. The dye helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly.\n\nDuring the MRI, the person who operates the machine will watch you from another room.

If you are taking pain pills 3 or 4 times a day, try taking them at the same times each day for 3 to 4 days. They may be more effective this way.\n\t+ Get up and move around if you are having some pain in your belly. This may ease your pain.\n\t+ Press a pillow over your incision when you cough or sneeze to ease discomfort and protect your incision.\n* **Wound Care**\n\t+ Change the dressing over your surgical wound once a day, or sooner if it becomes soiled.

    "content": "**Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair - Open**\n\nOpen abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is surgery to fix a widened part in your aorta. This is called an aneurysm. The aorta is the large artery that carries blood from your heart to your belly (abdomen), pelvis, and legs.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe surgery will take place in an operating room. You will be given general anesthesia (you will be asleep and pain-free).\n\nYour surgeon opens up your belly and replaces the aortic aneurysm with a man-made, cloth-like material.\n\nThere are two approaches to this surgery:\n\n*   **Lying on your back**: The surgeon makes a cut in the middle of your belly, from just below the breastbone to below the belly button. Rarely, the cut goes across the belly.\n*   **Lying slightly tilted on your right side**: The surgeon makes a 5- to 6-inch (13 to 15 centimeters) cut from the left side of your belly, ending a little below your belly button.\n\nYour surgeon will replace the aneurysm with a long tube made of man-made (synthetic) cloth. It is sewn in with stitches.\n\nIn some cases, the ends of this tube (or graft) will be moved through blood vessels in each groin and attached to those in the leg.\n\nOnce the surgery is done, your legs will be examined to make sure that there is a pulse. Most often a dye test using x-rays is done to confirm that there is good blood flow to the legs.\n\nThe cut is closed with sutures or staples.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nOpen surgery to repair an AAA is sometimes done as an emergency procedure when there is bleeding inside your body from the aneurysm.\n\nYou may have an AAA that is not causing any symptoms or problems. Your health care provider may have found the problem after you had an ultrasound or CT scan done for another reason. There is a risk that this aneurysm may suddenly break open (rupture) if you do not have surgery to repair it. However, surgery to repair the aneurysm may also be risky, depending on your overall health.\n\nYou and your provider must decide whether the risk of having this surgery is smaller than the risk for rupture. Surgery is more likely to be suggested if the aneurysm is:\n\n*   Larger (about 2 inches or 5 centimeters)\n*   Growing more quickly (a little less than 1/4 inch over the last 6 to 12 months)\n\n**Risks**\n\nThe risks for this surgery are higher if you have:\n\n*   Heart disease\n*   Kidney failure\n*   Lung disease\n*   Past stroke\n*   Other serious medical problems\n\nComplications are also higher for older people.\n\nRisks for any surgery are:\n\n*   Blood clots in the legs that may travel to the lungs\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Heart attack or stroke\n*   Infection, including in the lungs (pneumonia), urinary tract, and belly\n*   Reactions to medicines\n\nRisks for this surgery are:\n\n*   Bleeding before or after surgery\n*   Damage to a nerve, causing pain or numbness in the leg\n*   Damage to your intestines or other nearby organs\n*   Loss of blood supply to a portion of the large intestine causing delayed bleeding in the stool\n*   Infection of the graft\n*   Injury to the ureter, the tube that carries urine from your kidneys to your bladder\n*   Kidney failure that may be permanent\n*   Lower sex drive or inability to get an erection\n*   Poor blood supply to your legs, your kidneys, or other organs\n*   Spinal cord injury\n*   Wound breaks open\n*   Wound infections\n*   Death\n\n---\n\n**Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair - Open**\n\n**What is an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm?**\n\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a widened part in the large artery that carries blood from your heart to your belly, pelvis, and legs. This condition occurs when part of the aorta becomes too large or balloons outward.\n\n**Why is Open Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair Necessary?**\n\nOpen abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is surgery to fix a widened part in your aorta. If left untreated, an AAA may suddenly break open (rupture), which can be life-threatening. Surgery to repair the aneurysm may also be risky, depending on your overall health.\n\n**Who May Need Open Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair?**\n\nYou may have an AAA that is not causing any symptoms or problems. Your healthcare provider may have found the problem after you had an ultrasound or CT scan done for another reason. Surgery to repair the aneurysm may be suggested if:\n\n* The aneurysm is larger (about 2 inches or 5 centimeters)\n* The aneurysm is growing more quickly (a little less than 1/4 inch over the last 6 to 12 months)\n\n**Risks Associated with Open Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair**\n\nThe risks for this surgery are higher if you have:\n\n* Heart disease\n* Kidney failure\n* Lung disease\n* Past stroke\n* Other serious medical problems\n\nComplications are also higher for older people.\n\n**Preparation for Surgery**\n\nBefore the procedure, you will have a physical exam and get tests. Always tell your provider what medicines you are taking, even drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription. If you are a smoker, you should stop smoking at least 4 weeks before your surgery. Your provider can help.\n\nDuring the 2 weeks before your surgery:\n\n* You will have visits with your provider to make sure medical problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart or lung problems are well treated.\n* You may be asked to stop taking drugs that make it harder for your blood to clot.\n\n**The Procedure**\n\nOpen abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is surgery to fix a widened part in your aorta. The procedure takes place in an operating room, where you will be given general anesthesia (you will be asleep and pain-free).\n\nYour surgeon opens up your belly and replaces the aortic aneurysm with a man-made, cloth-like material.\n\nHere is how it can be done:\n\n* In one approach, you will lie on your back.

During a hospital stay, you will:\n\n* Be in the intensive care unit (ICU), where you will be monitored very closely right after surgery.\n* Have a urinary catheter.\n* Have a tube that goes through your nose into your stomach to help drain fluids for 1 or 2 days.\n* Receive medicine to keep your blood thin.\n* Be encouraged to sit on the side of the bed and then walk.\n* Wear special stockings to prevent blood clots in your legs.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nFull recovery for open surgery to repair an aortic aneurysm may take 2 or 3 months. Most people make a full recovery from this surgery.\n\n---\n\n**Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair - Open**\n\n**Description**\n\nThe surgery for repairing an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) involves replacing the damaged section of the aorta with a man-made, cloth-like material.

It can be anywhere between the chest and groin.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nWhen your child complains of abdominal pain, see if they can describe it to you. Here are different kinds of pain:\n\n*   **Generalized pain**: pain over more than half of the belly. Your child can have this kind of pain when they have a stomach virus, indigestion, gas, or when they become constipated.\n*   **Cramp-like pain**: likely to be due to gas and bloating. It is often followed by diarrhea. It is usually not serious.\n*   **Colicky pain**: pain that comes in waves, usually starts and ends suddenly, and is often severe.\n*   **Localized pain**: pain in only one area of the belly. Your child may be having problems with their appendix, gallbladder, a hernia (twisted bowel), ovary, testicles, or stomach (ulcers).\n\nIf you have an infant or toddler, your child depends on you seeing that they are in pain. Suspect abdominal pain if your child is:\n\n*   More fussy than usual\n*   Drawing their legs up toward the belly\n*   Eating poorly\n\n**Causes**\n\nYour child could have abdominal pain for many reasons. It can be hard to know what is going on when your child has abdominal pain. Most of the time, there is nothing seriously wrong. But sometimes, it can be a sign that there is something serious and your child needs medical care.\n\nYour child most likely is having abdominal pain from something that is not life threatening. For example, your child may have:\n\n*   Air swallowing\n*   Abdominal migraine\n*   Colic\n*   Constipation\n*   Gas\n*   Food allergy or intolerance\n*   Food poisoning\n*   Heartburn or acid reflux\n*   Ingesting grass or plants\n*   Mononucleosis (\"mono\")\n*   Stomach flu\n*   Strep throat\n*   Pain caused by anxiety or depression\n\nYour child may have something more serious if the pain does not get better in 24 hours, gets worse or gets more frequent.

Contact your provider if it is getting more severe and frequent, or if your child is nauseous and vomiting with it.\nA burning sensation during urination.\nDiarrhea for more than 2 days.\nVomiting for more than 12 hours.\nFever over 100.4°F (38°C).\nPoor appetite for more than 2 days.\nUnexplained weight loss.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nTalk to your provider about the location of the pain and its time pattern. Let your provider know if there are other symptoms like fever, fatigue, general ill feeling, change in behavior, nausea, vomiting, or changes in stool.\n\nYour provider may ask the questions about the abdominal pain:\n\nWhat part of the stomach hurts? All over? Lower or upper? Right, left, or middle? Around the navel?\nIs the pain sharp or cramping, constant or comes and goes, or changes in intensity over minutes?\nDoes the pain wake your child up at night?\nHas your child had similar pain in the past? How long has each episode lasted? How often has it occurred?\nIs the pain getting more severe?\nDoes the pain get worse after eating or drinking? After eating greasy foods, milk products, or carbonated drinks? Has your child started eating something new?\nDoes the pain get better after eating or having a bowel movement?\nDoes the pain get worse after stress?\nHas there been a recent injury?\nWhat other symptoms are occurring at the same time?\n\nDuring the physical examination, your provider will test to see if the pain is in a single area (point tenderness) or whether it is spread out.\n\nThey may do some tests to check on the cause of the pain. The tests may include:\n\nBlood, urine, and stool tests\nCT (computerized tomography, or advanced imaging) scan\nUltrasound (sound wave examination) of the abdomen\nX-rays of the abdomen and chest\n\n---\n\n**Abdominal Pain in Children Under Age 12**\n\nAlmost all children have abdominal pain at one time or another.

It's essential to understand that the severity of abdominal pain doesn't always indicate the gravity of the underlying condition.\n\n**Types of Abdominal Pain**\n\nThere are several types of abdominal pain, including:\n\n*   **Generalized pain**: This type of pain is felt throughout more than half of the abdomen and is often associated with conditions like stomach viruses, indigestion, or gas.\n*   **Localized pain**: This type of pain is confined to a specific area of the abdomen and may indicate a problem with an organ such as the appendix, gallbladder, or stomach.\n*   **Cramp-like pain**: This type of pain is typically not serious and is often caused by gas and bloating. It may be followed by diarrhea.\n*   **Colicky pain**: This type of pain comes in waves and can be severe. Kidney stones and gallstones are common causes of this type of abdominal pain.\n\n**Causes of Abdominal Pain**\n\nMany different conditions can cause abdominal pain, including:\n\n*   Constipation\n*   Irritable bowel syndrome\n*   Food allergies or intolerance (such as lactose intolerance)\n*   Food poisoning\n*   Stomach flu\n*   Appendicitis\n*   Abdominal aortic aneurysm (bulging and weakening of the major artery in the body)\n*   Bowel blockage or obstruction\n*   Cancer of the stomach, colon (large bowel), and other organs\n*   Cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) with or without gallstones\n*   Decreased blood supply to the intestines (ischemic bowel)\n*   Diverticulitis (inflammation and infection of the colon)\n*   Endometriosis\n*   Heartburn, indigestion, or gastroesophageal reflux (GERD)\n*   Hernia in which the intestine is stuck or twisted\n*   Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis)\n*   Kidney stones\n*   Muscle strain\n*   Pancreatitis (swelling or infection of the pancreas)\n*   Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\n*   Ruptured ovarian cyst\n*   Severe menstrual cramps\n*   Tubal (ectopic) pregnancy\n*   Ulcers\n*   Urinary tract infections (UTI)\n\n**Home Care**\n\nFor mild abdominal pain, you can try the following home care steps:\n\n1.  **Sip water or other clear fluids**: You may have sports drinks in small amounts. People with diabetes must check their blood sugar often and adjust their medicines as needed.\n2.  **Avoid solid food for the first few hours**.\n3.  If you have been vomiting, wait 6 hours, and then eat small amounts of mild foods such as rice, applesauce, or crackers. Avoid dairy products.\n4.  If the pain is high up in your abdomen and occurs after meals, antacids may help, especially if you feel heartburn or indigestion. Avoid citrus, high-fat foods, fried or greasy foods, tomato products, caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated beverages.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nGet medical help right away or call 911 or the local emergency number if you:\n\n*   Are currently being treated for cancer\n*   Are unable to pass stool, especially if you are also vomiting\n*   Are vomiting blood or have blood in your stool (especially if bright red, maroon or dark, tarry black)\n*   Have chest, neck, or shoulder pain\n*   Have sudden, sharp abdominal pain\n*   Have pain in, or between, your shoulder blades with nausea\n*   Have tenderness in your belly, or your belly is rigid and hard to the touch\n*   Are pregnant or could be pregnant\n*   Had a recent injury to your abdomen\n*   Have difficulty breathing\n\nContact your provider if you have:\n\n*   Abdominal discomfort that lasts 1 week or longer\n*   Abdominal pain that does not improve in 24 to 48 hours, or becomes more severe and frequent and occurs with nausea and vomiting\n*   Bloating that persists for more than 2 days\n*   Burning sensation when you urinate or frequent urination\n*   Diarrhea for more than 5 days\n*   Fever, over 100°F (37.7°C) for adults or 100.4°F (38°C) for children, with pain\n*   Prolonged poor appetite\n*   Prolonged vaginal bleeding\n*   Unexplained weight loss\n*   Unable to keep down any foods or liquids\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms and medical history. Your specific symptoms, the location of pain and when it occurs will help your provider detect the cause.\n\nLOCATION OF YOUR PAIN\n\nWhere do you feel the pain?\nIs it all over or in one spot?\nDoes the pain move into your back, groin, or down your legs?\n\nTYPE AND INTENSITY OF YOUR PAIN\n\nIs the pain severe, sharp, or cramping?\nDo you have it all the time, or does it come and go?\nDoes the pain wake you up at night?\n\nHISTORY OF YOUR PAIN\n\nHave you had similar pain in the past? How long has each episode lasted?\nWhen does the pain occur? For example, after meals or during menstruation?\nWhat makes the pain worse? For example, eating, stress, or lying down?\nWhat makes the pain better? For example, drinking milk, having a bowel movement, or taking an antacid?\nWhat medicines are you taking?\n\nOTHER MEDICAL HISTORY\n\nHave you had a recent injury?\nAre you pregnant?\nWhat other symptoms do you have?\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n*   Barium enema\n*   Blood, urine, and stool tests\n*   CT scan\n*   Colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy (tube through the rectum into the colon)\n*   Electrocardiogram (ECG) or heart tracing\n*   Ultrasound of the abdomen\n*   Upper endoscopy (tube through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach and upper small intestine)\n*   Upper GI (gastrointestinal) and small bowel series\n*   X-rays of the abdomen\n\n---\n\n**Abdominal Pain**\n\nAlmost everyone has pain in the abdomen at some point. Most of the time, it is not serious.\n\n**How Bad Your Pain Is Does Not Always Reflect the Seriousness of the Condition Causing the Pain**\n\nFor example, you might have very bad abdominal pain if you have gas or stomach cramps due to viral gastroenteritis.\n\nHowever, potentially fatal conditions, such as colon cancer or early appendicitis, may only cause mild pain or no pain.\n\n**Other Ways to Describe Pain in Your Abdomen Include:**\n\n*   **Generalized pain**: This means that you feel it in more than half of your belly. This type of pain is more typical for a stomach virus, indigestion, or gas. If the pain becomes more severe, it may be caused by a blockage of the intestines.\n*   **Localized pain**: This is pain found in only one area of your belly. It is more likely to be a sign of a problem in an organ, such as the appendix, gallbladder, or stomach.\n*   **Cramp-like pain**: This type of pain is not serious most of the time. It is likely to be due to gas and bloating, and is often followed by diarrhea. More worrisome signs include pain that occurs more often, lasts more than 24 hours, or occurs with a fever or rectal bleeding.\n*   **Colicky pain**: This type of pain comes in waves. It very often starts and ends suddenly, and is often severe. Kidney stones and gallstones are common causes of this type of belly pain.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMany different conditions can cause abdominal pain. The key is to know when you need to get medical care right away. Sometimes, you may only need to contact a health care provider if your symptoms continue.\n\nLess serious causes of abdominal pain include:\n\n*   Constipation\n*   Irritable bowel syndrome\n*   Food allergies or intolerance (such as lactose intolerance)\n*   Food poisoning\n*   Stomach flu\n\nOther possible causes include:\n\n*   Appendicitis\n*   Abdominal aortic aneurysm (bulging and weakening of the major artery in the body)\n*   Bowel blockage or obstruction\n*   Cancer of the stomach, colon (large bowel), and other organs\n*   Cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) with or without gallstones\n*   Decreased blood supply to the intestines (ischemic bowel)\n*   Diverticulitis (inflammation and infection of the colon)\n*   Endometriosis\n*   Heartburn, indigestion, or gastroesophageal reflux (GERD)\n*   Hernia in which the intestine is stuck or twisted\n*   Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis)\n*   Kidney stones\n*   Muscle strain\n*   Pancreatitis (swelling or infection of the pancreas)\n*   Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\n*   Ruptured ovarian cyst\n*   Severe menstrual cramps\n*   Tubal (ectopic) pregnancy\n*   Ulcers\n*   Urinary tract infections (UTI)\n\n**Home Care**\n\nYou can try the following home care steps to ease mild abdominal pain:\n\nSip water or other clear fluids. You may have sports drinks in small amounts. People with diabetes must check their blood sugar often and adjust their medicines as needed.\n\nAvoid solid food for the first few hours.\n\nIf you have been vomiting, wait 6 hours, and then eat small amounts of mild foods such as rice, applesauce, or crackers. Avoid dairy products.\n\nIf the pain is high up in your abdomen and occurs after meals, antacids may help, especially if you feel heartburn or indigestion. Avoid citrus, high-fat foods, fried or greasy foods, tomato products, caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated beverages.\n\nDO NOT take any medicine without talking to your provider.\n\nThese additional steps may help prevent some types of abdominal pain:\n\nDrink plenty of water each day.\n\nEat small meals more frequently.\n\nExercise regularly.\n\nLimit foods that produce gas.\n\nMake sure that your meals are well-balanced and high in fiber. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables.\n\n---\n\n**Abdominal Pain**\n\nAre you experiencing abdominal pain?

    "content": "**Abdominal Radiation - Discharge**\n\nWhen you have radiation treatment for cancer, your body goes through changes. Follow your health care provider's instructions on how to care for yourself at home. Use the information below as a reminder.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nAbout 2 weeks after radiation treatment starts, you might notice changes in your skin. Most of these symptoms go away after your treatments have stopped.\n\n* Your skin and mouth may turn red.\n* Your skin might start to peel or get dark.\n* Your skin may itch.\n* Your body hair will fall out after about 2 weeks, but only in the area being treated. When your hair grows back, it may be different than before.\n* Around the second or third week after radiation treatments start, you may have:\n\t+ Diarrhea\n\t+ Cramping in your belly\n\t+ An upset stomach\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Skin Care**\n\nWhen you have radiation treatment, color markings are drawn on your skin. Do not remove them. These show where to aim the radiation. If they come off, do not redraw them. Tell your provider instead.\n\nTo take care of the treatment area:\n\n* Wash gently with lukewarm water only. Don't scrub.\n* Use a mild soap that doesn't dry out your skin.\n* Pat your skin dry.\n* Don't use lotions, ointments, makeup, perfumed powders, or products on the treatment area. Ask your provider what you should use.\n* Keep the area that is being treated out of the direct sun.\n* Don't scratch or rub your skin.\n* Don't put a heating pad or an ice bag on the treatment area.\n\nTell your provider if you have any break or opening in your skin.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Self-care**\n\nWear loose-fitting clothing around your stomach and pelvis.\n\nYou will likely feel tired after a few weeks. If so:\n\n* Don't try to do too much. You probably will not be able to do everything you used to.\n* Try to get more sleep at night.

Follow your health care provider's instructions on how to care for yourself at home. Use the information below as a reminder.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nAbout 2 weeks after radiation treatment starts, you might notice changes in your skin. Most of these symptoms go away after your treatments have stopped.\n\n* Your skin and mouth may turn red.\n* Your skin might start to peel or get dark.\n* Your skin may itch.\n\nYour body hair will fall out after about 2 weeks, but only in the area being treated. When your hair grows back, it may be different than before.\n\nAround the second or third week after radiation treatments start, you may have:\n\n* Diarrhea\n* Cramping in your belly\n* An upset stomach\n\n**Skin Care**\n\nWhen you have radiation treatment, color markings are drawn on your skin. Do not remove them. These show where to aim the radiation. If they come off, do not redraw them. Tell your provider instead.\n\nTo take care of the treatment area:\n\n* Wash gently with lukewarm water only. Don't scrub.\n* Use a mild soap that doesn't dry out your skin.\n* Pat your skin dry.\n* Don't use lotions, ointments, makeup, perfumed powders, or products on the treatment area.

    "content": "**Abdominal Rigidity**\n\nAbdominal rigidity is stiffness of the muscles in the belly area, which can be felt when touched or pressed.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nWhen there is a sore area inside the belly or abdomen, the pain will often get worse when a hand presses against your belly area. Your fear or nervousness about being touched (palpated) may cause your abdominal muscles to stiffen, but there should be no pain. If you have pain when you are touched and you tighten the muscles to guard against more pain, it is more likely caused by a physical condition inside your abdomen. The condition may affect one or both sides of your body.\n\n**Abdominal Rigidity May Occur With:**\n\n* Abdominal tenderness\n* Nausea\n* Pain\n* Swelling\n* Vomiting\n\n**Causes**\n\nCauses can include:\n\n* Abscess inside the abdomen\n* Appendicitis\n* Cholecystitis caused by gallstones\n* Hole that develops through the entire wall of the stomach, small intestine, large bowel, or gallbladder (gastrointestinal perforation)\n* Injury to the abdomen\n* Peritonitis\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nGet medical care right away if you have pain when the belly is gently pressed and then released.\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYou will probably be seen in an emergency room.

They are an important indicator of the gastrointestinal tract's functioning.\n\n**Considerations**\n\n* Abdominal sounds are made by the movement of the intestines as they push food through.\n* The intestines are hollow, so bowel sounds echo through the abdomen much like the sounds heard from water pipes.\n* Most bowel sounds are normal and indicate a healthy digestive system.\n* However, abnormal sounds can be a sign of a problem. A healthcare provider can check abdominal sounds by listening to the abdomen with a stethoscope (auscultation).\n\n**Ileus**\n\n* Ileus is a condition in which there is a lack of intestinal activity.\n* Many medical conditions may lead to ileus, causing gas, fluids, and contents to build up and potentially rupture the bowel wall.\n* In severe cases, this can lead to death (necrosis) of the bowel tissue.\n\n**Reduced (Hypoactive) Bowel Sounds**\n\n* Reduced bowel sounds indicate a slowdown in intestinal activity.\n* This is normal during sleep or for a short time after certain medications or abdominal surgery.\n* Decreased or absent bowel sounds often indicate constipation.\n\n**Increased (Hyperactive) Bowel Sounds**\n\n* Increased bowel sounds mean an increase in intestinal activity.\n* This may happen with diarrhea or after eating.\n* Very high-pitched bowel sounds can be a sign of early bowel obstruction.\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Most abdominal sounds are due to normal digestion and are not a cause for concern.\n* Many conditions can cause hyperactive or hypoactive bowel sounds, but most are harmless and do not need treatment.\n* Serious conditions that may cause abnormal bowel sounds include:\n\t+ Blocked blood vessels preventing proper blood flow to the intestines\n\t+ Mechanical bowel obstruction caused by hernia, tumor, adhesions, or similar conditions\n\t+ Paralytic ileus, a problem with the nerves to the intestines\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\n* If you experience any of the following symptoms:\n\t+ Bleeding from your rectum\n\t+ Nausea\n\t+ Diarrhea or constipation that continues\n\t+ Vomiting\n\n---\n\n**Abdominal Sounds**\n\nAbdominal sounds, also known as bowel sounds, are the noises made by the movement of food through the intestines. The intestines are hollow, so these sounds echo through the abdomen much like the sounds heard from water pipes.\n\n**Most Bowel Sounds Are Normal**\n\nMost bowel sounds are normal and simply mean that the gastrointestinal tract is working. However, there are some cases in which abnormal sounds can indicate a problem. A health care provider can check abdominal sounds by listening to the abdomen with a stethoscope (auscultation).\n\n**Reduced (Hypoactive) Bowel Sounds**\n\nReduced bowel sounds include a reduction in the loudness, tone, or regularity of the sounds. They are a sign that intestinal activity has slowed.\n\n* Hypoactive bowel sounds are normal during sleep.\n* They also occur normally for a short time after the use of certain medicines and after abdominal surgery.\n* Decreased or absent bowel sounds often indicate constipation.\n\n**Increased (Hyperactive) Bowel Sounds**\n\nIncreased bowel sounds can sometimes be heard even without a stethoscope. Hyperactive bowel sounds mean there is an increase in intestinal activity. This may happen with diarrhea or after eating.\n\n**Abdominal Sounds Are Always Evaluated Together With Symptoms**\n\nAbdominal sounds are always evaluated together with symptoms such as:\n\n* Gas\n* Nausea\n* Presence or absence of bowel movements\n* Vomiting\n\nIf bowel sounds are hypoactive or hyperactive and there are other abnormal symptoms, you should continue to follow-up with your provider.\n\n**For Example, No Bowel Sounds After A Period Of Hyperactive Bowel Sounds Can Mean There Is A Rupture Of The Intestines**\n\nNo bowel sounds after a period of hyperactive bowel sounds can mean there is a rupture of the intestines, or strangulation of the bowel and death (necrosis) of the bowel tissue.\n\n**Very High-Pitched Bowel Sounds May Be A Sign Of Early Bowel Obstruction**\n\nVery high-pitched bowel sounds may be a sign of early bowel obstruction.\n\n---\n\n**Abdominal Sounds**\n\nAbdominal sounds, also known as bowel sounds, are made by the movement of the intestines as they push food through.

For example, blood clots can cause mesenteric artery occlusion.\n* Mechanical bowel obstruction is caused by hernia, tumor, adhesions, or similar conditions that can block the intestines.\n* Paralytic ileus is a problem with the nerves to the intestines.\n\nOther causes of hypoactive bowel sounds include:\n\n* Medicines that slow down movement in the intestines such as opioids (including codeine), anticholinergics, and phenothiazines\n* General anesthesia\n* Radiation to the abdomen\n* Spinal anesthesia\n* Surgery in the abdomen\n\nOther causes of hyperactive bowel sounds include:\n\n* Crohn disease\n* Diarrhea\n* Food allergy\n* GI bleeding\n* Infectious enteritis\n* Ulcerative colitis\n\n---\n\n**Abdominal Sounds**\n\nYou may be given medicine to reduce symptoms and to treat the cause of the problem. The type of medicine will depend on the cause of the problem. Some people may need surgery right away.\n\n**What to Expect in the Doctor's Office**\n\nThe provider will examine you and ask you questions about your medical history and symptoms. You may be asked:\n\n* What are your symptoms?\n* How long have you had them?\n* Have they changed over time?\n\nYou may need the following tests:\n\n* Imaging tests, such as X-rays or CT scans\n* Laboratory tests, such as blood work or stool tests\n\n**What Happens if There's an Emergency?**\n\nIf there are signs of an emergency, you will be sent to the hospital. A tube may be placed through your nose or mouth into the stomach or the upper intestine. This empties your stomach or upper intestine. In most cases, you will not be allowed to eat or drink anything so your intestines can rest. You will be given fluids through a vein (intravenously).\n\n**References**\n\n* Ball JW, Dains JE, Flynn JA, Solomon BS, Stewart RW. Abdomen.

    "content": "**Abdominal Tap**\n\nAn abdominal tap is used to remove fluid (ascites) from the area between the belly wall and the spine. This space is called the abdominal cavity or peritoneal cavity.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test may be done in a health care provider's office, treatment room, or hospital. The puncture site will be cleaned and hair clipped, if necessary. You then receive a local numbing medicine. The tap needle is inserted 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) into the abdomen. Sometimes, a small cut is made to help insert the needle. The fluid is pulled out into a syringe.\n\nThe needle is removed. A dressing is placed on the puncture site. If a cut was made, one or two stitches may be used to close it. Sometimes, ultrasound is used to guide the needle. An ultrasound uses sound waves to make the image and not x-rays. It does not hurt.\n\nThere are 2 kinds of abdominal taps:\n\n* **Diagnostic Tap**: A small amount of fluid (25 to 50 milliliters) is taken and sent to the lab for testing.\n* **Large Volume Tap**: Up to several liters may be removed to relieve abdominal pain and shortness of breath caused by a large volume of ascites.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nLet your provider know if you:\n\n* Have any allergies to medicines or numbing medicine\n* Are taking any medicines (including herbal remedies)\n* Have any bleeding problems\n* Might be pregnant\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nYou may feel a slight sting from the numbing medicine, or pressure as the needle is inserted. If a large amount of fluid is taken out, you may feel dizzy or lightheaded. Tell your provider if you feel dizzy or lightheaded.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nNormally, the abdominal cavity contains only a small amount of fluid if any. In certain conditions, large amounts of fluid can build up in this space. An abdominal tap can help diagnose the cause of fluid buildup or the presence of an infection. It may also be done to remove a large amount of fluid to reduce belly pain or shortness of breath.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormally, there should be little or no fluid in the abdominal space.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAn exam of abdominal fluid may show:\n\n* Cancer that has spread to the abdominal cavity (most often cancer of the ovaries)\n* Cirrhosis of the liver\n* Damaged bowel\n* Heart failure\n* Infection\n* Kidney disease\n* Pancreatic disease (inflammation or cancer)\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is a slight chance that the needle could puncture the bowel, bladder, or a blood vessel in the abdomen. If a large quantity of fluid is removed, there is a slight risk of lowered blood pressure and kidney problems. You may receive certain IV medicines after the test if you are at high risk for this problem.

    "content": "**Abdominal Thrusts: A Life-Saving Technique**\n\nChoking is a serious condition where someone's airway is blocked, preventing them from breathing properly. If left untreated, brain damage can occur in as little as 4 to 6 minutes. Rapid first aid for choking can save a person's life.\n\n**What are Abdominal Thrusts?**\n\nAbdominal thrusts, also known as the Heimlich maneuver, is an emergency technique used to clear someone's airway. It is performed on a conscious person who is choking.\n\n**Who Should Not Use Abdominal Thrusts?**\n\nMost experts do not recommend abdominal thrusts for infants less than 1 year old.\n\n**How to Perform Abdominal Thrusts**\n\nIf the person is sitting or standing, position yourself behind them and reach your arms around their waist. For a child, you may need to kneel. Place your fist, thumb side in, just above the person's navel (belly button). Grasp the fist tightly with your other hand. Make quick, upward and inward thrusts with your fist.\n\nIf the person is lying on their back, straddle them facing the head. Push your grasped fist upward and inward in a movement similar to the one above.\n\n**What to Do If the Person Loses Consciousness**\n\nIf repeated attempts do not free the airway, call 911 or the local emergency number. If the person loses consciousness, start CPR.\n\n**Can You Perform Abdominal Thrusts on Yourself?**\n\nYes, you can also perform the maneuver on yourself by using a similar technique to the one described above.\n\n**Remember**\n\nA strong cough can often dislodge the object, so first ask, \"Are you choking? Can you speak?\" If the person is coughing forcefully and is able to speak, do not perform first aid.\n\n---\n\n**Abdominal Thrusts: A Life-Saving Technique**\n\nIf someone is choking, you need to act fast. The Heimlich maneuver, also known as abdominal thrusts, can help dislodge the object blocking their airway.\n\n**When to Perform Abdominal Thrusts**\n\nPerform abdominal thrusts if:\n\n*   The person is conscious but unable to speak or cough.\n*   You are not comfortable performing back blows.\n\n**How to Perform Abdominal Thrusts**\n\nTo perform abdominal thrusts, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Position yourself**: Stand behind the person, with your feet shoulder-width apart.\n2.  **Place your fist**: Reach around their waist and place your fist, thumb side in, just above their navel (belly button).\n3.  **Grasp your fist**: With your other hand, grasp your fist tightly.\n4.  **Make thrusts**: Make quick, upward and inward thrusts with your fist.\n\n**Repeating the Procedure**\n\nYou may need to repeat the procedure several times before the object is dislodged. If repeated attempts do not free the airway, call 911 or the local emergency number.\n\n**What to Do if the Person Loses Consciousness**\n\nIf the person loses consciousness, start CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation).\n\n**Alternative Method: Back Blows**\n\nIf you are not comfortable performing abdominal thrusts, you can perform back blows instead on a person who is choking.",

This opening varies in size and can usually be diagnosed early in fetal development, typically between the tenth and fourteenth weeks of pregnancy.\n\n**Types of Abdominal Wall Defects**\n\nThere are two main types of abdominal wall defects: **Omphalocele** and **Gastroschisis**.\n\n*   **Omphalocele**: An opening in the center of the abdominal wall where the umbilical cord meets the abdomen. Organs (typically the intestines, stomach, and liver) protrude through the opening into the umbilical cord and are covered by the same protective membrane that covers the umbilical cord.\n*   **Gastroschisis**: A defect in the abdominal wall, usually to the right of the umbilical cord, through which the large and small intestines protrude (although other organs may sometimes bulge out). There is no membrane covering the exposed organs in gastroschisis.\n\n**Omphalocele**\n\nFetuses with omphalocele may grow slowly before birth (intrauterine growth retardation) and they may be born prematurely. Individuals with omphalocele frequently have multiple birth defects, such as a congenital heart defect. Additionally, underdevelopment of the lungs is often associated with omphalocele because the abdominal organs normally provide a framework for chest wall growth.\n\n**Gastroschisis**\n\nIndividuals who have gastroschisis rarely have other birth defects and seldom have chromosome abnormalities or a genetic condition. Most affected individuals experience intrauterine growth retardation and are small at birth; many affected infants are born prematurely.\n\n**Health Implications**\n\nThe health of an individual with gastroschisis depends largely on how damaged his or her intestine was before birth. When the abdominal wall defect is repaired and normal intestinal function is recovered, the vast majority of affected individuals have no health problems related to the repaired defect later in life.\n\n---\n\n**Abdominal Wall Defect**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is an abdominal wall defect?**\n\nAn abdominal wall defect is an opening in the abdomen through which various abdominal organs can protrude.

There is no membrane covering the exposed organs in gastroschisis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Effects of Abdominal Wall Defects**\n\nThe health effects of abdominal wall defects vary depending on the type and severity of the defect. In general, individuals with abdominal wall defects may experience:\n\n*   **Intrauterine growth retardation**: slow growth before birth\n*   **Premature birth**: many affected infants are born prematurely\n*   **Multiple birth defects**: individuals with omphalocele frequently have multiple birth defects, such as a congenital heart defect\n*   **Respiratory insufficiency**: underdevelopment of the lungs is often associated with omphalocele\n*   **Gastrointestinal problems**: affected infants often have gastrointestinal problems including a backflow of stomach acids into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux) and feeding difficulty\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Long-term Health Effects**\n\nThe long-term health effects of abdominal wall defects depend on the type and severity of the defect. In general, individuals with abdominal wall defects may experience:\n\n*   **No health problems**: when the abdominal wall defect is repaired and normal intestinal function is recovered, the vast majority of affected individuals have no health problems related to the repaired defect later in life\n*   **Short bowel syndrome**: rare cases of intestinal malformations can lead to short bowel syndrome, a condition that occurs when areas of the small intestine are missing, causing dehydration and poor absorption of nutrients\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Genetic Associations**\n\nOmphalocele is a feature of many genetic syndromes. Nearly half of individuals with omphalocele have a condition caused by an extra copy of one of the chromosomes in each of their cells (trisomy). Up to one-third of people born with omphalocele have a genetic condition called Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Affected individuals may have additional signs and symptoms associated with these genetic conditions.\n\nIndividuals who have gastroschisis rarely have other birth defects and seldom have chromosome abnormalities or a genetic condition. Most affected individuals experience intrauterine growth retardation and are small at birth; many affected infants are born prematurely.\n\n---\n\n**Abdominal Wall Defect**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is an abdominal wall defect?**\n\nAn abdominal wall defect is an opening in the abdomen through which various abdominal organs can protrude.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of Abdominal Wall Defects**\n\nThere are two main types of abdominal wall defects: omphalocele and gastroschisis.\n\n*   **Omphalocele**: An opening in the center of the abdominal wall where the umbilical cord meets the abdomen.

Individuals with omphalocele frequently have multiple birth defects, such as a congenital heart defect. Additionally, underdevelopment of the lungs is often associated with omphalocele because the abdominal organs normally provide a framework for chest wall growth. When those organs are misplaced, the chest wall does not form properly, providing a smaller than normal space for the lungs to develop.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Gastroschisis**\n\nIndividuals who have gastroschisis rarely have other birth defects and seldom have chromosome abnormalities or a genetic condition. Most affected individuals experience intrauterine growth retardation and are small at birth; many affected infants are born prematurely. With gastroschisis, the protruding organs are not covered by a protective membrane and are susceptible to damage due to direct contact with amniotic fluid in the womb.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Consequences**\n\nThe health of an individual with omphalocele or gastroschisis depends largely on how damaged their intestine was before birth. In the case of omphalocele, large omphaloceles or those associated with multiple additional health problems are more often associated with fetal death than cases in which omphalocele occurs alone (isolated). Affected infants often have gastrointestinal problems including a backflow of stomach acids into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux) and feeding difficulty; these problems can persist even after treatment of omphalocele.\n\n---\n\n**Abdominal Wall Defect**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nAn abdominal wall defect is a birth defect where the intestines or other organs protrude through an opening in the navel. There are two main types of abdominal wall defects: omphalocele and gastroschisis.\n\n**How common is it?**\n\nAbdominal wall defects are uncommon, affecting approximately 2 to 2.5 in 10,000 newborns with omphalocele and 2 to 6 in 10,000 newborns with gastroschisis.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe causes of abdominal wall defects are not fully understood, but it is thought that multiple genetic and environmental factors play a role in their development. Omphalocele occurs during an error in digestive tract development, while the exact cause of gastroschisis is unknown.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nMost cases of abdominal wall defect are sporadic, meaning they occur in people with no family history of the disorder. When an abdominal wall defect is a feature of a genetic condition, it is inherited in the pattern of that condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAbdominal hernia, gastroschisis, hernia, abdominal, omphalocele\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Information: Genetic Testing Registry: Congenital omphalocele\nPatient Support and Advocacy Resources: National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\nClinical Trials: ClinicalTrials.gov\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM: OMPHALOCELE, AUTOSOMAL; GASTROSCHISIS; OMPHALOCELE, X-LINKED\n\n---\n\n**Abdominal Wall Defect: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Congenital omphalocele\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   Christison-Lagay ER, Kelleher CM, Langer JC.

    "content": "**Abdominal Wall Surgery**\n\nAbdominal wall surgery, also known as a tummy tuck, is a procedure that improves the appearance of flabby, stretched-out abdominal muscles and skin. It can range from a simple mini-tummy tuck to more extensive surgery.\n\n**Description**\n\nYour surgery will be done in an operating room in a hospital. You will receive general anesthesia, which will keep you asleep and pain-free during the procedure. The surgery takes 2 to 6 hours, and you can expect to stay in the hospital for 1 to 3 days after surgery.\n\nAfter you receive anesthesia, your surgeon will make a cut (incision) across your abdomen to open up the area. This cut will be just above your pubic area. Your surgeon will remove fatty tissue and loose skin from the middle and lower sections of your abdomen to make it firmer and flatter. In extended surgeries, the surgeon also removes excess fat and skin (love handles) from the sides of the abdomen. Your abdominal muscles may be tightened also.\n\n**Mini Abdominoplasty**\n\nMini abdominoplasty is performed when there are areas of fat pockets (love handles). It can be done with much smaller cuts.\n\n**Endoscopic Surgery**\n\nFor less complicated surgery, your surgeon may use a medical device called an endoscope. Endoscopes are small cameras that are inserted into the skin through very small cuts. They are connected to a video monitor in the operating room that allows the surgeon to see the area being worked on. Your surgeon will remove excess fat with other small tools that are inserted through other small cuts.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nMost of the time, this surgery is an elective or cosmetic procedure because it is an operation you choose to have. It is not usually needed for health reasons. Cosmetic abdomen repair can help improve appearance, particularly after a lot of weight gain or loss. It helps flatten the lower abdomen and tighten stretched skin.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n* Reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots, or infection\n\nRisks for this surgery are:\n\n* Excessive scarring\n* Loss of skin\n* Nerve damage that can cause pain or numbness in part of your belly\n* Poor healing\n\n---\n\n**Abdominal Wall Surgery**\n\nAbdominal wall surgery, also known as a tummy tuck, is a procedure that improves the appearance of flabby, stretched-out abdominal muscles and skin. It can range from a simple mini-tummy tuck to more extensive surgery.\n\n**What's the Difference Between Abdominal Wall Surgery and Liposuction?**\n\nAbdominal wall surgery is not the same as liposuction, which is another way to remove fat. However, abdominal wall surgery is sometimes combined with liposuction.\n\n**The Procedure**\n\nYour surgery will be done in an operating room in a hospital. You will receive general anesthesia, which will keep you asleep and pain-free during the procedure. The surgery takes 2 to 6 hours, and you can expect to stay in the hospital for 1 to 3 days after surgery.\n\nAfter receiving anesthesia, your surgeon will make a cut (incision) across your abdomen to open up the area.

In extended surgeries, the surgeon also removes excess fat and skin (love handles) from the sides of the abdomen. Your abdominal muscles may be tightened also.\n\n**Types of Surgery**\n\nThere are two main types of surgery:\n\n*   **Extended Abdominoplasty**: This type of surgery involves removing excess fat and skin from the middle and lower sections of the abdomen, as well as the sides.\n*   **Mini Abdominoplasty**: This type of surgery is performed when there are areas of fat pockets (love handles). It can be done with much smaller cuts.\n\n**Recovery**\n\nAfter the procedure, you will have some pain and discomfort for several days. Your surgeon will prescribe pain medicine to help you manage your pain. You should avoid strenuous activity and anything that makes you strain for 4 to 6 weeks. You will probably be able to return to work in 2 to 4 weeks.\n\nYour scars will become flatter and lighter in color over the next year. It's essential to keep them covered when you're out in the sun to prevent darkening of the scar.\n\n**Risks**\n\nAs with any surgery, there are risks involved with abdominal wall surgery. These include:\n\n*   Reactions to medicines\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Bleeding, blood clots, or infection\n*   Excessive scarring\n*   Loss of skin\n*   Nerve damage that can cause pain or numbness in part of your belly\n*   Poor healing\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nBefore surgery, you should:\n\n*   Tell your surgeon or nurse if you could be pregnant\n*   Inform them about any medicines you are taking, including aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)\n*   Stop smoking at least 2 weeks before surgery to reduce the risk of complications\n\nBy understanding the procedure, risks, and recovery process, you can make an informed decision about whether abdominal wall surgery is right for you.\n\n---\n\n**Abdominal Wall Surgery**\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nYou will be given general anesthesia, which will keep you asleep and pain-free during the procedure.\n\nThe surgery takes 2 to 6 hours.

It can be done with much smaller cuts.\n\nYour surgeon will close your cut with stitches. Small tubes called drains may be inserted to allow fluid to drain out of your cut. These will be removed later.\n\nA firm elastic dressing (bandage) will be placed over your abdomen.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nMost of the time, this surgery is an elective or cosmetic procedure because it is an operation you choose to have. It is not usually needed for health reasons.\n\nCosmetic abdomen repair can help improve appearance, particularly after a lot of weight gain or loss. It helps flatten the lower abdomen and tighten stretched skin.\n\nIt may also help relieve skin rashes or infections that develop under large flaps of skin.\n\nAbdominoplasty can be helpful when:\n\n* Diet and exercise have not helped improve muscle tone, such as in women who have had more than one pregnancy.\n* Skin and muscle cannot regain its normal tone. This can be a problem for very overweight people who lost a lot of weight.\n\nThis procedure is a major surgery. Be sure you understand the risks and benefits before having it.\n\nAbdominoplasty is not used as an alternative to weight loss.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n* Reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots, or infection\n\nRisks for this surgery are:\n\n* Excessive scarring\n* Loss of skin\n* Nerve damage that can cause pain or numbness in part of your belly\n* Poor healing\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nTell your surgeon or nurse:\n\n* If you could be pregnant\n* What medicines you are taking, even medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\n\nBefore surgery:\n\n* Several days before surgery, you may be asked to temporarily stop taking blood thinners. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and others.\n* Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\n* If you smoke, try to stop.

Many of the signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia result from a severe shortage (deficiency) of fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, E, and K). The signs and symptoms of this condition primarily affect the gastrointestinal system, eyes, nervous system, and blood.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nThe first signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia appear in infancy. They often include:\n\n* Failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive)\n* Diarrhea\n* Fatty, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea)\n\nAs an individual with this condition ages, additional signs and symptoms include:\n\n* Disturbances in nerve function that may lead to poor muscle coordination and difficulty with balance and movement (ataxia)\n* Loss of certain reflexes\n* Impaired speech (dysarthria)\n* Tremors or other involuntary movements (motor tics)\n* Loss of sensation in the extremities (peripheral neuropathy) or muscle weakness\n* Abnormally curved lower back (lordosis), rounded upper back that also curves to the side (kyphoscoliosis), high-arched feet (pes cavus), or inward- and upward-turning foot (clubfoot)\n\nIndividuals with this condition may also develop an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa, in which breakdown of the light-sensitive layer (retina) at the back of the eye can cause vision loss. In individuals with abetalipoproteinemia, the retinitis pigmentosa can result in complete vision loss.\n\n**Complications**\n\nIndividuals with abetalipoproteinemia usually have a low number of red blood cells (anemia) with abnormally star-shaped red blood cells (acanthocytosis) and have difficulty forming blood clots, which can cause abnormal bleeding.

In some cases, a condition called fatty liver develops, which can cause liver damage.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAbetalipoproteinemia is caused by mutations in the MTTP gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called microsomal triglyceride transfer protein. This protein is essential for creating molecules called beta-lipoproteins in the liver and intestine. Beta-lipoproteins transport fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins from the intestine to the bloodstream so these nutrients can be taken up by tissues throughout the body.\n\nMost MTTP gene mutations lead to the production of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein with reduced or absent function and unable to help in the formation of beta-lipoproteins. A lack of beta-lipoproteins causes severely reduced absorption (malabsorption) of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the digestive tract into the bloodstream.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAbetalipoproteinemia is a rare disorder. More than 100 cases have been described worldwide.\n\n---\n\n**Abetalipoproteinemia**\n\nAbetalipoproteinemia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the lack of beta-lipoproteins in the blood. This condition leads to severely reduced absorption of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the digestive tract into the bloodstream.\n\n**Formation of Beta-Lipoproteins**\n\nBeta-lipoproteins are formed in the small intestine through the action of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP). A lack of beta-lipoproteins causes nutritional deficiencies, which lead to health problems in people with abetalipoproteinemia.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Abetalipoproteinaemia\n* Abetalipoproteinemia neuropathy\n* ABL\n* Acanthocytosis\n* Apolipoprotein B deficiency\n* Bassen-Kornzweig disease\n* Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome\n* Betalipoprotein deficiency disease\n* Congenital betalipoprotein deficiency syndrome\n* Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein deficiency disease\n* MTP deficiency\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nPatient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\nClinical Trials:\n\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\n* ABETALIPOPROTEINEMIA; ABL\n\nScientific Articles on PubMed:\n\n* PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n1.

This enzyme plays a crucial role in the formation of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), a type of fat molecule that transports lipids from the liver to other tissues in the body.\n\n\\n\\n* **Inheritance**: Abetalipoproteinemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) are needed to develop the condition. Carriers of the mutation may not have symptoms but can pass the mutated gene to their offspring.\n\n\\n\\n* **Symptoms and Features**: The main features of abetalipoproteinemia include fat malabsorption, which leads to weight loss, diarrhea, and fatty stools. Other symptoms may include muscle weakness, poor growth in children, and an increased risk of infections due to low levels of certain proteins in the blood.\n\n\\n\\n* **Genetic Testing**: Genetic testing can detect mutations in the MTTP gene, which helps diagnose abetalipoproteinemia. Prenatal diagnosis is also possible through genetic testing of amniotic fluid or chorionic villus samples.\n\n\\n\\n* **Management and Treatment**: There is no cure for abetalipoproteinemia, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. This may include a low-fat diet, vitamin supplements, and antibiotics to prevent infections. Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider are essential to monitor the condition's progression and adjust treatment as needed.\n\n\\n\\n* **Prognosis**: With proper management and treatment, individuals with abetalipoproteinemia can lead relatively normal lives. However, they may require ongoing medical care to manage their symptoms and prevent complications.",

    "content": "**Abnormal Hemoglobins Testing**\n\nHemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that moves oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and body tissues.\n\n**What are Hemoglobin Derivatives?**\n\nHemoglobin derivatives are forms of hemoglobin altered by attachment of carbon monoxide or certain drugs. High levels of hemoglobin derivatives prevent adequate transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide and cause illness.\n\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\nThe test is done using a small needle to collect a sample of blood from a vein or an artery. The sample may be collected from a vein or artery in the wrist, groin, or arm.\n\nBefore blood is drawn, your health care provider may test circulation to the hand (if the wrist is the site). After the blood is drawn, pressure applied to the puncture site for a few minutes stops the bleeding.\n\n**How Do I Prepare for the Test?**\n\nNo special preparation is needed. For children, it may help to explain how the test will feel and why it is done. This may make the child feel less nervous.\n\n**What Will the Test Feel Like?**\n\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\n\n**Why is the Test Performed?**\n\nCarboxyhemoglobin is a hemoglobin derivative to which carbon monoxide has attached. High amounts of carboxyhemoglobin (\"carbon monoxide poisoning\") prevent the normal movement of oxygen and carbon dioxide by the blood. Carbon monoxide is released in the exhaust from cars, trucks, small engines, stoves, lanterns, grills, fireplaces, gas ranges, and furnaces. In closed spaces such as homes or garages that are not adequately ventilated, carbon monoxide can build up to dangerous levels.\n\nSulfhemoglobin and methemoglobin are rare hemoglobin derivatives to which oxygen cannot attach. They may occur when you take certain medicines such as dapsone, metoclopramide, nitrates, or sulfonamides.\n\n**What Are Normal Results?**\n\nSome levels of hemoglobin derivatives may be normal:\n\n* Carboxyhemoglobin -- less than 1.5% (but may be as high as 9% in smokers)\n* Methemoglobin -- less than 2%\n* Sulfhemoglobin -- undetectable\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Do Abnormal Results Mean?**\n\nHigh levels of hemoglobin derivatives can lead to major health problems.\n\n* Carboxyhemoglobin:\n\t+ 10% to 20% -- symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning begin to appear\n\t+ 30% -- symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may be severe\n\t+ 50% to 80% -- potentially deadly\n* Methemoglobin:\n\t+ 10% to 25% -- bluish skin color (cyanosis)\n\t+ 35% to 40% -- shortness of breath and headache\n\t+ Over 60% -- lethargy and stupor\n\t+ Over 70% -- potentially deadly\n* Sulfhemoglobin:\n\t+ Values of greater than 10 grams per deciliter (g/dL) or 6.2 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) cause bluish skin color, but do not usually cause harmful effects.\n\n**Related Topics**\n\nBlood Count Tests\nCarbon Monoxide Poisoning\nPoisoning\n\n---\n\n**Abnormal Hemoglobins Testing**\n\nHemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that moves oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and body tissues.\n\n**What are Hemoglobin Derivatives?**\n\nHemoglobin derivatives are forms of hemoglobin altered by attachment of carbon monoxide or certain drugs.

It comes in a tablet and is taken each month at the start of the menstrual period.\n* Surgery, if the cause of the bleeding is a polyp or fibroid\n\nYour provider may prescribe iron supplements if you have anemia.\n\nIf you want to get pregnant, you may be given medicine to stimulate ovulation.\n\nWomen with severe symptoms that don't improve or who have a cancerous or precancerous diagnosis may require other procedures such as:\n\n* Surgical procedure to destroy or remove the lining of the uterus\n* Hysterectomy to remove the uterus\n\n---\n\n**Abnormal Uterine Bleeding**\n\n**What is abnormal uterine bleeding?**\n\nAbnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) refers to vaginal bleeding that occurs outside of the normal menstrual cycle. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including hormonal imbalances, polyps or fibroids in the uterus, and certain medical conditions.\n\n**Causes of abnormal uterine bleeding**\n\nThe causes of AUB are numerous and varied. Some common causes include:\n\n* Hormonal imbalances\n* Polyps or fibroids in the uterus\n* Certain medical conditions, such as thyroid disease or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\n* Use of birth control pills or other hormonal medications\n\n**Symptoms of abnormal uterine bleeding**\n\nThe symptoms of AUB can vary depending on the underlying cause. Some common symptoms include:\n\n* Vaginal bleeding that is heavier or lighter than normal\n* Bleeding that occurs outside of the normal menstrual cycle\n* Cramping or pain in the lower abdomen\n* Bloating or weight gain\n\n**Treatment options for abnormal uterine bleeding**\n\nThe treatment options for AUB will depend on the underlying cause and the severity of the symptoms. Some common treatment options include:\n\n* Hormone therapy to regulate menstrual cycles and reduce bleeding\n* Surgical procedures, such as a dilation and curettage (D&C) or a hysterectomy, to remove polyps or fibroids\n* Medications to manage symptoms and prevent further bleeding\n\n**When to seek medical attention**\n\nIf you are experiencing abnormal uterine bleeding, it is essential to seek medical attention. Your healthcare provider can help determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and develop an effective treatment plan.\n\n**Possible complications of abnormal uterine bleeding**\n\nIf left untreated, AUB can lead to several possible complications, including:\n\n* Infertility (inability to get pregnant)\n* Severe anemia due to a lot of blood loss over time\n* Increased risk for endometrial cancer\n\n**References**\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists website.

    "content": "**Abnormally Dark or Light Skin**\n\nAbnormally dark or light skin is a condition where the skin turns darker or lighter than its usual tone. This can be due to various reasons, including hormonal changes, certain medications, and exposure to the sun.\n\n**Causes of Hyperpigmentation**\n\nHyperpigmentation occurs when there is an excess of melanin in the skin. Some causes include:\n\n*   **Skin Inflammation**: Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation\n*   **Certain Medications**: Minocycline, cancer chemotherapies, and birth control pills\n*   **Hormonal Imbalance**: Addison disease\n*   **Iron Overload**: Hemochromatosis\n*   **Sun Exposure**\n*   **Pregnancy**: Melasma or mask of pregnancy\n*   **Certain Birthmarks**\n*   **Skin Condition**: Acanthosis nigricans\n\n**Causes of Hypopigmentation**\n\nHypopigmentation occurs when there is a lack of melanin in the skin.

    "content": "**AbobotulinumtoxinA Injection**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is AbobotulinumtoxinA Injection?**\n\nAbobotulinumtoxinA injection is a prescription medication used to treat various conditions, including facial wrinkles, eye spasms, and muscle stiffness.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nThis medication is prescribed to treat certain medical conditions, such as facial wrinkles, eye spasms, and muscle stiffness. It works by temporarily paralyzing muscles to relieve symptoms.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had any swallowing problems or breathing problems, such as asthma or emphysema, or any condition that affects your muscles or nerves, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), motor neuropathy, myasthenia gravis, or Lambert-Eaton syndrome. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: loss of strength or muscle weakness all over the body; double or blurred vision; drooping eyelids; difficulty swallowing, breathing, or speaking; or inability to control urination.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nAbobotulinumtoxinA injection may spread from the area of injection and cause symptoms of botulism, including severe or life-threatening difficulty breathing or swallowing. People who develop difficulty swallowing during their treatment with this medication may continue to have this difficulty for several weeks, may need to be fed through a feeding tube, and may breathe food or drink into their lungs.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nYour doctor will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with abobotulinumtoxinA injection and each time you receive treatment. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Brand names**\n\nAbobotulinumtoxinA injection is available under the brand name Botox.\n\n---\n\n**AbobotulinumtoxinA Injection**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nAbobotulinumtoxinA injection is used to relieve the symptoms of cervical dystonia (spasmodic torticollis; uncontrollable tightening of the neck muscles that may cause neck pain and abnormal head positions). It is also used to temporarily smooth frown lines (wrinkles between the eyebrows). AbobotulinumtoxinA injection is used to treat spasticity (muscle stiffness and tightness) of muscles in the arms and legs in adults and children 2 years of age and older.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAbobotulinumtoxinA injection comes as a powder to be mixed with a liquid and injected into affected muscles by a doctor. Your doctor will choose the best place to inject the medication in order to treat your condition. You may receive additional injections of abobotulinumtoxinA every 3 to 4 months, depending on your condition and how long the effects of the treatment last.\n\nIf you are receiving abobotulinumtoxinA injection for cervical dystonia, your doctor will probably start you on a low dose and gradually change your dose according to your response to the medication.\n\nOne brand or type of botulinum toxin cannot be substituted for another.\n\nAbobotulinumtoxinA injection may help control your condition but will not cure it. If you are using abobotulinumtoxinA to treat cervical dystonia, it may take 2 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of abobotulinumtoxinA injection.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nAbobotulinumtoxinA injection is also sometimes used to treat blepharospasm (uncontrollable tightening of the eyelid muscles that may cause blinking, squinting, and abnormal eyelid movements) in adults. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n---\n\n**AbobotulinumtoxinA Injection**\n\n**What is AbobotulinumtoxinA Injection?**\n\nAbobotulinumtoxinA injection is a prescription medication used to treat facial wrinkles, blepharospasm (uncontrollable tightening of the eyelid muscles), and other conditions.\n\n**Special Precautions**\n\nBefore receiving abobotulinumtoxinA injection:\n\n* Tell your doctor if you are allergic to abobotulinumtoxinA, incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin), onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox), prabotulinumtoxinA-xvfs (Jeuveau), rimabotulinumtoxinB (Myobloc), or any other medications.\n* Inform your doctor about all prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking.\n* Be aware that allergy products (such as diphenhydramine, loratadine, fexofenadine, chlorpheniramine, or cetirizine) and cold products may interact with abobotulinumtoxinA.\n\n**Special Precautions**\n\nBefore receiving abobotulinumtoxinA injection:\n\n* Tell your doctor if you have swelling or signs of infection in the area where the medication will be injected.\n* Inform your doctor about any eye or face surgery, side effects from botulinum toxin products, changes in facial appearance, bleeding problems, diabetes, or a slow or irregular heartbeat.\n\n**Special Dietary Instructions**\n\nContinue your normal diet unless your doctor tells you otherwise.\n\n**Side Effects**\n\nAbobotulinumtoxinA injection may cause:\n\n* Pain, bruising, redness, or tenderness at the injection site\n* Headache\n* Dry mouth\n* Bone or muscle pain\n* Fatigue\n* Nausea\n* Depression\n* Difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep\n* Cough, sneezing, fever, nasal congestion, or sore throat\n\nSome side effects can be serious.

The medicine helps remove the fetus and placenta from the woman's womb (uterus). Medication abortion is also called the abortion pill.\n\n**Description**\n\nA medication abortion can be done within 11 weeks of the first day of the woman's last period. A combination of two prescription hormone medicines is most often used to help the body expel the fetus and placenta tissue. Your health care provider may prescribe the medicines for you after doing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history.\n\nMedicines used are mifepristone and misoprostol. Your provider will prescribe the medicines, and you will take them at home. Some providers may require you to take the mifepristone in their office before you leave.\n\nAfter you take the medicine, your body will expel the pregnancy tissue. Most women have moderate to heavy bleeding and cramping for several hours. You may have nausea, diarrhea, and sometimes vomiting from taking misoprostol. Your provider may prescribe medicine for pain and nausea to ease your discomfort during this process.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nReasons a medication abortion might be considered include:\n\n*   You have made a personal decision to not carry the pregnancy.\n*   Your baby has a severe birth defect or genetic problem.\n*   Your pregnancy may be harmful to your health.\n*   The pregnancy resulted after a traumatic event such as rape or incest.\n\nThe decision to end a pregnancy is very personal. To help weigh your choices, you may want to discuss your feelings with a counselor, provider, or a family member or friend.\n\n**Risks**\n\nMedication abortion is very safe and has been used in the United States for more than 20 years. Rare risks of medication abortion include:\n\n*   The medication abortion does not work and the pregnancy does not end\n*   Continued vaginal bleeding\n*   Pregnancy tissue not passing completely from body\n*   Blood clots in the uterus\n*   Infection\n*   Allergic reaction to one of the abortion medicines\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nBefore the procedure, you may have the following tests:\n\n*   Pelvic exam to confirm the pregnancy and estimate how many weeks pregnant you are.\n*   A urine or blood HCG test to confirm that you are pregnant.\n*   A blood test checks your blood type. Based on the test result, you may need a special shot to prevent problems if you get pregnant in the future. The shot is called Rho(D) immune globulin (RhoGAM and other brands).\n*   An ultrasound test to check how many weeks pregnant you are and the location of the fetus in the uterus.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nIt is very important to follow-up with your provider. This is to make sure the process was completed and all the tissue was expelled. The medicine may not work in a very small number of women. If this happens, another dose of the medicine or an abortion procedure may need to be done.\n\nPhysical recovery most often occurs within a few days. It will depend on the stage of the pregnancy. Expect some vaginal bleeding and mild cramping for a few days.\n\nTo relieve discomfort or pain in your abdomen:\n\n*   Apply a heating pad set on low or a hot water bottle filled with warm water on your abdomen to help ease discomfort.\n*   Take over-the-counter painkillers as instructed.\n\nFollow these activity guidelines after your procedure:\n\n*   Rest as needed.\n*   Do not do any vigorous activity for a few days. Light housework is fine.\n*   Avoid sexual intercourse for 2 to 3 weeks.\n*   A normal menstrual period should occur in about 4 to 6 weeks.\n\nYou can get pregnant before your next period.
