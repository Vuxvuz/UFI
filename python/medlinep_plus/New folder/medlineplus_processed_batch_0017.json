Stopping exposure to asbestos is essential.\n*   To ease symptoms, drainage and chest percussion can help remove fluids from the lungs.\n*   Your provider may prescribe aerosol medicines to thin lung fluids.\n*   People with this condition may need to receive oxygen by mask or by a plastic piece that fits into the nostrils. Certain people may need a lung transplant.\n\n---\n\n**Asbestosis**\n\n**What is Asbestosis?**\n\nAsbestosis is a lung disease caused by the inhalation of asbestos fibers. It can take up to 20 years for symptoms to appear after exposure.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe main cause of asbestosis is prolonged exposure to asbestos, often in occupational settings such as construction or manufacturing. Smoking can also increase the risk of developing asbestosis.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCommon symptoms include shortness of breath, coughing, and fatigue. In advanced cases, patients may experience weight loss, blue lips (cyanosis), and difficulty speaking.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for asbestosis, but stopping exposure to asbestos is essential. To ease symptoms, drainage and chest percussion can help remove fluids from the lungs. Your provider may prescribe aerosol medicines to thin lung fluids. People with this condition may need to receive oxygen by mask or by a plastic piece that fits into the nostrils. Certain people may need a lung transplant.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nYou can ease the stress of this illness by joining a lung support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\n\nMore information and support for people with asbestosis and their families can be found at:\n\n* American Lung Association -- www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/asbestosis\n* The Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization -- www.asbestosdiseaseawareness.org/\n* United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration -- www.osha.gov/asbestos\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nOutcome depends on the amount of asbestos you were exposed to and how long you were exposed. People who develop malignant mesothelioma tend to have a poor outcome.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you suspect that you have been exposed to asbestos and you have breathing problems. Having asbestosis makes it easier for you to develop lung infections. Talk to your provider about getting the flu, pneumonia, and other vaccines.\n\nIf you've been diagnosed with asbestosis, call your provider right away if you develop a cough, shortness of breath, fever, or other signs of a lung infection, especially if you think you have the flu. Since your lungs are already damaged, it's very important to have the infection treated right away. This will prevent breathing problems from becoming severe, as well as further damage to your lungs.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nIn people who have been exposed to asbestos for more than 10 years, screening with a chest x-ray every 3 to 5 years may detect asbestos-related diseases early. Stopping cigarette smoking can greatly reduce the risk of asbestos-related lung cancer.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nPulmonary fibrosis - from asbestos exposure; Interstitial pneumonitis - from asbestos exposure\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\nIf you have been diagnosed with asbestosis, follow these instructions:\n\n* Quit smoking to prevent further damage to your lungs\n* Get vaccinated against the flu and pneumonia to reduce the risk of lung infections\n* Contact your provider if you experience any symptoms of a lung infection, such as coughing, shortness of breath, or fever\n\n**Images**\n\nRespiratory system\n\n**References**\n\nGo LHT, Cohen RA.

    "content": "**Ascariasis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nPeople get ascariasis by consuming food or drink that is contaminated with roundworm eggs. Ascariasis is the most common intestinal worm infection. It is related to poor sanitation. People who live in places where human feces (stool) are used as fertilizer are also at risk for this disease.\n\nOnce consumed, the eggs hatch and release immature roundworms called larvae inside the small intestine. Within a few days, the larvae move through the bloodstream to the lungs. They travel up through the large airways of the lungs and are swallowed back into the stomach and small intestine.\n\nAs the larvae move through the lungs they may cause an uncommon form of pneumonia called eosinophilic pneumonia. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell. Once the larvae are back in the small intestine, they mature into adult roundworms. Adult worms live in the small intestine, where they lay eggs that are present in feces. They can live 10 to 24 months.\n\nAn estimated 800 to 900 million people are infected worldwide. Ascariasis occurs in people of all ages, though children are affected more severely than adults.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMost of the time, there are no symptoms. If there are symptoms, they may include:\n\n*   Bloody sputum (mucus coughed up by the lower airways)\n*   Cough, wheezing\n*   Low-grade fever\n*   Passing worms in stool\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Skin rash\n*   Stomach pain\n*   Vomiting or coughing up worms\n*   Worms leaving the body through the nose or mouth\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe infected person may show signs of malnutrition. Tests to diagnose this condition include:\n\n*   Abdominal x-ray or other imaging tests\n*   Blood tests, including complete blood count and eosinophil count\n*   Stool exam to look for worms and worm eggs\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment includes medicines such as albendazole that paralyze or kill intestinal parasitic worms.\n\nIf there is a blockage of the intestine caused by a large number of worms, a procedure called an endoscopy may be used to remove the worms. In rare cases, surgery is needed.\n\nPeople who are treated for roundworms should be checked again in 3 months. This involves examining the stools to check for eggs of the worm. If eggs are present, treatment should be given again.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost people recover from symptoms of the infection, even without treatment. But they may continue to carry the worms in their body.\n\nComplications can be caused by adult worms that move to certain organs, such as the:\n\n*   Appendix\n*   Bile duct\n*   Pancreas\n\nIf the worms multiply, they can block the intestine.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nThese complications may occur:\n\n*   Appendicitis\n*   Blockage in the bile ducts of the liver\n*   Blockage in the intestine\n*   Hole in the gut\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if you have symptoms of ascariasis, particularly if you have traveled to an area where the disease is common. Also contact your provider if you have any of the following:\n\n*   Symptoms get worse\n*   Symptoms do not improve with treatment\n*   New symptoms occur\n\n**Prevention**\n\nImproved sanitation and hygiene in developing countries will reduce the risk in those areas. In places where ascariasis is common, people may be given deworming medicines as a preventive measure.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nIntestinal parasite - ascariasis; Roundworm - ascariasis\n\n---\n\n**Ascariasis**\n\n\\n\\n**Causes**\n\nPeople get ascariasis by consuming food or drink that is contaminated with roundworm eggs.

Acetaminophen should be taken in reduced doses.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (a life-threatening infection of the ascitic fluid)\n* Hepatorenal syndrome (kidney failure)\n* Weight loss and protein malnutrition\n* Mental confusion, change in the level of alertness, or coma (hepatic encephalopathy)\n* Bleeding from the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract\n* Build-up of fluid in the space between your lungs and chest cavity (pleural effusion)\n* Other complications of liver cirrhosis\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf you have ascites, contact your provider right away if you have:\n\n* Fever above 100.5°F (38.05°C), or a fever that does not go away\n* Belly pain\n* Blood in your stool or black, tarry stools\n* Blood in your vomit\n* Bruising or bleeding that occurs easily\n* Build-up of fluid in your belly\n* Swollen legs or ankles\n* Breathing problems\n* Confusion or problems staying awake\n* Yellow color in your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice)\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nPortal hypertension - ascites; Cirrhosis - ascites; Liver failure - ascites; Alcohol use - ascites; End-stage liver disease - ascites; ESLD - ascites; Pancreatitis ascites\n\n**Images**\n\nAscites with ovarian cancer - CT scan\nDigestive system organs\n\n---\n\n**Ascites**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Ascites**\n\nAscites can be caused by various conditions, including:\n\n*   **Cirrhosis**: A condition where the liver is scarred due to chronic inflammation or infection.\n*   **Liver cancer**: Cancer that develops in the liver cells.\n*   **Ovarian cancer**: Cancer that develops in the ovaries.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Ascites**\n\nThe symptoms of ascites may include:\n\n*   **Abdominal swelling**: The accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity can cause the abdomen to become swollen.\n*   **Pain**: The presence of ascites can cause pain in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen.\n*   **Shortness of breath**: In severe cases, the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity can put pressure on the diaphragm, leading to shortness of breath.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis of Ascites**\n\nThe diagnosis of ascites is typically made through a combination of physical examination, imaging studies, and laboratory tests. Imaging studies such as ultrasound or CT scan may be used to visualize the fluid in the abdominal cavity. Laboratory tests may also be performed to determine the cause of the ascites.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment of Ascites**\n\nThe treatment of ascites depends on the underlying cause of the condition. In some cases, ascites may resolve on its own with supportive care. In other cases, more aggressive treatment may be necessary, such as:\n\n*   **Drainage**: The removal of fluid from the abdominal cavity through a procedure called paracentesis.\n*   **Diuretics**: Medications that help the body remove excess fluid.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention of Ascites**\n\nWhile it is not possible to prevent all cases of ascites, there are steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing this condition. These include:\n\n*   **Maintaining a healthy weight**: Being overweight or obese can increase the risk of developing liver disease and ascites.\n*   **Avoiding excessive alcohol consumption**: Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to liver damage and an increased risk of developing ascites.\n*   **Getting regular check-ups**: Regular health check-ups can help identify any underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing ascites.",

People most at risk for ascorbic acid deficiency are those with a limited variety of food in their diet, or who have intestinal malabsorption problems from cancer or kidney disease. Ascorbic acid is also used to prevent and treat scurvy (a disease that causes fatigue, gum swelling, joint pain, and poor wound healing from a lack of vitamin C in the body).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAscorbic acid comes in extended-release (long-acting) capsules and tablets, lozenges, chewable tablets, chewable gels (gummies), and liquid drops to be given by mouth. It usually is taken once a day or as directed by your doctor. Ascorbic acid is available without a prescription, but your doctor may prescribe ascorbic acid to treat certain conditions. Follow the directions on the package or on your product label or doctor's instructions carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ascorbic acid exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than recommended by your doctor.\n\nIt may take up to 4 weeks for symptoms of scurvy to improve.\n\nAscorbic acid supplements are available alone and in combination with other vitamins.\n\n---\n\n**Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C): MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n*   **Other uses for this medicine**\n    *   This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n*   **What special precautions should I follow?**\n    *   Before taking ascorbic acid, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to ascorbic acid, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in ascorbic acid products.

Be careful not to cut the patch.\n*   Remove the patch from the pouch and hold it with the protective liner facing you.\n*   Peel the first piece of liner off one side of the patch. Be careful not to touch the sticky side with your fingers. A second strip of liner should remain stuck to the patch.\n*   Press the patch firmly onto your skin with the sticky side down.\n*   Remove the second strip of protective liner and press the rest of the sticky side of the patch firmly against your skin. Be sure that the patch is pressed flat against the skin with no bumps or folds and the edges are firmly attached to the skin.\n*   Wash your hands with soap and water after you handle the patch.\n\nAfter you have worn the patch for 24 hours, use your fingers to peel the patch off slowly and gently.

    "content": "**Asherman Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\nAsherman syndrome is the formation of scar tissue in the uterine cavity. The problem most often develops after uterine surgery.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAsherman syndrome is a rare condition. In most cases, it occurs in women who have had several dilatation and curettage (D&C) procedures.\n\nA severe pelvic infection unrelated to surgery may also lead to Asherman syndrome.\n\nAdhesions in the uterine cavity can also form after infection with tuberculosis or schistosomiasis. These infections are rare in the United States. Uterine complications related to these infections are even less common.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe adhesions may cause:\n\n* Amenorrhea (lack of menstrual periods)\n* Repeated miscarriages\n* Infertility\n\nHowever, such symptoms could be related to several conditions. They are more likely to indicate Asherman syndrome if they occur suddenly after a D&C or other uterine surgery.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA pelvic exam does not reveal problems in most cases.\n\nTests may include:\n\n* Hysterosalpingography\n* Hysterosonogram\n* Transvaginal ultrasound examination\n* Hysteroscopy\n* Blood tests or other laboratory examinations to detect tuberculosis or schistosomiasis\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment involves surgery to cut and remove the adhesions or scar tissue. This can most often be done with hysteroscopy. This uses small instruments and a camera placed into the uterus through the cervix.\n\nAfter scar tissue is removed, the uterine cavity must be kept open while it heals to prevent adhesions from returning. Your health care provider may place a small balloon inside the uterus for several days. You may also need to take estrogen while the uterine lining heals.\n\nYou may need to take antibiotics if there is an infection.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nThe stress of illness can often be helped by joining a support group. In such groups, members share common experiences and problems.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAsherman syndrome can often be cured with surgery. Sometimes more than one procedure will be necessary.\n\nWomen who are infertile because of Asherman syndrome may be able to have a baby after treatment. Successful pregnancy depends on the severity of Asherman syndrome and the difficulty of the treatment. Other factors that affect fertility and pregnancy may also be involved.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications of hysteroscopic surgery are uncommon. When they occur, they may include bleeding, perforation of the uterus, and pelvic infection.\n\nIn some cases, treatment of Asherman syndrome will not cure infertility.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n* Your menstrual periods do not return after a gynecologic or obstetrical surgery.\n* You cannot get pregnant after 6 to 12 months of trying (your provider may ask you to see a specialist for an infertility evaluation).\n\n**Prevention**\n\nMost cases of Asherman syndrome cannot be predicted or prevented.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nUterine synechiae; Intrauterine adhesions; Infertility - Asherman; Asherman's syndrome\n\n**References**\n\nDolan MS, Hill CC, Valea FA.

    "content": "**Ashwagandha**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is it?**\n\nAshwagandha is an evergreen shrub that grows in Asia and Africa. It is commonly used for stress. There is little evidence for its use as an \"adaptogen.\"\n\nAshwagandha contains chemicals that might help calm the brain, reduce swelling, lower blood pressure, and alter the immune system.\n\nPeople commonly use ashwagandha for anxiety, insomnia, and stress. It is also used for asthma, athletic performance, back pain, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using ashwagandha for COVID-19.\n\nDon't confuse ashwagandha with Physalis alkekengi. Both are known as winter cherry. Also, don't confuse ashwagandha with American ginseng, Panax ginseng, or eleuthero.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How effective is it?**\n\nNatural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\n\nThe effectiveness ratings for ASHWAGANDHA are as follows:\n\n*   **Possibly effective for...**\n    *   Anxiety. Taking ashwagandha by mouth might reduce anxiety.\n    *   A type of persistent anxiety marked by exaggerated worry and tension (generalized anxiety disorder or GAD). Taking ashwagandha by mouth seems to improve anxiety in people with persistent anxiety.\n    *   Insomnia. Taking ashwagandha by mouth seems to improve overall sleep and sleep quality in some people.\n    *   Stress. Taking ashwagandha by mouth seems to help reduce stress in some people. It might also help reduce stress-related weight gain.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Is it safe?**\n\nWhen taken by mouth: Ashwagandha is possibly safe when used for up to 3 months. The long-term safety of ashwagandha is not known. Large doses of ashwagandha might cause stomach upset, diarrhea, and vomiting. Rarely, liver problems, including severe liver failure and a need for liver transplantation, might occur.\n\nWhen applied to the skin: Lotion containing ashwagandha is possibly safe when used for up to 2 months.\n\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\n\n*   Pregnancy: It is likely unsafe to use ashwagandha when pregnant. There is some evidence that ashwagandha might cause miscarriages.\n*   Breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if ashwagandha is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n*   \"Auto-immune diseases\" such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions: Ashwagandha might cause the immune system to become more active, and this could increase the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. If you have one of these conditions, it's best to avoid using ashwagandha.\n*   Liver disease: Ashwagandha might cause liver damage in some people. But it isn't clear how often this occurs. Until more is known, people with liver disease should avoid taking ashwagandha.\n*   Surgery: Ashwagandha may slow down the central nervous system. Healthcare providers worry that anesthesia and other medications during and after surgery might increase this effect. Stop taking ashwagandha at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are there interactions with medications?**\n\nAshwagandha may interact with certain medications, including:\n\n*   Blood thinners: Ashwagandha might decrease the risk of bleeding when taken with blood thinners.\n*   Diabetes medications: Ashwagandha might increase the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) when taken with diabetes medications.\n*   Sedatives: Ashwagandha may slow down the central nervous system, which could increase the effects of sedatives.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?**\n\nAshwagandha may interact with certain herbs and supplements, including:\n\n*   St. John's Wort: Ashwagandha might decrease the risk of bleeding when taken with St. John's Wort.\n*   Ginkgo biloba: Ashwagandha might increase the risk of bleeding when taken with ginkgo biloba.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Are there interactions with foods?**\n\nAshwagandha may interact with certain foods, including:\n\n*   Grapefruit juice: Ashwagandha might decrease the absorption of certain medications when taken with grapefruit juice.\n*   Caffeine: Ashwagandha may slow down the central nervous system, which could increase the effects of caffeine.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nAshwagandha is typically used in the following ways:\n\n*   Capsules or tablets: Ashwagandha is often taken as a capsule or tablet, containing 300-500 mg of ashwagandha extract.\n*   Tea: Ashwagandha tea is made by steeping dried ashwagandha leaves in hot water.\n*   Tincture: Ashwagandha tincture is a liquid extract that can be taken sublingually (under the tongue) or added to food and drinks.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other names**\n\nAshwagandha is also known as:\n\n*   Winter cherry\n*   Indian ginseng\n*   Kaunch beej\n\nNote: The information provided is for informational purposes only and should not be considered as medical advice. Before using ashwagandha, consult with a healthcare professional to discuss potential interactions and contraindications.\n\n---\n\n**Ashwagandha: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 2/3)**\n\n\\n\\n**Interactions with Medications**\n\n*   **Moderate**: Be cautious with this combination.\n    *   **Medications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs)**: Ashwagandha might lower blood sugar levels. Taking ashwagandha along with diabetes medications might cause blood sugar to drop too low. Monitor your blood sugar closely.\n    *   **Medications for high blood pressure (Antihypertensive drugs)**: Ashwagandha might lower blood pressure. Taking ashwagandha along with medications that lower blood pressure might cause blood pressure to go too low. Monitor your blood pressure closely.\n    *   **Medications that can harm the liver (Hepatotoxic drugs)**: Ashwagandha might harm the liver. Some medications can also harm the liver. Taking ashwagandha along with a medication that can harm the liver might increase the risk of liver damage.\n    *   **Medications that decrease the immune system (Immunosuppressants)**: Ashwagandha can increase the activity of the immune system. Some medications, such as those used after a transplant, decrease the activity of the immune system. Taking ashwagandha along with these medications might decrease the effects of these medications.\n    *   **Sedative medications (Benzodiazepines)**: Ashwagandha might cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Some medications, called sedatives, can also cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Taking ashwagandha with sedative medications might cause breathing problems and/or too much sleepiness.\n    *   **Sedative medications (CNS depressants)**: Ashwagandha might cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Some medications, called sedatives, can also cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Taking ashwagandha with sedative medications might cause breathing problems and/or too much sleepiness.\n    *   **Thyroid hormone**: The body naturally produces thyroid hormones. Ashwagandha might increase how much thyroid hormone the body produces. Taking ashwagandha with thyroid hormone pills might cause too much thyroid hormone in the body, and increase the effects and side effects of thyroid hormone.\n\n\\n\\n**Interactions with Herbs and Supplements**\n\n*   **Herbs and supplements that might harm the liver**: Ashwagandha might harm the liver. Taking it with other supplements that can also harm the liver might increase the risk of liver damage. Examples of supplements with this effect include garcinia, greater celandine, green tea extract, kava, and kratom.\n*   **Herbs and supplements that might lower blood pressure**: Ashwagandha might lower blood pressure. Taking it with other supplements that have the same effect might cause blood pressure to drop too much. Examples of supplements with this effect include andrographis, casein peptides, L-arginine, niacin, and stinging nettle.\n*   **Herbs and supplements with sedative properties**: Ashwagandha might cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Taking it along with other supplements with similar effects might cause too much sleepiness and/or slowed breathing in some people. Examples of supplements with this effect include hops, kava, L-tryptophan, melatonin, and valerian.\n\n\\n\\n**Stop taking ashwagandha at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.**\n\n---\n\n**Ashwagandha: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 3/3)**\n\n**Properties**\n\nAshwagandha might cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Taking it along with other supplements with similar effects might cause too much sleepiness and/or slowed breathing in some people. Examples of supplements with this effect include hops, kava, L-tryptophan, melatonin, and valerian.\n\n**Interactions with Foods**\n\nThere are no known interactions with foods.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n\nAshwagandha has most often been used by adults in doses up to 1000 mg daily, for up to 12 weeks. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what dose might be best for a specific condition.\n\n**Other Names**\n\n* Ajagandha\n* Amangura\n* Amukkirag\n* Asan\n* Asana\n* Asgand\n* Asgandh\n* Asgandha\n* Ashagandha\n* Ashvagandha\n* Ashwaganda\n* Ashwanga\n* Asoda\n* Asundha\n* Asvagandha\n* Aswagandha\n* Avarada\n* Ayurvedic Ginseng\n* Cerise d'Hiver\n* Clustered Wintercherry\n* Ghoda Asoda\n* Ginseng Ayurvédique\n* Ginseng Indien\n* Hayahvaya\n* Indian Ginseng\n* Kanaje Hindi\n* Kuthmithi\n* Orovale\n* Peyette\n* Physalis somnifera\n* Samm Al Ferakh\n* Samm Al Rerakh\n* Sogade-Beru\n* Strychnos\n* Turangi-Ghanda\n* Vajigandha\n* Winter Cherry\n* Withania\n* Withania somnifera\n\n**Methodology**\n\nTo learn more about how this article was written, please see the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database methodology.\n\n**References**\n\n1.

    "content": "**Asparagine Synthetase Deficiency**\n\n**Description**\n\nAsparagine synthetase deficiency is a condition that causes neurological problems in affected individuals starting soon after birth. Most people with this condition have an unusually small head size (microcephaly) that worsens over time due to loss (atrophy) of brain tissue. They also have severe developmental delay that affects both mental and motor skills (psychomotor delay). Affected individuals cannot sit, crawl, or walk and are unable to communicate verbally or nonverbally. The few affected children who achieve developmental milestones often lose these skills over time (developmental regression).\n\nMost individuals with asparagine synthetase deficiency have exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia) and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). The muscle problems worsen through childhood and lead to muscle stiffness, uncontrolled movements, and ultimately, paralysis of the arms and legs (spastic quadriplegia). Many affected individuals also have recurrent seizures (epilepsy). Not all affected people experience the same type of seizure. The most common types involve a loss of consciousness, muscle rigidity, and convulsions (tonic-clonic); involuntary muscle twitches (myoclonic); or abnormal muscle contraction (tonic). People with asparagine synthetase deficiency may have an exaggerated startle reaction (hyperekplexia) to unexpected stimuli. Some affected individuals have blindness due to impairment of the area of the brain responsible for processing vision, called the occipital cortex (cortical blindness).\n\nPeople with asparagine synthetase deficiency typically do not survive past childhood.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n* Asparagine synthetase deficiency is a rare condition\n\n**Causes**\n\n* The exact cause of asparagine synthetase deficiency is still unknown, but it is believed to be related to genetic mutations\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n* Asparagine synthetase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that affected individuals must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent)\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* None\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* For more information on asparagine synthetase deficiency, please visit [insert resource]\n\n**References**\n\n* [Insert references]\n\n---\n\n**Asparagine Synthetase Deficiency**\n\n**What is Asparagine Synthetase Deficiency?**\n\nAsparagine synthetase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain and nervous system. It is caused by mutations in the ASNS gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called asparagine synthetase.\n\n**Symptoms of Asparagine Synthetase Deficiency**\n\nPeople with asparagine synthetase deficiency typically experience severe neurological problems starting soon after birth. They may have:\n\n*   Unusually small head size (microcephaly) that worsens over time due to loss of brain tissue\n*   Severe developmental delay affecting both mental and motor skills\n*   Inability to sit, crawl, or walk\n*   Unable to communicate verbally or nonverbally\n*   Exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia)\n*   Weak muscle tone (hypotonia)\n*   Muscle stiffness, uncontrolled movements, and paralysis of the arms and legs (spastic quadriplegia)\n*   Recurrent seizures (epilepsy)\n*   Exaggerated startle reaction to unexpected stimuli\n*   Blindness due to impairment of the area of the brain responsible for processing vision (cortical blindness)\n\n**Causes of Asparagine Synthetase Deficiency**\n\nAsparagine synthetase deficiency is caused by mutations in the ASNS gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called asparagine synthetase, which converts the protein building block (amino acid) aspartic acid to the amino acid asparagine.\n\n**Inheritance Pattern of Asparagine Synthetase Deficiency**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Frequency of Asparagine Synthetase Deficiency**\n\nAsparagine synthetase deficiency is thought to be a rare condition, with more than 20 affected individuals described in the medical literature.\n\n---\n\n**Asparagine Synthetase Deficiency**\n\n**What is Asparagine Synthetase Deficiency?**\n\nAsparagine synthetase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ASNS gene.

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nAST is an enzyme found in high levels in the liver, heart, and muscles. It is also found in lesser amounts in other tissues. An enzyme is a protein that causes a specific chemical change in the body.\n\nInjury to the liver results in release of AST into the blood.\n\nThis test is mainly done along with other tests (such as ALT, ALP, and bilirubin) to diagnose and monitor liver disease.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe normal range is 8 to 33 U/L.\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAn increased AST level is often a sign of liver disease. Liver disease is even more likely when the levels of substances checked by other liver blood tests have also increased.\n\nAn increased AST level may be due to any of the following:\n\n* Scarring of the liver (cirrhosis)\n* Death of liver tissue\n* Heart attack\n* Too much iron in the body (hemochromatosis)\n* Swollen and inflamed liver (hepatitis)\n* Lack of blood flow to the liver (liver ischemia)\n* Liver cancer or tumor\n* Use of drugs that are toxic to the liver, especially alcohol use\n* Mononucleosis (\"mono\")\n* Muscle disease or trauma\n* Swollen and inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis)\n\nAST level may also increase after:\n\n* Burns (deep)\n* Heart procedures\n* Seizures\n* Surgery\n\nPregnancy and exercise may also cause an increased AST level.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.

This condition worsens over time.\n\n**Symptoms in Childhood**\n\nInfants with aspartylglucosaminuria appear healthy at birth, and development is typically normal throughout early childhood. Around the age of 2 or 3, affected children usually begin to have:\n\n* Delayed speech\n* Mild intellectual disability\n* Problems coordinating movements\n\nOther features that develop in childhood include:\n\n* Respiratory infections\n* A protrusion of organs through gaps in muscles (hernia)\n* A growth spurt resulting in a large head size (macrocephaly)\n\n**Progression of Symptoms**\n\nIntellectual disability and movement problems worsen in adolescence. Most people with this disorder lose much of the speech they have learned, and affected adults usually have only a few words in their vocabulary. Adults with aspartylglucosaminuria often have psychological disorders and may develop seizures.\n\n**Additional Features**\n\nPeople with aspartylglucosaminuria may also have:\n\n* Bones that become progressively weak and prone to fracture (osteoporosis)\n* An unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility)\n* Loose skin\n* A characteristic facial appearance, including:\n\t+ Widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism)\n\t+ Small ears\n\t+ Full lips\n\t+ A short and broad nose\n\t+ A square-shaped face\n* Poor oral health, including infections and gum disease (gingivitis)\n\nChildren with this condition may be tall for their age, but lack of a growth spurt in puberty typically causes adults to be short with a small head size (microcephaly). Individuals with aspartylglucosaminuria usually survive into mid-adulthood.\n\n---\n\n**Aspartylglucosaminuria**\n\nAspartylglucosaminuria is a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects mental functioning and movement.

The AGA gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called aspartylglucosaminidase, which helps break down complex chains of sugar molecules attached to certain proteins.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the gene in each cell have variants. The parents of an individual with this condition typically do not show signs and symptoms, but they are carriers of one altered copy of the gene.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nIt is estimated that 1 to 3 individuals are born with aspartylglucosaminuria each year in Finland, where it is more common. The incidence outside of Finland is unknown.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* AGA deficiency\n* Aspartylglucosamidase deficiency\n* Aspartylglucosaminidase deficiency\n* Aspartylglycosaminuria\n* Glycosylasparaginase deficiency\n\n---\n\n**Aspartylglucosaminuria**\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n*   **Genetic Testing Registry:** Aspartylglucosaminuria\n*   **Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center:** Aspartylglucosaminuria\n*   **Patient Support and Advocacy Resources:**\n    *   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   **Clinical Trials:**\n    *   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:**\n    *   ASPARTYLGLUCOSAMINURIA; AGU\n*   **Scientific Articles on PubMed:**\n    *   PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n*   Aronson NN Jr. Aspartylglycosaminuria: biochemistry and molecular biology.

    "content": "**Aspergillosis Precipitin**\n\nAspergillosis precipitin is a laboratory test to detect antibodies in the blood resulting from exposure to the fungus aspergillus.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nA blood sample is needed. The sample is sent to a laboratory where it is examined for precipitin bands that form when aspergillus antibodies are present.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nThere is no special preparation.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nYour health care provider may order this test if you have signs of an aspergillosis infection.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nA normal test result means you do not have aspergillus antibodies. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nA positive result means antibodies to the fungus have been detected. This result means you have been exposed to the fungus at some point, but it does not necessarily mean you have an active infection. False-negative results are possible. For example, invasive aspergillosis often does not produce a positive result, even though aspergillus is present.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nAspergillus immunodiffusion test; Test for precipitating antibodies\n\n---\n\n**Aspergillosis Precipitin**\n\n**Normal Value Ranges**\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories.

The fungus is very common in both indoors and outdoors.\n\n**Who Gets Affected?**\n\nMost people breathe in the spores of the fungus every day without being affected. But some people get the disease. It usually occurs in people with lung diseases or weakened immune systems.\n\n**Types of Aspergillosis**\n\nThere are different kinds of aspergillosis:\n\n*   **Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA)**: Symptoms include wheezing and coughing. ABPA can affect healthy people but it is most common in people with asthma or cystic fibrosis.\n*   **Invasive Aspergillosis**: This kind damages tissues in the body. It usually affects the lungs. Sometimes it can also cause infection in other organs and spread throughout the body. It affects people who have immune system problems, such as people who have had a transplant, are taking high doses of steroids, or getting chemotherapy for some cancers.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nYour doctor might do a variety of tests to make the diagnosis, including:\n\n*   A chest x-ray\n*   CT scan of the lungs\n*   An examination of tissues for signs of the fungus\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment is with antifungal drugs.

If hot asphalt gets on the **skin**, serious injury can occur.\n\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\n\n**Poisonous Ingredient**\n\nThe substances in asphalt that can be harmful are:\n\n*   **Hydrocarbons**\n*   **Industrial glues**\n*   **Industrial solvents**\n*   **Tar**\n\n**Where Found**\n\nAsphalt is found in:\n\n*   Road paving materials\n*   Roofing materials\n*   Tile cements\n\nAsphalt may also be used for other purposes.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nBelow are symptoms of asphalt poisoning in different parts of the body.\n\n*   **EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT**\n    *   Loss of vision\n    *   Severe pain in the throat\n    *   Severe pain or burning in the nose, eyes, ears, lips, or tongue\n*   **HEART AND BLOOD**\n    *   Collapse\n    *   Low blood pressure that develops rapidly (shock)\n*   **LUNGS AND AIRWAYS**\n    *   Breathing difficulty (from breathing in asphalt)\n    *   Throat swelling (which may also cause breathing difficulty)\n*   **SKIN**\n    *   Burns\n    *   Irritation\n    *   Holes (ulcers) in the skin or tissues under the skin\n*   **STOMACH AND INTESTINES**\n    *   Blockage in the intestines\n    *   Blood in the stool\n    *   Burns of the food pipe (esophagus)\n    *   Severe abdominal pain\n    *   Vomiting (may contain blood)\n\n**Home Care**\n\nSeek medical help right away. Do not make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to.\n\nIf the person swallowed asphalt, give them water or milk right away, unless a provider tells you not to. Do not give anything to drink if the person has symptoms that make it hard to swallow. These include vomiting, convulsions, or a decreased level of alertness.\n\n**Before Calling Emergency**\n\nHave this information ready:\n\n*   Person's age, weight, and condition\n*   Name of the product (ingredients, if known)\n*   Time it was swallowed\n*   Amount swallowed\n\n**Poison Control**\n\nYour local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.\n\nThis is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nThe provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated.\n\nThe person may receive:\n\n*   Blood and urine tests\n*   Breathing support, including giving oxygen through a tube through the mouth into the lungs, and a breathing machine (ventilator)\n*   Bronchoscopy -- camera placed down the throat to look for burns in the airways and lungs\n*   Chest x-ray\n*   ECG (heart tracing)\n*   Endoscopy -- camera placed down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and the stomach\n*   Fluids through vein (by IV)\n*   Products to dissolve the asphalt\n*   Medicines to treat symptoms\n*   Surgery to remove burned skin (debridement)\n*   Washing of the skin (irrigation). This may need to be done every few hours for several days.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nHow well someone does depends on how much asphalt they swallowed and how quickly they receive treatment. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery. Hot asphalt cools very quickly and is difficult to get off the skin. Serious burns can easily occur from the extreme heat. Construction workers who work with asphalt should wear protective clothing.\n\nAsphalt is hard to swallow, but it may cause serious damage.\n\nDelayed injury may occur, including a hole forming in the throat, esophagus, or stomach. This can lead to severe bleeding and infection. Surgical procedures may be needed to treat these complications.\n\nIf asphalt gets in the eye, ulcers may develop in the cornea, the clear part of the eye. This can cause blindness.\n\n---\n\n**Asphalt Cement Poisoning**\n\n**What is it?**\nAsphalt cement poisoning occurs when someone swallows asphalt or gets it on their skin.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Loss of vision\n* Severe pain in the throat\n* Severe pain or burning in the nose, eyes, ears, lips, or tongue\n* Collapse\n* Low blood pressure that develops rapidly (shock)\n* Breathing difficulty (from breathing in asphalt)\n* Throat swelling (which may also cause breathing difficulty)\n* Burns\n* Irritation\n* Holes (ulcers) in the skin or tissues under the skin\n* Blockage in the intestines\n* Blood in the stool\n* Burns of the food pipe (esophagus)\n* Severe abdominal pain\n* Vomiting (may contain blood)\n\n**Where is it found?**\nAsphalt is found in:\n\n* Road paving materials\n* Roofing materials\n* Tile cements\n\n**Home Care**\n\n* Seek medical help right away.\n* Do not make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to.\n* If the person swallowed asphalt, give them water or milk right away, unless a provider tells you not to.

    "content": "**Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy**\n\n**Description**\n\nAsphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, also known as Jeune syndrome, is an inherited disorder of bone growth characterized by a narrow chest, short ribs, shortened bones in the arms and legs, short stature, and extra fingers and toes (polydactyly). Additional skeletal abnormalities can include unusually shaped collarbones (clavicles) and pelvic bones, and cone-shaped ends of the long bones in the arms and legs. Many infants with this condition are born with an extremely narrow, bell-shaped chest that can restrict the growth and expansion of the lungs.\n\n**Life Expectancy**\n\nLife-threatening problems with breathing result, and people with asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy may live only into infancy or early childhood. However, in people who survive beyond the first few years, the narrow chest and related breathing problems can improve with age.\n\n**Symptoms and Features**\n\nSome people with asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy are born with less severe skeletal abnormalities and have only mild breathing difficulties, such as rapid breathing or shortness of breath. These individuals may live into adolescence or adulthood. After infancy, people with this condition may develop life-threatening kidney (renal) abnormalities that cause the kidneys to malfunction or fail. Heart defects and a narrowing of the airway (subglottic stenosis) are also possible.\n\nOther, less common features of asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy include:\n\n*   Liver disease\n*   Fluid-filled sacs (cysts) in the pancreas\n*   Dental abnormalities\n*   An eye disease called retinal dystrophy that can lead to vision loss\n\n---\n\n**Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy**\n\n**What is Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy?**\n\nAsphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, also known as Jeune syndrome, is an inherited disorder of bone growth characterized by a narrow chest, short ribs, shortened bones in the arms and legs, short stature, and extra fingers and toes (polydactyly).\n\n**Symptoms and Features**\n\n* Narrow chest\n* Short ribs\n* Shortened bones in the arms and legs\n* Short stature\n* Extra fingers and toes (polydactyly)\n* Unusually shaped collarbones (clavicles) and pelvic bones\n* Cone-shaped ends of the long bones in the arms and legs\n* Life-threatening breathing problems\n* Kidney abnormalities that can cause kidney malfunction or failure\n* Heart defects\n* Narrowing of the airway (subglottic stenosis)\n* Liver disease\n* Fluid-filled sacs (cysts) in the pancreas\n* Dental abnormalities\n* Eye disease called retinal dystrophy that can lead to vision loss\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAsphyxiating thoracic dystrophy affects an estimated 1 in 100,000 to 130,000 people.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in at least 11 genes have been found to cause asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy. Genetic changes in the IFT80 gene were the first to be associated with this condition. Later, researchers discovered that mutations in another gene, DYNC2H1, account for up to half of all cases.\n\n**Genetic Basis**\n\nThe genes associated with asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy provide instructions for making proteins that are found in cell structures called cilia. Cilia are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. The proteins are involved in a process called intraflagellar transport (IFT), by which materials are carried to and from the tips of cilia.\n\n**Impact on Cells**\n\nMutations in the genes associated with asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy impair IFT, which disrupts the normal assembly or function of cilia. As a result, cilia are missing or abnormal in many different kinds of cells.\n\n**Relationship to Other Disorders**\n\nAsphyxiating thoracic dystrophy is part of a group of disorders known as skeletal ciliopathies or ciliary chondrodysplasias, all of which are caused by problems with cilia and involve bone abnormalities.\n\n---\n\n**Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy**\n\n**What is Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy?**\n\nAsphyxiating thoracic dystrophy is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the lungs, chest, and spine. It is part of a group of disorders known as skeletal ciliopathies or ciliary chondrodysplasias, all of which are caused by problems with cilia and involve bone abnormalities.\n\n**Classification**\n\nSeveral of these disorders, including asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, are sometimes classified more specifically as short rib-polydactyly syndromes (SRPSs) based on their signs and symptoms. Some researchers believe that SRPSs would be more accurately described as a spectrum with a range of features rather than as separate disorders.\n\n**Genetic Causes**\n\nMutations in at least 11 genes have been found to cause asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy. Genetic changes in the IFT80 gene were the first to be associated with this condition. Later, researchers discovered that mutations in another gene, DYNC2H1, account for up to half of all cases. Mutations in other genes each cause a small percentage of cases. In total, about 70 percent of people with asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy have mutations in one of the known genes.\n\n**Proteins and Cilia**\n\nThe genes associated with asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy provide instructions for making proteins that are found in cell structures called cilia. Cilia are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. The proteins are involved in a process called intraflagellar transport (IFT), by which materials are carried to and from the tips of cilia.\n\n**Signaling Pathways**\n\nCilia play central roles in many different chemical signaling pathways, including a series of reactions called the Sonic Hedgehog pathway. These pathways are important for the growth and division (proliferation) and maturation (differentiation) of cells. In particular, Sonic Hedgehog appears to be essential for the proliferation and differentiation of cells that ultimately give rise to cartilage and bone.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nAsphyxiating thoracic chondrodystrophy\nAsphyxiating thoracic dysplasia\nATD\nChondroectodermal dysplasia-like syndrome\nInfantile thoracic dystrophy\nJeune syndrome\nJeune thoracic dysplasia\nJeune thoracic dystrophy\nThoracic asphyxiant dystrophy\nThoracic-pelvic-phalangeal dystrophy\n\n---\n\n**Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy**\n\n**What is Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy?**\n\nAsphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the lungs, ribcage, and spine. It is characterized by a narrow chest cavity, which can lead to respiratory problems and other complications.\n\n**Types of Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy**\n\nThere are several types of ATD, including:\n\n* **Jeune syndrome**: This is the most common type of ATD, accounting for about 70% of cases. It is characterized by a narrow chest cavity, polydactyly (extra fingers or toes), and other skeletal abnormalities.\n* **Short-rib thoracic dystrophy with or without polydactyly**: This type of ATD is similar to Jeune syndrome but may not involve polydactyly.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nATD is caused by genetic mutations that affect the development of the lungs, ribcage, and spine. The exact cause of the disorder is still unknown, but it is believed to be related to errors in DNA replication during fetal development.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of ATD can vary depending on the type and severity of the disorder. They may include:\n\n* **Respiratory problems**: Difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, or other signs of respiratory distress.\n* **Skeletal abnormalities**: Polydactyly, clubfoot, or other skeletal deformities.\n* **Developmental delays**: Delays in physical development, such as delayed growth or developmental milestones.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing ATD can be challenging, as the symptoms may resemble those of other genetic disorders. A diagnosis is typically made through a combination of:\n\n* **Genetic testing**: Analysis of DNA samples to identify mutations associated with ATD.\n* **Imaging studies**: X-rays, CT scans, or MRI scans to evaluate the development of the lungs, ribcage, and spine.\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for ATD, but treatment and management can help alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. These may include:\n\n* **Respiratory therapy**: Oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, or other interventions to support breathing.\n* **Surgical interventions**: Surgery to correct skeletal deformities or other complications.\n* **Palliative care**: Supportive care to manage pain, discomfort, and other symptoms.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with ATD varies depending on the type and severity of the disorder. In general, the prognosis is poor, especially if respiratory problems are severe. With proper treatment and management, however, many individuals with ATD can lead active and fulfilling lives.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* **Bone diseases**: Disorders that affect the development or function of bones.\n* **Dwarfism**: A condition characterized by short stature due to genetic or hormonal abnormalities.\n* **Genetic disorders**: Conditions caused by errors in DNA replication or other genetic mutations.\n* **Polydactyly**: A condition characterized by extra fingers or toes.\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n* **What is the prognosis of a genetic condition?**\n* **How can gene variants affect health and development?**\n* **What does it mean if a disorder seems to run in my family?**\n* **What are the different ways a genetic condition can be inherited?**\n* **How are genetic conditions treated or managed?**\n\nNote: The above information is for educational purposes only and should not be considered as medical advice.

    "content": "**Aspirin Rectal**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nAspirin rectal is used to reduce fever and relieve mild to moderate pain from headaches, menstrual periods, arthritis, toothaches, and muscle aches.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nAspirin rectal comes as a suppository to use rectally. Follow the directions on the package or prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\n*   Ask a doctor before giving aspirin to your child or teenager.\n*   Many aspirin products come in combination with other medications such as those to treat cough and cold symptoms. Check product labels carefully before using two or more products at the same time.\n*   Stop using aspirin rectal and call your doctor if your fever lasts longer than 3 days, if your pain lasts longer than 10 days, or if the part of your body that was painful becomes red or swollen.\n\n**To insert an aspirin suppository into the rectum:**\n\n1.  Wash your hands.\n2.  Remove the wrapper.\n3.  Lie down on your left side and raise your right knee to your chest (a left-handed person should lie on the right side and raise the left knee).\n4.  Using your finger, insert the suppository into the rectum, about 1/2 to 1 inch in infants and children and 1 inch in adults.\n5.  Hold it in place for a few moments.\n6.  Remain lying down for 5 minutes to prevent the suppository from coming out.\n7.  Wash your hands thoroughly and resume your normal activities.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\n*   Aspirin may cause Reye's syndrome (a serious condition in which fat builds up on the brain, liver, and other body organs) in children and teenagers, especially if they have a virus such as chicken pox or the flu.\n*   Check product labels carefully before using two or more products at the same time. These products may contain the same active ingredient(s) and taking or using them together could cause you to receive an overdose.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you miss a dose of aspirin rectal, take it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, wait until then to take the medicine. Do not take extra doses.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nAspirin rectal may cause stomach upset, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.

    "content": "**Aspirin Overdose**\n\nAspirin overdose occurs when someone accidentally or intentionally takes more than the recommended amount of aspirin. This can happen in two ways:\n\n*   **Acute Overdose**: Taking a very large dose of aspirin at one time.\n*   **Chronic Overdose**: A normal daily dose of aspirin building up in the body over time and causing symptoms, often seen in older people during hot weather due to dehydration or kidney issues.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nAirways and lungs:\n\n*   Rapid breathing\n*   Slow, labored breathing\n*   Wheezing\n\nEyes, ears, nose, and throat:\n\n*   Ringing in the ears\n*   Blurred vision\n\nNervous system:\n\n*   Agitation, confusion, incoherence (not understandable)\n*   Collapse\n*   Coma (lack of responsiveness)\n*   Seizures\n*   Drowsiness\n*   Headache (severe)\n*   Unsteadiness, problems moving\n\nSkin:\n\n*   Rash\n\nStomach and intestines:\n\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Heartburn\n*   Nausea, vomiting (sometimes bloody)\n*   Stomach pain (possible bleeding in the stomach and intestines)\n\nSymptoms of chronic overdose may include:\n\n*   Fatigue\n*   Slight fever\n*   Confusion\n*   Collapse\n*   Rapid heart beat\n*   Uncontrollable rapid breathing\n\n**Before Calling Emergency**\n\nThe following information is helpful for emergency assistance:\n\n*   Person's age, weight, and condition\n*   Name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known)\n*   Time it was swallowed\n*   Amount swallowed\n\nHowever, DO NOT delay calling for help if this information is not immediately available.\n\n**Poison Control**\n\nYour local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning, who will give you further instructions.\n\n---\n\n**Aspirin Overdose**\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\n*   The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.\n*   Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive:\n    *   Activated charcoal\n    *   Airway support, including oxygen, breathing tube through the mouth (intubation), and ventilator (breathing machine)\n    *   Blood and urine tests including a blood salicylate level\n    *   Chest x-ray\n    *   ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)\n    *   Fluids through the vein (intravenous or IV)\n    *   Laxative\n    *   Medicines to treat symptoms\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\n*   A toxic dose of aspirin is 200 to 300 mg/kg (milligrams per kilogram of body weight), and ingestion of 500 mg/kg is potentially lethal.\n*   In chronic overdose a lower level of aspirin in the body can result in serious illness. Much lower levels can affect children.\n\n**How Well You Do Depends**\n\n*   On how much aspirin your body has absorbed and how much is flowing through your blood.\n*   If you take a large amount of aspirin but come quickly to the emergency room, treatments may help keep your blood levels of aspirin very low.\n\n---\n\n**Aspirin Overdose**\n\n**What to Do If You Suspect an Aspirin Overdose**\n\nIf you suspect someone has taken too much aspirin, call your local poison control center or the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This is a free and confidential service that will give you further instructions.\n\n**What to Expect at the Emergency Room**\n\nWhen you arrive at the emergency room, the health care provider will:\n\n* Measure and monitor your vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.\n* Treat your symptoms as appropriate. You may receive:\n\t+ Activated charcoal\n\t+ Airway support, including oxygen, breathing tube through the mouth (intubation), and ventilator (breathing machine)\n\t+ Blood and urine tests, including a blood salicylate level\n\t+ Chest x-ray\n\t+ ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)\n\t+ Fluids through the vein (intravenous or IV)\n\t+ Laxative\n\t+ Medicines to treat symptoms\n* Other medicines may be given through a vein, including potassium salt and sodium bicarbonate, which helps the body remove aspirin that has already been absorbed.\n* If these treatments do not work or the overdose is extremely severe, hemodialysis (kidney machine) may be needed to reverse the condition.\n* In rare cases, a breathing machine may be needed. Many poisoning experts think this causes more harm than good, so it is only used as a very last resort.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nA toxic dose of aspirin is 200 to 300 mg/kg (milligrams per kilogram of body weight), and ingestion of 500 mg/kg is potentially lethal. In chronic overdose, a lower level of aspirin in the body can result in serious illness. Much lower levels can affect children.\n\nIf treatment is delayed or the overdose is large enough, symptoms will continue to get worse. Breathing becomes extremely fast or may stop. Seizures, high fevers, or death may occur.\n\nHow well you do depends greatly on how much aspirin your body has absorbed and how much is flowing through your blood. If you take a large amount of aspirin but come quickly to the emergency room, treatments may help keep your blood levels of aspirin very low. If you do not get to the emergency room fast enough, the level of aspirin in your blood can become dangerously high.\n\n---\n\n**Aspirin Overdose**\n\n**What is an aspirin overdose?**\n\nAn aspirin overdose occurs when someone takes too much aspirin, causing the amount of salicylate in their body to become dangerously high.\n\n**References**\n\n* Aronson JK.

    "content": "**Aspirin: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nPrescription aspirin is used to relieve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (arthritis caused by swelling of the lining of the joints), osteoarthritis (arthritis caused by breakdown of the lining of the joints), systemic lupus erythematosus (condition in which the immune system attacks the joints and organs and causes pain and swelling) and certain other rheumatologic conditions (conditions in which the immune system attacks parts of the body). Nonprescription aspirin is used to reduce fever and to relieve mild to moderate pain from headaches, menstrual periods, arthritis, toothaches, and muscle aches. Nonprescription aspirin is also used to prevent heart attacks in people who have had a heart attack in the past or who have angina (chest pain that occurs when the heart does not get enough oxygen). Nonprescription aspirin is also used to reduce the risk of death in people who are experiencing or who have recently experienced a heart attack. Nonprescription aspirin is also used to prevent ischemic strokes (strokes that occur when a blood clot blocks the flow of blood to the brain) or mini-strokes (strokes that occur when the flow of blood to the brain is blocked for a short time) in people who have had this type of stroke or mini-stroke in the past. Aspirin will not prevent hemorrhagic strokes (strokes caused by bleeding in the brain). Aspirin is in a group of medications called salicylates. It works by stopping the production of certain natural substances that cause fever, pain, swelling, and blood clots.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nPrescription aspirin comes as an extended-release (long-acting) tablet. Nonprescription aspirin comes as a regular tablet, a delayed-release (releases the medication in the intestine to prevent damage to the stomach) tablet, a chewable tablet, powder, and a gum to take by mouth. Prescription aspirin is usually taken two or more times a day. Nonprescription aspirin is usually taken once a day to lower the risk of a heart attack or stroke. Nonprescription aspirin is usually taken every 4 to 6 hours as needed to treat fever or pain. Follow the directions on the package or prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take aspirin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than directed by the package label or prescribed by your doctor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nSwallow the extended-release tablets whole with a full glass of water. Do not break, crush, or chew them.\n\nSwallow the delayed-release tablets with a full glass of water.\n\nChewable aspirin tablets may be chewed, crushed, or swallowed whole. Drink a full glass of water, immediately after taking these tablets.\n\nAsk a doctor before you give aspirin to your child or teenager. Aspirin may cause Reye's syndrome (a serious condition in which fat builds up on the brain, liver, and other body organs) in children and teenagers, especially if they have a virus such as chicken pox or the flu.\n\nIf you have had oral surgery or surgery to remove your tonsils in the last 7 days, talk to your doctor about which types of aspirin are safe for you.\n\n---\n\n**Aspirin: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nPrescription aspirin comes as an extended-release (long-acting) tablet.

Do not take delayed-release tablets for fever or pain that must be relieved quickly.\n\nStop taking aspirin and call your doctor if your fever lasts longer than 3 days, if your pain lasts longer than 10 days, or if the part of your body that was painful becomes red or swollen. You may have a condition that must be treated by a doctor.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nAspirin is also sometimes used to treat rheumatic fever (a serious condition that may develop after a strep throat infection and may cause swelling of the heart valves) and Kawasaki disease (an illness that may cause heart problems in children). Aspirin is also sometimes used to lower the risk of blood clots in patients who have artificial heart valves or certain other heart conditions and to prevent certain complications of pregnancy.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking aspirin, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to aspirin, other medications for pain or fever, tartrazine dye, or any other medications. Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.\n\nBe sure to mention any of the following: acetazolamide (Diamox); angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as benazepril (Lotensin), captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec), fosinopril (Monopril), lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), moexipril (Univasc), perindopril, (Aceon), quinapril (Accupril), ramipril (Altace), and trandolapril (Mavik); anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin) and heparin; beta blockers such as atenolol (Tenormin), labetalol (Normodyne), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol XL), nadolol (Corgard), and propranolol (Inderal); diuretics ('water pills'); medications for diabetes or arthritis; medications for gout such as probenecid and sulfinpyrazone (Anturane); methotrexate (Trexall); other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn); phenytoin (Dilantin); and valproic acid (Depakene, Depakote). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you more carefully for side effects.\n\nIf you are taking aspirin on a regular basis to prevent heart attack or stroke, do not take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) to treat pain or fever without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably tell you to allow some time to pass between taking your daily dose of aspirin and taking a dose of ibuprofen.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have ever had asthma, frequent stuffed or runny nose, or nasal polyps (growths on the linings of the nose). If you have these conditions, there is a risk that you will have an allergic reaction to aspirin.\n\n---\n\n**Aspirin: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Special Precautions for Aspirin**\n\n*   If you have asthma, frequent stuffed or runny nose, or nasal polyps, your doctor may tell you not to take aspirin due to the risk of an allergic reaction.\n*   Inform your doctor if you often experience heartburn, upset stomach, or stomach pain, as well as any history of ulcers, anemia, bleeding problems, or kidney or liver disease.\n*   If you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breast-feeding, consult with your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking aspirin. Low-dose aspirin (81-mg) may be taken during pregnancy, but higher doses can harm the fetus.\n\n**Interactions with Other Medications**\n\n*   Inform your doctor about all prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.\n*   Certain medications, such as ACE inhibitors, anticoagulants, beta blockers, diuretics, and NSAIDs, may interact with aspirin. Your doctor may need to adjust your medication dosages or monitor you more closely for side effects.\n\n**Special Dietary Instructions**\n\n*   Unless instructed otherwise by your doctor, continue your normal diet while taking aspirin.\n\n**Missing a Dose**\n\n*   If you miss a dose of aspirin and are taking it on a regular basis, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**Side Effects of Aspirin**\n\n*   Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, and heartburn.\n*   Serious side effects may include:\n    *   Hives\n    *   Rash\n    *   Swelling of the eyes, face, lips, tongue, or throat\n    *   Wheezing or difficulty breathing\n    *   Hoarseness\n    *   Fast heartbeat\n    *   Fast breathing\n    *   Cold, clammy skin\n    *   Ringing in the ears\n    *   Loss of hearing\n    *   Bloody vomit\n    *   Vomit that looks like coffee grounds\n    *   Bright red blood in stools\n    *   Black or tarry stools\n\n**Reporting Adverse Events**\n\n*   If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may report it to the FDA's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).\n\n---\n\n**Aspirin: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 4/5)**\n\n\\n\\n* **Possible Side Effects: **\n\t+ e coffee grounds\n\t+ bright red blood in stools\n\t+ black or tarry stools\n\nIf you experience any unusual problems while taking this medication, call your doctor.\n\nIn case of a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the FDA's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).\n\n\\n\\n* **Storage and Disposal: **\nKeep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children.

    "content": "**Assisted Living**\n\nAssisted living is housing and services for people who need some help with daily care. They may need help with things like dressing, bathing, taking their medicines, and cleaning. But they do not need the medical care that a nursing home provides. Assisted living allows the residents to live more independently.\n\n**What is Assisted Living?**\n\nAssisted living facilities sometimes have other names, such as adult care facilities or residential care facilities. They vary in size, with as few as 25 residents up to 120 residents or more. The residents usually live in their own apartments or rooms and share common areas.\n\n**Levels of Care**\n\nThe facilities usually offer a few different levels of care. Residents pay more for the higher levels of care. The types of services they offer may be different from state to state. The services may include:\n\n* Up to three meals a day\n* Assistance with personal care, such as bathing, dressing, eating, getting in and out of bed or chairs, moving around, and using the bathroom\n* Help with medicines\n* Housekeeping\n* Laundry\n* 24-hour supervision, security, and on-site staff\n* Social and recreational activities\n* Transportation\n\n**Who Lives in Assisted Living?**\n\nThe residents are usually older adults, including those with Alzheimer's or other types of dementia.

    "content": "**Assisted Reproductive Technology**\n\nAssisted reproductive technology (ART) is used to treat infertility. It includes fertility treatments that handle both eggs and sperm.\n\n**How ART Works**\n\nART works by removing eggs from the ovaries. The eggs are then mixed with sperm to make embryos. The embryos are then put back in the parent's body. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the most common and effective type of ART.\n\n**Types of ART Procedures**\n\nART procedures sometimes use donor eggs, donor sperm, or previously frozen embryos. It may also involve a surrogate or gestational carrier. A surrogate becomes pregnant with sperm from one partner of the couple. A gestational carrier becomes pregnant with an egg from one partner and sperm from the other partner.\n\n**Complications of ART**\n\nThe most common complication of ART is a multiple pregnancy. It can be prevented or minimized by limiting the number of embryos that are put into the parent's body.\n\n**Learn More**\n\n* Assisted Reproductive Technologies (American Society for Reproductive Medicine)\n* Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART)  (Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development)\n* Also in Spanish\n* Counseling Issues to Discuss with Gay Men and Lesbians Seeking Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) (American Society for Reproductive Medicine) - PDF\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n* ClinicalTrials.gov: Fertilization in Vitro  (National Institutes of Health)\n* ClinicalTrials.gov: Reproductive Techniques, Assisted  (National Institutes of Health)\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\n* References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\n\t+ Article: Two dynamical models for male infertility and their stability and sensitivity... \n\t+ Article: The relationship between insulin resistance and recurrent pregnancy loss in assisted... \n\t+ Article: Effect of human papillomavirus infection on semen quality and assisted reproductive...\n\n---\n\n**Assisted Reproductive Technology | IVF**\n\n\\n\\n* **The relationship between insulin resistance and recurrent pregnancy loss in assisted reproduction**: Research has shown a link between insulin resistance and recurrent pregnancy loss in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART).

    "content": "**Assisted Delivery with Forceps**\n\nIn an assisted vaginal delivery, the doctor will use special tools called forceps to help move the baby through the birth canal. \n\nForceps look like 2 large salad spoons. The doctor uses them to guide the baby's head out of the birth canal. The mother will push the baby the rest of the way out.\n\nAnother technique your doctor may use to deliver the baby is called vacuum-assisted delivery.\n\n**When is a Forceps Delivery Needed?**\n\nEven after your cervix is fully dilated (open) and you have been pushing, you may still need help getting the baby out. Reasons include:\n\n* After pushing for several hours, the baby may be close to coming out, but needs help to get through the last part of the birth canal.\n* You may be too tired to push any longer.\n* A medical problem may make it risky for you to push.\n* The baby may be showing signs of stress and need to come out faster than you can push it out on your own\n\nBefore forceps can be used, your baby needs to be far enough down the birth canal. The baby's head and face must also be in the right position. Your doctor will check carefully to make sure it is safe to use forceps.\n\nMost women will not need forceps to help them deliver. You may feel tired and tempted to ask for a little help. But if there is not a true need for assisted delivery, it is safer for you and your baby to deliver on your own.\n\n**What Will Happen to me During a Forceps-assisted Vaginal Delivery?**\n\nYou will be given medicine to block pain. This may be an epidural block or a numbing medicine placed in the vagina.\n\nThe forceps will be carefully placed on the baby's head. Then, during a contraction, you will be asked to push again.

After delivery, you can hold your baby on your tummy if they are doing well.\n\nIf the forceps do not help move your baby, you may need to have a cesarean birth (C-section).\n\n**What are the Risks?**\n\nMost forceps-assisted vaginal births are safe when they are done correctly by an experienced doctor. They may decrease the need for a C-section.\n\nHowever, there are some risks with forceps delivery.\n\nRisks for the mother are:\n\n* More severe tears to the vagina which may require prolonged healing time and (rarely) surgery to correct\n* Problems with urinating or moving your bowels after delivery\n\nRisks for the baby are:\n\n* Bumps, bruises, or marks on the baby's head or face. They will heal in a few days or weeks.\n* The head may swell or be cone-shaped. This may not be due to a forceps delivery, but due to a prolonged labor. Swelling most often subsides during the first month of life.\n* The baby's nerves may be injured by pressure from the forceps. The baby's facial muscles may droop if the nerves are injured, but they will go back to normal when the nerves heal.\n* The baby may be cut from the forceps and bleed. This rarely happens.\n* There may be bleeding inside the baby's head. This is more serious, but very rare.\n\nMost of these risks are not severe.

    "content": "**Asthma - Child - Discharge**\n\nYour child has asthma, which causes the airways of the lungs to swell and narrow. Now that your child is going home from the hospital, follow your health care provider's instructions on how to care for your child. Use the information below as a reminder.\n\n**When You're in the Hospital**\n\nIn the hospital, your provider helped your child breathe better. This likely involved giving oxygen through a mask and medicines to open the lung airways.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nYour child will probably still have asthma symptoms after leaving the hospital. These symptoms include:\n\n* Wheezing and coughing that may last up to 5 days\n* Sleeping and eating that may take up to a week to return to normal\n\nYou may need to take time off work to care for your child.\n\n**Take Charge of Your Child's Asthma at Home**\n\nMake sure you know the asthma symptoms to watch out for in your child. You should know how to take your child's peak flow reading and understand what it means.\n\n* Know your child's personal best peak flow reading.\n* Know your child's peak flow reading that tells you if their asthma is getting worse.\n* Know your child's peak flow reading that means you need to contact your child's provider.\n\nKeep the phone number (or other contact information) of your child's provider with you.\n\n**Triggers**\n\nTriggers may make asthma symptoms worse. Know which triggers make your child's asthma worse and what to do when this happens. Common triggers include:\n\n* Pets\n* Smells from chemicals and cleaners\n* Grass and weeds\n* Smoke\n* Dust\n* Cockroaches\n* Rooms that are moldy or damp\n\nKnow how to prevent or treat asthma symptoms that arise when your child is active. These things might also trigger your child's asthma:\n\n* Cold or dry air.\n* Smoky or polluted air.\n* Grass that has just been mowed.\n* Starting and stopping an activity too fast. Try to make sure your child warms up before being very active and cools down after.\n\n**Medicines**\n\nUnderstand your child's asthma medicines and how they should be taken. These include:\n\n* Asthma control medicines that your child takes every day\n* Quick-relief asthma medicines when your child has symptoms\n\n**Keep Smoking Away From Your Child**\n\nNo one should smoke in your house. This includes you, your visitors, your child's babysitters, and anyone else who comes to your house.\n\nSmokers should smoke outside and wear a coat. The coat will keep smoke particles from sticking to clothes, so it should be left outside or away from the child.\n\nAsk people who work at your child's day care, preschool, school, and anyone else who takes care of your child, if they smoke. If they do, make sure they smoke away from your child.\n\n**School and Asthma**\n\nChildren with asthma may need a lot of support at school.

They can be divided into two main categories: quick-relief drugs and control drugs.\n\n*   **Quick-Relief Drugs**: These medications provide rapid relief from asthma symptoms, such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. Examples include bronchodilators like albuterol (Ventolin) and ipratropium bromide (Atrovent). They are typically used during an asthma attack or when symptoms worsen.\n*   **Control Drugs**: These medications help prevent asthma symptoms from occurring in the first place. They can be further divided into two subcategories:\n    *   **Anti-inflammatory drugs**: These medications reduce inflammation in the airways, which is a hallmark of asthma. Examples include corticosteroids like fluticasone (Flovent) and budesonide (Pulmicort).\n    *   **Bronchodilators**: These medications help relax the muscles around the airways, making it easier to breathe. Examples include long-acting beta agonists (LABAs) like salmeterol (Serevent) and formoterol (Foradil).\n\nControl drugs are typically used on a daily basis to prevent asthma symptoms from occurring. They can be administered through an inhaler or nebulizer.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Drazen JM, Bel EH. Asthma. In: Goldman L, Cooney KA, eds. Goldman-Cecil Medicine. 27th ed.

The correct answer is use your quick-relief drugs just before exercising. Swimming is a good sport for people with exercise-induced asthma. The warm, moist air helps keep asthma symptoms away. Football, baseball, and other sports with breaks in the action are less likely to trigger asthma symptoms.\n\nAsthma action plans should include: **a plan for taking asthma medicines when your condition is stable**, a list of asthma triggers and how to avoid them, or how to tell when your asthma gets worse, and when to call your doctor or nurse? The correct answer is all of the above. An asthma action plan is an important part of treatment for anyone with asthma. If you don't already have one, talk with your doctor about creating a personal asthma action plan.\n\nWhich of these asthma symptoms is an emergency: **bluish lips and face**, severe drowsiness or confusion during an asthma attack, extreme difficulty breathing, rapid pulse, or severe anxiety caused by shortness of breath? The correct answer is all of the above. Asthma attacks can be dangerous if a person's airways become severely blocked. If you notice any of these symptoms, call 911. Treatment might include oxygen, breathing assistance, and medicines given through a vein (IV).\n\nPeople with asthma can lead normal, active lives: **True or False?** The correct answer is true. Asthma can be scary, but it doesn't have to control you. By getting the right medical treatment, working closely with your doctor, and avoiding your asthma triggers, you can manage your condition and enjoy a full life.\n\n**Related MedlinePlus Health Topics**\n\n*   Asthma",

    "content": "**Asthma in Children**\n\n**What is Asthma?**\n\nAsthma is a chronic (long-term) lung disease that affects your airways, the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. When you have asthma, your airways can become inflamed and narrowed, causing wheezing, coughing, and tightness in your chest.\n\n**How Does Asthma Affect Children?**\n\nAsthma often starts during childhood, usually before age 5. Many children have asthma - it is the most common chronic disease of childhood. It can cause children to miss school and end up in the hospital. But treatments can help manage asthma.\n\n**What Causes Asthma in Children?**\n\nThe exact cause of asthma is unknown. Genetics and environment likely play a role in which children get asthma.\n\n**Asthma Triggers**\n\nAn asthma attack can happen when your child is exposed to an asthma trigger. An asthma trigger is something that can set off or worsen asthma symptoms. Different triggers can cause different types of asthma:\n\n*   Allergic asthma: caused by allergens such as dust mites, mold, pets, pollen from grass, trees, and weeds, waste from pests such as cockroaches and mice\n*   Nonallergic asthma: caused by triggers that are not allergens, such as breathing in cold air, certain medicines, household chemicals, infections such as colds and the flu, outdoor air pollution, tobacco smoke\n*   Exercise-induced asthma: happens during physical exercise, especially when the air is dry\n\n**Which Children Are at Risk for Asthma?**\n\nCertain factors raise the risk of asthma in children:\n\n*   Being exposed to secondhand smoke when their mother is pregnant with them or when they are small children\n*   Genetics and family history. Children are more likely to have asthma if one of their parents has it, especially if it's the mother.\n*   Race or ethnicity. Black and African Americans and Puerto Ricans are at higher risk of asthma than people of other races or ethnicities.\n*   Having other diseases or conditions such as obesity and allergies\n*   Often having viral respiratory infections as young children\n*   Sex. In children, asthma is more common in boys. In teens, it is more common in girls.\n\n**What Are the Symptoms of Asthma in Children?**\n\nThe symptoms of asthma in children include:\n\n*   Chest tightness\n*   Coughing, especially at night or early morning\n*   Breathing problems, such as shortness of breath, rapid breathing, or gasping for air\n*   Feeling tired\n*   Dark circles under the eyes\n*   Being irritable\n*   Wheezing, which causes a whistling sound when they breathe out\n*   Trouble eating or sucking (in infants)\n\n**How Is Asthma in Children Diagnosed?**\n\nIt can be hard to diagnose asthma in children, especially if they are young. Asthma has similar symptoms as other childhood conditions. And some children may not have asthma symptoms very often, so it may seem like they are having respiratory infections instead.\n\nYour child's health care provider may use many tools to diagnose asthma:\n\n*   Physical exam\n*   Medical history\n*   Chest x-ray\n*   Lung function tests, including spirometry, to test how well the lungs work. Younger children are usually not able to do these tests.\n*   Allergy skin or blood tests, if you have a history of allergies. These tests check which allergens cause a reaction from your immune system.\n\n**What Are the Treatments for Asthma in Children?**\n\nIf your child has asthma, you will work with their health care provider to create a treatment plan. The plan will include ways to manage your child's asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks, such as:\n\n*   Strategies to avoid triggers\n*   Short-term relief medicines, also called quick-relief medicines. They help prevent symptoms or relieve symptoms during an asthma attack.\n*   Control medicines. They work by reducing airway inflammation and preventing narrowing of the airways.\n\nIf your child has a severe attack and the short-term relief medicines do not work, get medical help right away.\n\n---\n\n**Asthma in Children**\n\n**What is Asthma?**\n\nAsthma is a chronic (long-term) lung disease that affects your airways, causing wheezing, coughing, and tightness in your chest.\n\n**How Does Asthma Affect Children?**\n\nAsthma often starts during childhood, usually before age 5.

An asthma trigger is something that can set off or worsen asthma symptoms. Different triggers can cause different types of asthma:\n\n*   **Allergies**: Allergic reactions to substances like pollen, dust mites, or pet dander.\n*   **Respiratory infections**: Viral or bacterial infections that affect the lungs.\n*   **Air pollution**: Exposure to pollutants in the air.\n*   **Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB)**: Tightening of the airways during physical activity.\n*   **Emotional stress**: Stress can trigger asthma symptoms in some children.\n\n**Managing Asthma in Children**\n\nTreatments can help manage asthma. Working with a healthcare provider to develop an asthma action plan is crucial for effective management. This plan should include:\n\n*   Identifying and avoiding triggers\n*   Using medication as prescribed\n*   Monitoring symptoms and lung function\n*   Knowing when to seek medical attention\n\nBy understanding the causes of asthma in children and working together with healthcare providers, parents can help their kids manage this chronic condition and live a healthy, active life.\n\n---\n\n**Asthma in Children**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Asthma?**\n\nAsthma is a chronic (long-term) lung disease that affects your airways, the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs.

In their chapter \"Asthma Pathogenesis\" in Middleton's Allergy: Principles and Practice, they discuss the various mechanisms involved in the development of asthma.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Staying Ahead of Asthma Triggers**\n\nTo effectively manage asthma, it's essential to identify and avoid triggers that can exacerbate symptoms. Some common asthma triggers include:\n\n*   **Exercise-induced asthma**: Physical activity can trigger asthma symptoms in some individuals.\n*   **Allergens**: Exposure to allergens such as dust mites, mold, or pet dander can trigger allergic reactions and worsen asthma symptoms.\n*   **Respiratory infections**: Certain respiratory infections, such as the common cold, can trigger asthma symptoms.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Using Asthma Medications Effectively**\n\nAsthma medications come in two forms: control drugs and quick-relief drugs. Control drugs, also known as maintenance medications, are used to prevent symptoms from occurring in the first place. Quick-relief drugs, on the other hand, are used to relieve symptoms when they do occur.\n\nSome common asthma medications include:\n\n*   **Inhaled corticosteroids**: These medications are commonly used to control asthma symptoms and prevent exacerbations.\n*   **Bronchodilators**: These medications help relax the airway muscles, making it easier to breathe.\n*   **Leukotriene modifiers**: These medications help reduce inflammation in the airways.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Monitoring Asthma Symptoms**\n\nRegular monitoring of asthma symptoms is crucial to effectively manage the condition. Some key indicators of asthma control include:\n\n*   **Peak flow readings**: Regular peak flow readings can help identify changes in lung function and detect potential exacerbations.\n*   **Symptom frequency**: Keeping track of symptom frequency can help identify patterns and triggers.\n*   **Quality of life**: Assessing overall quality of life can help evaluate the effectiveness of treatment and make necessary adjustments.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Working with Your Healthcare Provider**\n\nEffective asthma management requires a collaborative effort between you and your healthcare provider. Some key questions to ask your doctor include:\n\n*   **What are my triggers, and how can I avoid them?**\n*   **What medications should I take, and how often should I take them?**\n*   **How can I monitor my symptoms and adjust my treatment plan as needed?**\n\nBy working together with your healthcare provider, you can develop a personalized asthma management plan that helps you effectively manage your symptoms and improve your overall quality of life.",

    "content": "**Asthma in Children**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Asthma?**\n\nAsthma is a disease that causes the airways to swell and get narrow. It leads to wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.\n\n**Causes**\n\nAsthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) in the airways. During an asthma attack, the muscles surrounding the airways tighten. The lining of the air passages swells. As a result, less air is able to pass through.\n\n**Common Triggers**\n\nAnimals (hair or dander)\nDust, mold, and pollen\nAspirin and other medicines\nChanges in weather (most often cold weather)\nChemicals in the air or in food\nTobacco smoke\nExercise\nStrong emotions\nViral infections, such as the common cold\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nBreathing problems are common. They can include:\n\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Feeling out of breath\n*   Gasping for air\n*   Trouble breathing out (exhaling)\n*   Breathing faster than normal\n\nWhen your child is having a hard time breathing, the skin of the chest and neck may suck inward.\n\nOther symptoms of asthma in children include:\n\n*   Coughing that sometimes wakes the child up at night (it may be the only symptom).\n*   Dark bags under the eyes.\n*   Feeling tired.\n*   Irritability.\n*   Tightness in the chest.\n*   A whistling sound made when breathing (wheezing). You may notice it more when your child breathes out.\n\nYour child's asthma symptoms may vary. Symptoms may appear often or develop only when triggers are present. Some children are more likely to have asthma symptoms at night.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will use a stethoscope to listen to your child's lungs. The provider may be able to hear asthma sounds. However, lung sounds are often normal when your child is not having an asthma attack.\n\nThe provider will have your child breathe into a device called a peak flow meter. Peak flow meters can tell how well the child can blow air out of the lungs. If the airways are narrow due to asthma, peak flow values drop.\n\nYou and your child will learn to measure peak flow at home.\n\nYour child's provider may order the following tests:\n\n*   Allergy testing on the skin, or a blood test to see if your child is allergic to certain substances\n*   Chest x-ray\n*   Lung function tests\n\n**Treatment**\n\nYou and your child's providers should work together as a team to create and carry out an asthma action plan.\n\nThis plan will tell you how to:\n\n*   Avoid asthma triggers\n*   Monitor symptoms\n*   Measure peak flow\n*   Take medicines\n\nThe plan should also tell you when to call the provider. It is important to know what questions to ask your child's provider.\n\nChildren with asthma may need a lot of support at school.\n\nGive the school staff your asthma action plan so they know how to take care of your child's asthma.\nFind out how to let your child take medicine during school hours. (You may need to sign a consent form.)\nHaving asthma does not mean your child cannot exercise. Coaches, gym teachers, and your child should know what to do if your child has asthma symptoms caused by exercise.\n\n**Asthma Medicines**\n\nThere are two basic kinds of medicine used to treat asthma.\n\nLong-term control medicines are taken every day to prevent asthma symptoms. Your child should take these medicines even if no symptoms are present. Some children may need more than one long-term control medicine.\n\nTypes of long-term control medicines include:\n\n*   Inhaled steroids (these are usually the first choice of treatment)\n*   Long-acting bronchodilators (these are almost always used with inhaled steroids)\n*   Leukotriene inhibitors\n*   Cromolyn sodium\n\nQuick relief or rescue asthma medicines work fast to control asthma symptoms. Children take them when they are coughing, wheezing, having trouble breathing, or having an asthma attack.\n\nSome of your child's asthma medicines can be taken using an inhaler.\n\nChildren who use an inhaler should use a spacer device. This helps them get the medicine into the lungs properly.\nIf your child uses the inhaler the wrong way, less medicine gets into the lungs. Have your provider show your child how to correctly use an inhaler.\nYounger children can use a nebulizer instead of an inhaler to take their medicine. A nebulizer turns asthma medicine into a mist.\n\n**Getting Rid of Triggers**\n\nIt is important to know your child's asthma triggers. Avoiding them is the first step toward helping your child feel better.\n\nKeep pets outdoors, or at least away from the child's bedroom.\n\nNo one should smoke in a house or around a child with asthma.\n\nGetting rid of tobacco smoke in the home is the single most important thing a family can do to help a child with asthma.\nSmoking outside the house is not enough. Family members and visitors who smoke carry the smoke inside on their clothes and hair. This can trigger asthma symptoms.\nDo not use indoor fireplaces.\n\nKeep the house clean. Keep food in containers and out of bedrooms. This helps reduce the possibility of cockroaches, which can trigger asthma attacks. Cleaning products in the home should be unscented.\n\n**Monitoring Your Child's Asthma**\n\nChecking peak flow is one of the best ways to control asthma. It can help you keep your child's asthma from getting worse. Asthma attacks usually do not happen without warning.\n\nChildren under age 5 may not be able to use a peak flow meter well enough for it to be helpful. However, a child should start using the peak flow meter at a young age to get used to it. An adult should always watch for a child's asthma symptoms.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWith proper treatment, most children with asthma can live a normal life. When asthma is not well controlled, it can lead to missed school, problems playing sports, missed work for parents, and many visits to the provider's office and emergency room.\n\nAsthma symptoms often lessen or go away completely as the child gets older. Asthma that is not well controlled can lead to lasting lung problems.\n\nIn rare cases, asthma is a life-threatening disease. Families need to work closely with their providers to develop a plan to care for a child with asthma.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your child's provider if you think your child has new symptoms of asthma. If your child has been diagnosed with asthma, call the provider:\n\n*   After an emergency room visit\n*   When peak flow numbers have been getting lower\n*   When symptoms get more frequent and more severe, even though your child is following the asthma action plan\n\nIf your child is having trouble breathing or having an asthma attack, get medical help right away.\n\nEmergency symptoms include:\n\n*   Difficulty breathing\n*   Bluish color to the lips and face\n*   Severe anxiety due to shortness of breath\n*   Rapid pulse\n*   Sweating\n*   Decreased level of alertness, such as severe drowsiness or confusion\n\nA child who is having a severe asthma attack may need to stay in the hospital and get oxygen and medicines through a vein (intravenous line or IV).\n\n---\n\n**Asthma in Children**\n\nAsthma is a disease that causes the airways to swell and get narrow.

Asthma attacks usually do not happen without warning.\n\nChildren under age 5 may not be able to use a peak flow meter well enough for it to be helpful. However, a child should start using the peak flow meter at a young age to get used to it. An adult should always watch for a child's asthma symptoms.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWith proper treatment, most children with asthma can live a normal life. When asthma is not well controlled, it can lead to missed school, problems playing sports, missed work for parents, and many visits to the provider's office and emergency room.\n\nAsthma symptoms often lessen or go away completely as the child gets older. Asthma that is not well controlled can lead to lasting lung problems.\n\nIn rare cases, asthma is a life-threatening disease. Families need to work closely with their providers to develop a plan to care for a child with asthma.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your child's provider if you think your child has new symptoms of asthma. If your child has been diagnosed with asthma, call the provider:\n\n* After an emergency room visit\n* When peak flow numbers have been getting lower\n* When symptoms get more frequent and more severe, even though your child is following the asthma action plan\n\nIf your child is having trouble breathing or having an asthma attack, get medical help right away.\n\nEmergency symptoms include:\n\n* Difficulty breathing\n* Bluish color to the lips and face\n* Severe anxiety due to shortness of breath\n* Rapid pulse\n* Sweating\n* Decreased level of alertness, such as severe drowsiness or confusion\n\nA child who is having a severe asthma attack may need to stay in the hospital and get oxygen and medicines through a vein (intravenous line or IV).\n\n---\n\n**Asthma in Children**\n\n**What is Asthma?**\n\nAsthma is a chronic disease that affects the airways of the lungs. It causes recurring episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of asthma is still unknown, but it is believed to be related to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some risk factors include:\n\n* Family history of asthma\n* Allergies\n* Respiratory infections\n* Exposure to air pollution\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of asthma can vary from person to person, but common ones include:\n\n* Wheezing or coughing\n* Chest tightness or discomfort\n* Shortness of breath or feeling like you can't catch your breath\n* Coughing that worsens at night or with exercise\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nAsthma is typically diagnosed based on a combination of the following:\n\n* Medical history and physical examination\n* Lung function tests, such as spirometry\n* Allergy testing\n* Imaging studies, such as chest X-rays or CT scans\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to control symptoms, prevent exacerbations, and improve quality of life. Treatment may include:\n\n* Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to reduce inflammation\n* Bronchodilators to relax airway muscles\n* Combination therapy with ICS and bronchodilator\n* Quick-relief medications for acute symptoms\n\n**Lifestyle Changes**\n\nIn addition to medication, there are several lifestyle changes that can help manage asthma:\n\n* Avoid triggers, such as allergens or pollution\n* Use a peak flow meter to monitor lung function\n* Exercise regularly, but avoid overexertion\n* Get enough sleep and maintain a healthy weight\n\n**Asthma in Children**\n\nChildren with asthma may experience different symptoms than adults, such as:\n\n* Coughing or wheezing after exercise or at night\n* Shortness of breath or feeling like they can't catch their breath\n* Chest tightness or discomfort\n\n**Managing Asthma at School**\n\nIf your child has asthma, it's essential to work with their school to develop a plan for managing their condition. This may include:\n\n* Creating an asthma action plan\n* Providing emergency medication and equipment\n* Educating teachers and staff about asthma symptoms and treatment\n\n**Images**\n\n* Normal versus asthmatic bronchiole\n* Peak flow meter\n* Lungs\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\n* Asthma and school\n* Asthma - control drugs\n* Asthma in children - what to ask your doctor\n* Asthma - quick-relief drugs\n* Exercise-induced asthma\n* Exercising and asthma at school\n* How to use a nebulizer\n* How to use an inhaler - no spacer\n* How to use an inhaler - with spacer\n* How to use your peak flow meter\n* Make peak flow a habit\n* Signs of an asthma attack\n* Stay away from asthma triggers",

    "content": "**Asthma**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is asthma?**\n\nAsthma is a chronic lung disease that affects your airways, the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. When you have asthma, your airways can become inflamed and narrowed, causing wheezing, coughing, and tightness in your chest.\n\n**What causes asthma?**\n\nThe exact cause of asthma is unknown, but genetics and your environment likely play a role in who gets asthma.\n\n**An asthma attack**\n\nAn asthma attack can happen when you are exposed to an asthma trigger. An asthma trigger is something that can set off or worsen your asthma symptoms. Different triggers can cause different types of asthma:\n\n*   **Allergic asthma**: caused by allergens, such as dust mites, mold, pets, pollen from grass, trees, and weeds, waste from pests such as cockroaches and mice.\n*   **Nonallergic asthma**: caused by triggers that are not allergens, such as breathing in cold air, certain medicines, household chemicals, infections such as colds and the flu, outdoor air pollution, tobacco smoke.\n*   **Occupational asthma**: caused by breathing in chemicals or industrial dusts at work.\n*   **Exercise-induced asthma**: happens during physical exercise, especially when the air is dry.\n\n**Who is at risk for asthma?**\n\nAsthma affects people of all ages, but it often starts during childhood. Certain factors can raise your risk of having asthma:\n\n*   Being exposed to secondhand smoke when your mother is pregnant with you or when you are a small child\n*   Being exposed to certain substances at work, such as chemical irritants or industrial dusts\n*   Genetics and family history. You are more likely to have asthma if one of your parents has it, especially if it's your mother.\n*   Race or ethnicity. Black and African Americans and Puerto Ricans are at higher risk of asthma than people of other races or ethnicities.\n*   Having other diseases or conditions such as obesity and allergies\n*   Often having viral respiratory infections as a young child\n*   Sex. In children, asthma is more common in boys. In teens and adults, it is more common in women.\n\n**What are the symptoms of asthma?**\n\nThe symptoms of asthma include:\n\n*   Chest tightness\n*   Coughing, especially at night or early morning\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Wheezing, which causes a whistling sound when you breathe out\n\nThese symptoms can range from mild to severe. You may have them every day or only once in a while.\n\n**How is asthma diagnosed?**\n\nYour health care provider may use many tools to diagnose asthma:\n\n*   Physical exam\n*   Medical history\n*   Lung function tests, including spirometry, to test how well your lungs work\n*   Tests to measure how your airways react to specific exposures. During this test, you inhale different concentrations of allergens or medicines that may tighten the muscles in your airways. Spirometry is done before and after the test.\n*   Peak expiratory flow (PEF) tests to measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effort\n*   Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests to measure levels of nitric oxide in your breath when you breathe out. High levels of nitric oxide may mean that your lungs are inflamed.\n*   Allergy skin or blood tests, if you have a history of allergies. These tests check which allergens cause a reaction from your immune system.\n\n**What are the treatments for asthma?**\n\nIf you have asthma, you will work with your health care provider to create a treatment plan. The plan will include ways to manage your asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks. It will include:\n\n*   Strategies to avoid triggers. For example, if tobacco smoke is a trigger for you, you should not smoke or allow other people to smoke in your home or car.\n*   Short-term relief medicines, also called quick-relief medicines. They help prevent symptoms or relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. They include an inhaler to carry with you all the time. It may also include other types of medicines which work quickly to help open your airways.\n*   Control medicines. You take them every day to help prevent symptoms. They work by reducing airway inflammation and preventing narrowing of the airways.\n\nIf you have a severe attack and the short-term relief medicines do not work, you will need emergency care.\n\nYour provider may adjust your treatment until asthma symptoms are controlled.\n\nSometimes asthma is severe and cannot be controlled with other treatments. If you are an adult with uncontrolled asthma, in some cases your provider might suggest bronchial thermoplasty. This is a procedure that uses heat to shrink the smooth muscle in the lungs. Shrinking the muscle reduces your airway's ability to tighten and allows you to breathe more easily. The procedure has some risks, so it's important to discuss them with your provider.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Start Here**\n\n*   **About Asthma (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)**: Learn about asthma from a trusted source.\n*   **Asthma  (National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences)**: Understand how the environment affects asthma.\n*   **What Is Asthma?

    "content": "**Asthma**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nAsthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) in the airways. An asthma attack occurs when the lining of the air passages has become swollen and the muscles surrounding the airways become tight. This narrowing reduces the amount of air that can pass through the airway.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Common Asthma Triggers**\n\n* Animals (pet hair or dander)\n* Dust mites\n* Certain medicines (aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs])\n* Changes in weather (most often cold weather)\n* Chemicals in the air (pollution) or in food\n* Physical activity\n* Mold\n* Pollen\n* Respiratory infections, such as the common cold and many other viruses\n* Strong emotions (stress)\n* Tobacco or other inhalant that is smoked\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nAsthma symptoms vary from person to person. For example, you may have symptoms all the time or mostly during physical activity.\n\nMost people with asthma have attacks separated by symptom-free periods. Some people have long-term shortness of breath with episodes of increased shortness of breath. Wheezing or a cough may be the main symptom.\n\nSymptoms of asthma include:\n\n* Cough with or without sputum (phlegm) production\n* Pulling in of the skin between the ribs when breathing (intercostal retractions)\n* Shortness of breath that gets worse with exercise or activity\n* Whistling sound or wheezing as you breathe\n* Pain or tightness in the chest\n* Difficulty sleeping\n* Abnormal breathing pattern (breathing out takes more than twice as long as breathing in)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Emergency Symptoms**\n\n* Bluish color to the lips and face (cyanosis)\n* Decreased level of alertness, such as severe drowsiness or confusion, during an asthma attack\n* Extreme difficulty breathing\n* Rapid pulse\n* Severe anxiety due to shortness of breath\n* Sweating\n* Difficulty speaking\n* Breathing temporarily stops\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will use a stethoscope to listen to your lungs. Wheezing or other asthma-related sounds may be heard. The provider will take your medical history and ask about your symptoms.\n\nTests that may be ordered include:\n\n* Allergy testing -- a skin test or a blood test to see if a person with asthma is allergic to certain substances\n* Arterial blood gas -- often done in people who are having a severe asthma attack\n* Chest x-ray or CT scan of the chest -- to check for other conditions\n* Lung function tests, including peak flow measurements\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goals of treatment are to:\n\nControl airway swelling\nLimit exposure to substances that may trigger your symptoms\nHelp you to be able to do normal activities without having asthma symptoms\n\nYou and your provider should work as a team to manage your asthma symptoms. Follow your provider's instructions on taking medicines, eliminating asthma triggers, and monitoring symptoms.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Medicines for Asthma**\n\nThere are two kinds of medicines for treating asthma:\n\nLong term or control medicines to help prevent attacks\nQuick-relief (rescue) medicines for use during attacks\n\nLONG-TERM MEDICINES\n\nThese are also called maintenance or control medicines. They are used to prevent symptoms in people with moderate to severe asthma. You must take these medicines every day for them to work. Take them even when you feel OK.\n\nSome long-term medicines are breathed in (inhaled), such as steroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Others are taken by mouth (orally). Your provider will prescribe the right medicine for you.\n\nQUICK-RELIEF MEDICINES\n\nThese are also called rescue medicines. They are taken:\n\nFor coughing, wheezing, trouble breathing, or during an asthma attack\nJust before physical activity to help prevent asthma symptoms\n\nTell your provider if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more. If so, your asthma may not be under control. Your provider may change the dose or your daily asthma control medicine to reduce the use of quick-relief medicines.\n\nQuick-relief medicines include:\n\n* Short-acting inhaled bronchodilators\n* Oral corticosteroids for a severe asthma attack\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Asthma Care at Home**\n\nYou can take steps to decrease the possibility of asthma attacks:\n\nKnow the asthma symptoms to watch for.\nKnow how to take your peak flow reading and what it means.\nKnow which triggers make your asthma worse and what to do when it happens.\nKnow how to care of your asthma before and during physical activity or exercise.\n\nAsthma action plans are written documents for managing asthma. An asthma action plan should include:\n\nInstructions for taking asthma medicines when your condition is stable\nA list of asthma triggers and how to avoid them\nHow to recognize when your asthma is getting worse, what to do and when to call your provider\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThere is no cure for asthma, although symptoms sometimes improve over time. With proper self-care and medical treatment, most people with asthma can lead a normal life.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nThe complications of asthma can be severe, and may include:\n\nDeath\nDecreased ability to exercise and take part in other activities\nLack of sleep due to nighttime symptoms\nPermanent changes in the function of the lungs\nPersistent cough\nTrouble breathing that requires breathing assistance (ventilator)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider for an appointment if asthma symptoms develop.\n\nContact your provider right away if:\n\nAn asthma attack requires more medicine than recommended\nSymptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment\nYou have shortness of breath while talking\nYour peak flow measurement is 50% to 80% of your personal best\n\nGo to the emergency room right away if these symptoms occur:\n\nDrowsiness or confusion\nSevere shortness of breath at rest\nA peak flow measurement of less than 50% of your personal best\nSevere chest pain\nBluish color to the lips and face (cyanosis)\nExtreme difficulty breathing\nRapid pulse\nSevere anxiety due to shortness of breath\n\n---\n\n**Asthma: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (Part 2/7)**\n\n**Reducing Exposure to Asthma Triggers**\n\nTo reduce exposure to asthma triggers, consider the following:\n\n*   Remove carpets from bedrooms and vacuum regularly.\n*   Use only unscented detergents and cleaning materials in the home.\n*   Keep humidity levels low and fix leaks to reduce the growth of organisms such as mold.\n*   Keep the house clean and keep food in containers and out of bedrooms. This helps reduce the possibility of cockroaches.\n\n**Animal Allergies**\n\nIf someone is allergic to an animal that cannot be removed from the home, the animal should be kept out of the bedroom. Place filtering material over the heating/air conditioning outlets in your home to trap animal dander. Change the filter in furnaces and air conditioners often.\n\n**Tobacco Smoke**\n\nEliminate tobacco smoke from the home. This is the single most important thing a family can do to help someone with asthma. Smoking outside the house is not enough. Family members and visitors who smoke outside carry smoke residue inside on their clothes and hair. This can trigger asthma symptoms. If you smoke, now is a good time to quit.\n\n**Avoiding Air Pollution**\n\nAvoid air pollution, industrial dust, and irritating fumes as much as possible.\n\n---\n\n**Asthma**\n\n_A Chronic Disease That Causes the Airways of the Lungs to Swell and Narrow_\n\nAsthma is a chronic disease that causes the airways of the lungs to swell and narrow. It leads to breathing difficulty such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.\n\n**Causes**\n\n_Asthma is Caused by Swelling (Inflammation) in the Airways_\n\nAsthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) in the airways.

An asthma attack occurs when the lining of the air passages has become swollen and the muscles surrounding the airways become tight. This narrowing reduces the amount of air that can pass through the airway.\n\n**Triggers**\n\nCommon asthma triggers include:\n\n*   Substances in some workplaces, such as wood dust, grain dust, animal dander, fungi, or chemicals\n*   Many people with asthma have a personal or family history of allergies, such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or eczema. Others have no history of allergies.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nAsthma symptoms vary from person to person. For example, you may have symptoms all the time or mostly during physical activity.\n\nMost people with asthma have attacks separated by symptom-free periods. Some people have long-term shortness of breath with episodes of increased shortness of breath. Wheezing or a cough may be the main symptom.\n\nSymptoms of asthma include:\n\n*   Cough with or without sputum (phlegm) production\n*   Pulling in of the skin between the ribs when breathing (intercostal retractions)\n*   Shortness of breath that gets worse with exercise or activity\n*   Whistling sound or wheezing as you breathe\n*   Pain or tightness in the chest\n*   Difficulty sleeping\n*   Abnormal breathing pattern (breathing out takes more than twice as long as breathing in)\n\nEmergency symptoms that need prompt medical help include:\n\n*   Bluish color to the lips and face (cyanosis)\n*   Decreased level of alertness, such as severe drowsiness or confusion, during an asthma attack\n*   Extreme difficulty breathing\n*   Rapid pulse\n*   Severe anxiety due to shortness of breath\n*   Sweating\n*   Difficulty speaking\n*   Breathing temporarily stops\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will use a stethoscope to listen to your lungs. Wheezing or other asthma-related sounds may be heard. The provider will take your medical history and ask about your symptoms.\n\nTests that may be ordered include:\n\n*   Allergy testing -- a skin test or a blood test to see if a person with asthma is allergic to certain substances\n*   Arterial blood gas -- often done in people who are having a severe asthma attack\n*   Chest x-ray or CT scan of the chest -- to check for other conditions\n*   Lung function tests, including peak flow measurements\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goals of treatment are to:\n\n*   Control airway swelling\n*   Limit exposure to substances that may trigger your symptoms\n*   Help you to be able to do normal activities without having asthma symptoms\n\nYou and your provider should work as a team to manage your asthma symptoms. Follow your provider's instructions on taking medicines, eliminating asthma triggers, and monitoring symptoms.\n\n**Medicines for Asthma**\n\nThere are two kinds of medicines for treating asthma:\n\n*   Long-term or control medicines to help prevent attacks\n*   Quick-relief (rescue) medicines for use during attacks\n\nLong-term medicines are breathed in (inhaled), such as steroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Others are taken by mouth (orally). Your provider will prescribe the right medicine for you.\n\nQuick-relief medicines include:\n\n*   Short-acting inhaled bronchodilators\n*   Oral corticosteroids for a severe asthma attack\n\nA severe asthma attack requires a visit to a provider. You may also need a hospital stay. There, you will likely be given oxygen, breathing assistance, and medicines given through a vein (IV).\n\n**Asthma Care at Home**\n\nYou can take steps to decrease the possibility of asthma attacks:\n\n*   Know the asthma symptoms to watch for.\n*   Know how to take your peak flow reading and what it means.\n*   Know which triggers make your asthma worse and what to do when it happens.\n*   Know how to care of your asthma before and during physical activity or exercise.\n\nAsthma action plans are written documents for managing asthma.

    "content": "**Astigmatism**\n\nAstigmatism is a type of refractive error of the eye. Refractive errors cause blurred vision. They are the most common reason why a person goes to see an eye professional.\n\n**Other Types of Refractive Errors**\n\n* Farsightedness\n* Nearsightedness\n\n**Causes**\n\nPeople are able to see because the front part of the eye bends (refracts) light and focuses it on the retina. This is the inside of the back surface of the eye.\n\nIf the light rays are not clearly focused on the retina, the images you see may be blurry.\n\nWith astigmatism, the cornea is abnormally curved. This curve causes vision to be out of focus.\n\nThe cause of astigmatism is unknown. It is most often present from birth. Astigmatism often occurs together with nearsightedness or farsightedness. If astigmatism gets worse, it may be a sign of keratoconus.\n\nAstigmatism is very common. It sometimes occurs after certain types of eye surgery, such as cataract surgery.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nAstigmatism makes it hard to see fine details, either close up or from a distance.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nAstigmatism is easily diagnosed by a standard eye exam with refraction test. Special tests are not required in most cases.\n\nChildren or adults who cannot respond to a normal refraction test can have their refraction measured by a test that uses reflected light (retinoscopy).\n\n**Treatment**\n\nMild astigmatism may not need to be corrected.\n\nGlasses or contact lenses will correct astigmatism, but do not cure it.\n\nLaser surgery can help change the shape of the cornea surface to eliminate astigmatism, along with nearsightedness or farsightedness.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nAstigmatism may change with time, requiring new glasses or contact lenses. Laser vision correction can most often eliminate, or greatly reduce astigmatism.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nIn children, uncorrected astigmatism in only one eye may cause amblyopia.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider or ophthalmologist if vision problems worsen, or do not improve with glasses or contact lenses.\n\n---\n\n**Astigmatism**\n\n**What is Astigmatism?**\n\nAstigmatism is a condition where the cornea, the clear dome-shaped surface at the front of the eye, is abnormally curved.

During this stage, there are no symptoms of HIV infection.\n\n**How Long Does This Stage Last?**\n\nThe length of this stage depends on how quickly the HIV virus copies itself and how a person's genes affect their body's handling of the virus. Some people may have symptoms and worsening immune function within a few years after the original infection, while others can go 10 years or longer without symptoms.\n\n**References:**\n\n* Reitz MS, Gallo RC.
