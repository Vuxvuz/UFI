    "content": "**Creatine Kinase: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 1/3)**\n\n**What is a Creatine Kinase (CK) Test?**\n\nThis test measures the amount of creatine kinase (CK) in a sample of your blood. CK is also called creatine phosphokinase (CPK).\n\n**CK: An Enzyme That Helps Make Energy**\n\nCK is an enzyme that helps make energy for your body. Most of the CK in your body is in your skeletal muscles, which are the muscles you use to move. You also have CK in your heart muscle and small amounts in your brain.\n\n**When Is a CK Test Needed?**\n\nA CK test is mainly used to help diagnose and monitor injuries and diseases that damage skeletal muscles and cause high levels of CK in your blood. But it may also be used for conditions that damage the heart muscle and the brain.\n\n**Other Names: CK, Total CK, Creatine Phosphokinase, CPK**\n\n*CK, total CK, creatine phosphokinase, CPK*\n\n**What Happens During a CK Test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a CK test. To help make sure your results are accurate, your provider may ask you to avoid intense exercise and drinking alcohol for a few days before your test.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nNormal CK levels for you will depend on:\n\n* Your age, sex, and race\n* How much muscle you have\n* How physically active you are\n\nIf your CK level is higher than normal, it usually means you have some type of muscle damage. CK levels may not reach their highest until up to two days after certain injuries. So, you may have more than one CK test to see if your levels go up or down. CK levels that stay high or increase may mean that muscle damage is continuing to happen.\n\nBut a CK test result can't show where the damage is or what's causing it. Your provider will consider your symptoms and medical history to understand what your test results mean.\n\n---\n\n**Creatine Kinase: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 2/3)**\n\n**What is a Creatine Kinase (CK) Test?**\n\nA CK test measures the level of creatine kinase in your blood. This enzyme is found in muscle tissue, and when there's damage to your muscles, heart, or brain, it can leak into your bloodstream.\n\n**When is a CK Test Used?**\n\nYou may need a CK test if you have symptoms of a muscular disorder, such as:\n\n* Muscle pain and/or cramps\n* Muscle weakness\n* Balance problems and/or falling a lot\n* Numbness or tingling\n* Dark colored urine (pee)\n* Swollen legs or feet\n\nYou may also need this test if you:\n\n* Have had an injury that crushed or tore your muscles\n* Have had serious burns\n* Take certain medicines that may cause muscle damage, such as statins to lower blood cholesterol\n* Have had a stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI)\n\n**What Happens During a CK Test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I Need to Do Anything to Prepare for the Test?**\n\nYou don't need any special preparations for a CK test. To help make sure your results are accurate, your provider may ask you to avoid intense exercise and drinking alcohol for a few days before your test.\n\n**Are There Any Risks to the Test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nNormal CK levels for you will depend on:\n\n* Your age, sex, and race\n* How much muscle you have\n* How physically active you are\n\nIf your CK level is higher than normal, it usually means you have some type of muscle damage. CK levels may not reach their highest until up to two days after certain injuries. So, you may have more than one CK test to see if your levels go up or down.\n\nCK levels that stay high or increase may mean that muscle damage is continuing to happen. But a CK test result can't show where the damage is or what's causing it. Your provider will consider your symptoms and medical history to understand what your test results mean.\n\nIf the source of high or increasing CK levels isn't clear, you may need a more specific type of CK test to find out if the CK is coming from your muscles, heart, or brain. This more specific test is called a CK isoenzymes test.\n\n**CK Isoenzymes Test**\n\nA CK isoenzymes test measures three different types of CK:\n\n* High levels of CK-MM enzymes are most likely from damage to your skeletal muscles.\n* High levels of CK-MB enzymes are most likely from damage to your heart muscle.\n* Higher than normal CK-BB enzymes may mean you had a stroke or brain injury.\n\nTo diagnose the condition causing high CK levels, you may need other types of tests, too. The tests you have will depend on which types of CK enzymes are high as well as your symptoms and medical history.\n\n---\n\n**Creatine Kinase: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 3/3)**\n\n**What is Creatine Kinase?**\n\nCreatine kinase (CK) is an enzyme found in the body that helps convert creatine into a form that can be used by muscles. It's also known as phosphocreatine kinase.\n\n**Why is Creatine Kinase Important?**\n\nCK plays a crucial role in muscle function and energy production. When muscles contract, CK helps break down ATP (adenosine triphosphate) to release energy. This process is essential for physical activity, such as exercise or sports.\n\n**What are the Different Types of Creatine Kinase?**\n\nThere are three main types of CK:\n\n1. **CK-BB**: Found in the brain and nervous system.\n2. **CK-MM**: Predominantly found in skeletal muscle.\n3. **CK-MB**: Found in heart muscle, smooth muscle, and certain other tissues.\n\n**What Does a Creatine Kinase Test Measure?**\n\nA CK test measures the levels of CK-BB, CK-MM, and CK-MB enzymes in your blood or urine. Elevated levels may indicate muscle damage, inflammation, or other conditions affecting the muscles or nervous system.\n\n**When is a Creatine Kinase Test Ordered?**\n\nYour healthcare provider may order a CK test to:\n\n1. Diagnose muscle disorders, such as muscular dystrophy.\n2. Evaluate symptoms like muscle weakness, pain, or swelling.\n3. Monitor treatment effectiveness for conditions like rhabdomyolysis (a serious condition caused by severe muscle damage).\n4. Identify potential complications related to heart disease or stroke.\n\n**How is a Creatine Kinase Test Performed?**\n\nA CK test typically involves:\n\n1. Blood sample collection from a vein in your arm.\n2. Urine sample collection, if necessary.\n3. Laboratory analysis of the samples to measure CK enzyme levels.\n\n**What are the Normal Ranges for Creatine Kinase?**\n\nNormal ranges vary depending on the laboratory and testing method used. Generally, normal values range from 0 to 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Elevated levels above 10-20 times the ULN may indicate muscle damage or other conditions.\n\n**What are the Risks and Considerations for a Creatine Kinase Test?**\n\nWhile generally safe, CK testing may have risks associated with:\n\n1. Blood sample collection.\n2. Laboratory analysis errors.\n3. False-positive results due to certain medications or medical conditions.\n\nConsult your healthcare provider if you have questions about your test results or diagnosis.\n\n**Learn More About Laboratory Tests and Understanding Results**\n\nVisit MedlinePlus for more information on laboratory tests, reference ranges, and interpreting results.\n\n**References**\n\nAujla RS, Patel R.

It may be taken from a vein using a procedure called venipuncture.\n\n**How to prepare for the test?**\n\nNo special preparation is usually needed. However, it's essential to inform your healthcare provider about any medications you're taking.\n\n**Drugs that can increase CPK measurements:**\n\n*   Alcohol\n*   Amphotericin B\n*   Certain anesthetics\n*   Cocaine\n*   Fibrate drugs\n*   Statins\n*   Steroids, such as dexamethasone\n\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n**How will the test feel?**\n\nYou may experience slight pain when the needle is inserted to draw blood. Some people might only feel a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\n\n**Why is the test performed?**\n\nWhen your total CPK level is very high, it usually indicates injury or stress to muscle tissue, the heart, or the brain. Muscle tissue injury is most likely, as CPK leaks into the bloodstream when a muscle is damaged. Finding which specific form of CPK is high helps determine which tissue has been damaged.\n\nThis test may be used to:\n\n*   Diagnose heart attack\n*   Evaluate cause of chest pain\n*   Determine if or how badly a muscle is damaged\n*   Detect dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and other muscle diseases\n*   Tell the difference between malignant hyperthermia and postoperative infection\n\nThe pattern and timing of a rise or fall in CPK levels can be significant in making a diagnosis, especially if a heart attack is suspected.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nTotal CPK normal values range from 10 to 120 micrograms per liter (mcg/L). Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. It's essential to discuss the meaning of your specific test results with your provider.\n\n**What do abnormal results mean?**\n\nHigh CPK levels may be seen in people who have:\n\n*   Brain injury or stroke\n*   Convulsions\n*   Delirium tremens\n*   Dermatomyositis or polymyositis\n*   Electric shock\n*   Heart attack\n*   Inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis)\n*   Lung tissue death (pulmonary infarction)\n*   Muscular dystrophies\n*   Myopathy\n*   Rhabdomyolysis\n*   Trauma\n\nOther conditions that may give positive test results include:\n\n*   Hypothyroidism\n*   Hyperthyroidism\n*   Pericarditis following a heart attack\n\n---\n\n**Creatine Phosphokinase Test**\n\n**What is Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK)?**\n\nCreatine phosphokinase (CPK) is an enzyme in the body found mainly in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle.\n\n**How is the Test Performed?**\n\nA blood sample is needed, which may be taken from a vein. The procedure is called a venipuncture.

It includes your health information and that of your grandparents, aunts and uncles, parents, and siblings.\n\n**What Is a Family History?**\n\nMany factors affect your health. These include your:\n\n* Genes\n* Diet and exercise habits\n* Environment\n* Lifestyle choices such as tobacco or alcohol use\n\nFamily members tend to share certain behaviors, genetic traits, and habits. Creating a family health history can help you identify the specific risks that influence your health and your family's health.\n\nFor example, having a family member with a condition such as diabetes may increase your risk of getting it. The risk is higher when:\n\n* More than one person in the family has the condition\n* A family member developed the condition 10 to 20 years earlier than most other people with the condition\n\nSerious diseases such as heart diseases, diabetes, cancer, and stroke are more likely to run in families. You can share this information with your health care provider who can suggest ways to reduce your risk.\n\n**What Should Be Included in Your Family Health History?**\n\nFor a complete family health history, you will need health information about your:\n\n* Parents\n* Grandparents\n* Aunts and Uncles\n* Cousins\n* Sisters and brothers\n* Children\n\nYou can ask for this information at family gatherings or reunions. You may need to explain:\n\n* Why you are gathering this information\n* How it will help you and others in your family\n\nYou can even offer to share what you find with other family members.\n\nFor a complete picture of each relative, find out:\n\n* Date of birth or approximate age\n* Where the person grew up and lived\n* Any health habits they are willing to share, such as smoking or drinking alcohol\n* Medical conditions, long-term (chronic) conditions such as asthma, and serious conditions such as cancer\n* Any history of mental illness\n* Age at which they developed the medical condition\n* Any learning problems or developmental disabilities\n* Birth defects\n* Problems with pregnancies or childbirth\n* The age and cause of death for relatives who are deceased\n* Which country/region your family originally came from (Ireland, Germany, Eastern Europe, Africa, and so on)\n\nAsk these same questions about any relatives who have died.\n\n**How Will a Family History Help You and Your Family?**\n\nShare your family health history with your provider and your child's provider. Your provider can use this information to help lower your risk for certain conditions or diseases. For example, your provider may recommend certain tests, such as:\n\n* Early screening tests if you are at a higher risk than the average person\n* Genetic tests before you get pregnant to see if you carry the gene for certain rare diseases\n\nYour provider also may suggest lifestyle changes to help reduce your risk. These may include:\n\n* Eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise\n* Losing extra weight\n* Quitting smoking\n* Reducing how much alcohol you drink\n\n---\n\n**Creating a Family Health History**\n\nAs you plan to start a family, it's essential to create a family health history. This record of your family's health information can help you identify potential health risks and take steps to reduce them.\n\n**Why Create a Family Health History?**\n\nMany health problems tend to run in families. Creating a family health history can help you and your family be aware of possible health risks so you can take steps to reduce them.\n\n**What Should Be Included in Your Family Health History?**\n\nFor a complete family health history, you will need health information about your:\n\n* Parents\n* Grandparents\n* Aunts and Uncles\n* Cousins\n* Sisters and brothers\n* Children\n\nYou can ask for this information at family gatherings or reunions.

    "content": "**Creatinine Test**\n\nThis test measures creatinine levels in a sample of your blood and/or urine (pee). Creatinine is a normal waste product in your body. It's made when you use your muscles and some of the muscle tissue breaks down.\n\nNormally, your kidneys filter creatinine from your blood and remove it from your body in your urine. If there is a problem with your kidneys, creatinine can build up in your blood and less may be released in urine. If blood and/or urine creatinine levels are not normal, it may be a sign of kidney disease.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA creatinine test is used to help:\n\n* Check the health of your kidneys\n* Diagnose kidney disease\n* Monitor known kidney problems and see how well treatment is working\n* Check for side effects from medicines that may affect your kidneys\n\n**Why do I need a creatinine test?**\n\nYour provider may order a creatinine test:\n\n* To check your kidney health as part of a routine checkup.\n* If you have symptoms of kidney disease. Symptoms may include:\n\t+ Swelling in the hands and feet or puffy eyelids\n\t+ Dry skin, itching, or numbness\n\t+ Fatigue\n\t+ Increased or decreased need to urinate (pee)\n\t+ Urine that is bloody or foamy\n\t+ Loss of appetite and weight loss\n\t+ Muscle cramps\n\t+ Nausea and vomiting\n\t+ Shortness of breath\n\t+ Sleep problems\n\t+ Trouble thinking clearly\n* If you have a high risk for developing kidney disease, even if you don't have symptoms now. Chronic (long-term) kidney disease (CKD) often doesn't have symptoms in the early stages. Your risk for kidney disease is increased if you:\n\t+ Have diabetes\n\t+ Have high blood pressure\n\t+ Have a family health history of kidney disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure\n\t+ Have heart disease\n\t+ Are over 50 years old\n\t+ Smoke\n\t+ Have obesity\n\n**What happens during a creatinine test?**\n\nFor a creatinine blood test:\n\n* A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\nFor a creatinine urine test:\n\n* You may need to provide all the urine you pass over 24 hours. That's because creatinine levels vary through the day. But your provider may use a urine sample from a shorter period of time.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYour provider will let you know how to prepare for your test. You may be told to not eat meat for 24 hours before your test. That's because meat can temporarily increase creatinine levels.\n\nIf creatinine is being measured as part of a CMP or a BMP test, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for up to 12 hours before your test.\n\nCertain medicines and supplements can affect your test results. So be sure to tell your provider everything you're taking. But don't stop taking any medicine unless your provider tells you to stop.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nCreatinine levels that are considered normal for you will depend on how much muscle you have, what you eat, your age, and how active you are. If you're healthy, your levels are usually fairly stable over time.\n\nBut a normal creatinine test result doesn't always mean that your kidneys are healthy. Sometimes, blood creatinine levels remain in a normal range during the early stages of kidney disease. They rise as the condition of your kidneys becomes more serious. If your provider suspects you have a kidney condition, you will likely have other kidney tests even if your creatinine results seem normal.\n\nIf your results are abnormal, a single high creatinine test can't diagnose a specific condition. You will likely need to be retested and/or have other tests, too.\n\nIn general, if your blood creatinine level is:\n\n* High for you, it may be a sign of:\n\t+ Kidney disease or injury, including infection, poor blood flow to the kidneys, a blockage in the urinary system, or kidney failure\n\t+ A condition that affects your kidneys, such as heart failure or diabetes\n\n---\n\n**Creatinine Test: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 2/4)**\n\n**What is a Creatinine Test?**\n\nA creatinine test measures creatinine levels in a sample of your blood and/or urine. Creatinine is a normal waste product in your body, made when you use your muscles and some muscle tissue breaks down.\n\nNormally, your kidneys filter creatinine from your blood and remove it from your body in your urine. If there's a problem with your kidneys, creatinine can build up in your blood and less may be released in urine. Abnormal blood and/or urine creatinine levels may indicate kidney disease.\n\n**What is it Used For?**\n\nA creatinine test helps:\n\n* Check the health of your kidneys\n* Diagnose kidney disease\n* Monitor known kidney problems and see how well treatment is working\n* Check for side effects from medicines that may affect your kidneys\n\nCreatinine testing alone isn't the best way to check how well your kidneys are working. That's because people make different amounts of creatinine depending on their muscle mass, diet, age, and activity level.\n\n**Why Do I Need a Creatinine Test?**\n\nYour provider may order a creatinine test:\n\n* To check your kidney health as part of a routine checkup\n* If you have symptoms of kidney disease, such as swelling in the hands and feet or puffy eyelids, dry skin, itching, or numbness, fatigue, increased or decreased need to urinate (pee), urine that is bloody or foamy, loss of appetite and weight loss, muscle cramps, nausea and vomiting, shortness of breath, sleep problems, trouble thinking clearly\n* If you have a high risk for developing kidney disease, even if you don't have symptoms now. Chronic (long-term) kidney disease (CKD) often doesn't have symptoms in the early stages.\n\n**What Happens During a Creatinine Test?**\n\nFor a creatinine blood test:\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle.

This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\nFor a creatinine urine test:\n\nYou may need to provide all the urine you pass over 24 hours. That's because creatinine levels vary through the day. But your provider may use a urine sample from a shorter period of time.\n\nFor a 24-hour urine sample, you will be given a special container to collect your urine over a full day and instructions on how to collect and store your sample. Your provider will tell you what time to start. The test generally includes the following steps:\n\n* To begin, urinate in the toilet as usual. Do not collect this urine. Write down the time you urinated.\n* For the next 24 hours, collect all your urine in the container.\n* During the collection period, store the urine container in a refrigerator or in a cooler with ice.\n* 24 hours after starting the test, try to urinate if you can. This is the last urine collection for the test.\n* Return the container with your urine to your provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.\n\n---\n\n**Creatinine Test: Understanding the Results**\n\nWhen it comes to interpreting creatinine test results, there are several factors to consider. Creatinine levels that are considered normal for you will depend on how much muscle you have, what you eat, your age, and how active you are.\n\n**What Do Normal Results Mean?**\n\nIf you're healthy, your levels are usually fairly stable over time. However, a normal creatinine test result doesn't always mean that your kidneys are healthy. Sometimes, blood creatinine levels remain in a normal range during the early stages of kidney disease. They rise as the condition of your kidneys becomes more serious.\n\n**What Do Abnormal Results Mean?**\n\nIf your results are abnormal, a single high creatinine test can't diagnose a specific condition. You will likely need to be retested and/or have other tests, too.\n\n**Interpreting High Blood Creatinine Levels**\n\nHigh blood creatinine levels don't always mean you have a kidney problem. They may be caused by:\n\n* Dehydration\n* Muscle disorders and injuries\n* Muscular dystrophy\n* Intense exercise\n* A diet high in meat\n* Certain health problems in pregnancy\n\n**Interpreting Low Blood Creatinine Levels**\n\nLow blood creatinine levels may indicate malnutrition or a condition that causes your muscles to get smaller, such as:\n\n* A long illness\n* A nerve disorder\n* Muscle loss from aging\n* Serious liver disease\n\n**Understanding eGFR, Creatinine Clearance, and Urine Albumin to Creatinine Ratio**\n\nIf your results from creatinine blood or urine tests were used to calculate an eGFR, creatinine clearance, and/or a urine albumin to creatinine ratio, ask your provider to explain what these measurements say about your kidney health.\n\n**Talking to Your Provider**\n\nIf you have questions about any of your results, talk with your provider. They can help you understand what your test results mean and what steps you should take next.\n\n---\n\n**Creatinine Test: Understanding Your Results**\n\nAre you wondering what your creatinine test results mean? This article will help you understand the significance of your test results and how they relate to your kidney health.\n\n**What is Creatinine?**\n\nCreatinine is a waste product in your blood that comes from the normal breakdown of muscle tissue. Your kidneys remove excess creatinine from your blood, so if your kidneys are not functioning properly, creatinine levels will build up in your blood.\n\n**How is a Creatinine Test Performed?**\n\nA creatinine test is usually performed on a sample of blood or urine. The test measures the level of creatinine in your blood or urine to determine how well your kidneys are functioning.\n\n**What Do My Creatinine Test Results Mean?**\n\nYour healthcare provider will use your creatinine test results to assess your kidney function. If your results indicate high levels of creatinine, it may be a sign that your kidneys are not functioning properly.\n\n**Why is a Creatinine Test Important?**\n\nA creatinine test is an important tool for detecting and monitoring kidney disease. By understanding your creatinine test results, you can take steps to protect your kidney health and prevent further complications.\n\n**What Should I Do If I Have Questions About My Creatinine Test Results?**\n\nIf you have questions about your creatinine test results, talk with your healthcare provider. They will help you understand the significance of your results and develop a plan to maintain or improve your kidney function.\n\n**Learn More About Laboratory Tests and Understanding Your Results**\n\nFor more information on laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding your results, visit the following resources:\n\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Chronic Kidney Disease Basics\n* Cleveland Clinic: Health Library: Diagnostics & Testing - Creatinine Clearance Test\n* Gounden V, Bhatt H, Jialal I.

This test is done to see how well your kidneys are working.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nCreatinine is a chemical waste product of creatine. Creatine is a chemical the body makes to supply energy, mainly to muscles.\n\nThis test is done to see how well your kidneys work. Creatinine is removed by the body entirely by the kidneys. If kidney function is not normal, the creatinine level in your urine decreases.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nAfter you provide a urine sample, it is tested in the lab. If needed, your health care provider may ask you to collect your urine at home over 24 hours. Your provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYour provider may tell you to temporarily stop taking certain medicines that may affect test results. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take. These include:\n\n*   Antibiotics such as cefoxitin or trimethoprim\n*   Cimetidine, famotidine, and ranitidine\n\nDo not stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nUrine creatinine (24-hour urine collection) values can range from 500 to 2000 mg/day (4,420 to 17,680 mmol/day).

    "content": "**Creeping Eruption**\n\nCreeping eruption is a human infection with dog or cat hookworm larvae (immature worms).\n\n**Causes**\n\nHookworm eggs are found in the stool of infected dogs and cats. When the eggs hatch, the larvae can infest soil and vegetation.\n\nWhen you come into contact with this infested soil, the larvae can burrow into your skin. They cause an intense inflammatory response that leads to a rash and severe itching.\n\nCreeping eruption is more common in countries with warm climates. In the United States, the Southeast has the highest rates of infection. The main risk factor for this disease is contact with damp, sandy soil that has been contaminated with infected cat or dog stool. More children than adults become infected.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Blisters\n* Itching, may be more severe at night\n* Raised, snakelike tracks in the skin that may spread over time, usually about 1 centimeter (cm) or less than one-half inch (in) per day, usually on the feet and legs (severe infections may cause several tracks)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider can often diagnose this condition by looking at your skin. In rare cases, a skin biopsy is done to check for other conditions.

It typically affects people who have walked barefoot in areas where these worms are common.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of creeping eruption include:\n\n*   A crawling or tingling sensation on the skin\n*   Small, raised bumps or blisters that may be itchy or painful\n*   The larvae can move under the skin, causing a serpentine or linear rash to form\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment**\n\nDiagnosing creeping eruption typically involves identifying the presence of hookworm larvae in the affected area. Treatment usually involves removing the larvae from the skin using a technique called \"larva extraction.\" In some cases, antiparasitic medications may be prescribed to help clear up the infection.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo prevent creeping eruption, it's essential to avoid walking barefoot in areas where hookworms are common. Wearing shoes and socks when outdoors can help reduce the risk of infection. Additionally, keeping pets free of hookworms can also help prevent the spread of the disease.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Topics**\n\n*   Animal Diseases and Your Health\n*   Parasitic Diseases",

    "content": "**Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease**\n\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a form of brain damage that leads to a rapid decrease in movement and loss of mental function.\n\n**Causes**\n\nCJD is caused by a protein called a prion. A prion causes normal proteins to fold abnormally. This affects other proteins' ability to function.\n\nCJD is very rare. There are several types. The classic types of CJD are:\n\n* **Sporadic CJD**: makes up most cases. It occurs for no known reason. It starts on average at age 65 years.\n* **Familial CJD**: occurs when a person inherits the abnormal prion from a parent (this form of CJD is rare).\n* **Acquired CJD**:\n\t+ **Variant CJD (vCJD)**: caused by eating infected meat. The infection that causes the disease in cows is thought to be the same one that causes vCJD in humans.\n\t+ **Iatrogenic CJD**: sometimes passed through a blood product transfusion, transplant, or contaminated surgical instruments.\n\nCJD may be related to several other diseases caused by prions, including:\n\n* Chronic wasting disease (found in deer)\n* Kuru (affected mostly women in New Guinea who ate the brains of dead relatives as part of a funeral ritual)\n* Scrapie (found in sheep)\n* Other very rare inherited human diseases, such as Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease and fatal familial insomnia\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCJD symptoms may include any of the following:\n\n* Dementia that gets worse quickly over a few weeks or months\n* Blurred vision (sometimes)\n* Changes in gait (walking)\n* Confusion, disorientation\n* Hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there)\n* Lack of coordination (for example, stumbling and falling)\n* Muscle stiffness, twitching\n* Feeling nervous, jumpy\n* Personality changes\n* Sleepiness\n* Sudden jerky movements or seizures\n* Trouble speaking\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nEarly in the disease, a nervous system and mental exam will show memory and thinking problems. Later in the disease, a motor system exam (to test muscle reflexes, strength, coordination, and other physical functions) may show:\n\n* Abnormal reflexes or increased normal reflex responses\n* Increase in muscle tone\n* Muscle twitching and spasms\n* Strong startle response\n* Weakness and loss of muscle tissue (muscle wasting)\n\nLoss of coordination occurs due to changes in the cerebellum. This is the area of the brain that controls coordination.\n\nAn eye exam shows areas of blindness that the person may not notice.\n\nTests used to diagnose this condition may include:\n\n* Blood tests to rule out other forms of dementia and to look for markers that may occur with the disease\n* CT scan of the brain\n* Electroencephalogram (EEG)\n* MRI of the brain\n* Spinal tap to test for the abnormal prion protein or for a protein called 14-3-3 in the spinal fluid\n\nThe disease can only be confirmed with a brain biopsy or autopsy.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for this condition. Different medicines have been tried to slow the disease, but none works well.\n\nThe goals of treatment include:\n\n* Provide a safe environment\n* Control aggressive or agitated behavior\n* Make the person comfortable\n* Meet the person's needs\n\nThis may require monitoring and assistance in the home or in a care facility. Family counseling may help the family cope with the changes needed for home care.\n\nPeople with this condition may need help controlling unacceptable or dangerous behaviors. This involves rewarding positive behaviors and ignoring negative behaviors (when it is safe). They may also need help getting oriented to their surroundings. Sometimes, medicines are needed to help control aggression.\n\nIt is helpful for people with CJD and their family to seek legal advice early on. Advance directive, power of attorney, and other legal actions can make it easier to make decisions about the care of the person with CJD.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outcome of CJD is very poor. People with sporadic CJD are unable to care for themselves within 6 months or less after symptoms begin.\n\nThe disorder is fatal in a short time, usually within 8 months. People who have variant CJD get worse more slowly, but the condition is still fatal. A few people survive for as long as 1 or 2 years. The cause of death is usually infection, heart failure, or respiratory failure.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCJD is not a medical emergency. However, early diagnosis and treatment may make the symptoms easier to control, give patients time to make advance directives and prepare for the end of life, and give families extra time to come to terms with the condition.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nMedical equipment that may be contaminated should be removed from service and disposed of. People known to have CJD should not donate a cornea or other body tissue.\n\nMost countries now have strict guidelines for managing infected cows to avoid passing CJD to humans.\n\n---\n\n**Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease**\n\n**Causes**\n\nCJD is caused by a protein called a prion.

The name \"Cri du chat\" is French for \"cry of the cat,\" which describes the high-pitched cry of affected infants.\n\n**Causes and symptoms**\n\nThe cause of Cri du chat syndrome is a deletion of part of the short arm of chromosome 5. This deletion can vary in size, but it usually involves the region around the ELN gene. The symptoms of Cri du chat syndrome are varied and can include:\n\n*   A high-pitched cry that sounds like a cat's meow\n*   Delayed development\n*   Intellectual disability\n*   Heart defects\n*   Cleft palate\n*   Microcephaly (small head size)\n*   Low birth weight\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nCri du chat syndrome can be diagnosed prenatally using amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. After birth, diagnosis is typically made through a combination of physical examination, medical history, and genetic testing.\n\n**Treatment and management**\n\nThere is no cure for Cri du chat syndrome, but treatment and management can help alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. This may include:\n\n*   Speech therapy to address communication difficulties\n*   Physical therapy to improve motor skills\n*   Occupational therapy to enhance daily functioning\n*   Medications to manage related medical conditions\n*   Regular check-ups with a pediatrician or geneticist\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with Cri du chat syndrome varies depending on the severity of their symptoms and the effectiveness of treatment. With proper care and support, many individuals with this condition can lead fulfilling lives.\n\n**References**\n\nBacino CA, Lee B. Cytogenetics.

    "content": "**Cribs and Crib Safety**\n\nChoosing a crib that meets current safety standards is crucial for your baby's well-being. Whether you have a new or old crib, ensure it adheres to the following government safety standards:\n\n* Cribs should not have drop-rails, as they are not safe for babies.\n* Crib parts and hardware must be stronger than in the past.\n\nIf you possess an older crib made before the new safety standards were implemented:\n\n* Check with the maker of the crib to see if they offer hardware to prevent the drop side from moving.\n* Regularly inspect the crib to ensure the hardware is tight and no parts are broken or missing.\n* Verify if your crib has been recalled before using it.\n* Consider purchasing a new crib that meets the current safety standards, if possible.\n\n**Using a Crib**\n\nTo guarantee your baby's safety while sleeping:\n\n* Always use a firm, tight-fitting mattress to prevent entrapment between the mattress and the crib.\n* Perform a crib-safety check to ensure:\n\t+ No missing, loose, broken, or poorly installed screws, brackets, or other hardware on the crib.\n\t+ No cracked or peeling paint.\n\t+ No more than 2 3/8 inches (in) or 6 centimeters (cm) between crib slats, preventing a baby's body from fitting through.\n\t+ No missing or cracked slats.\n\t+ No corner posts over 1/16th in (1.6 millimeters) high to avoid catching on the baby's clothing.\n\t+ No cutouts in the headboard or footboard to prevent the baby's head from getting trapped.\n\n**Safe Bedding for Children**\n\nTo reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS):\n\n* Place your baby on their back on a firm, tight-fitting mattress.\n* Avoid using pillows, bumper pads, quilts, comforters, sheepskins, stuffed toys, or any other object that could suffocate or strangle your baby.\n* Use a sleeper gown to cover your baby instead of a blanket.\n* Ensure your baby's head remains uncovered during sleep.\n\nDo not place your baby on:\n\n* A water bed\n* A sofa\n* A soft mattress\n* A pillow\n* Any other soft surface\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of accidents and ensure your baby sleeps safely.\n\n---\n\n**Cribs and Crib Safety**\n\nWhether new or old, your crib should meet all current government safety standards:\n\n* Cribs should not have drop-rails. They are not safe for babies.\n* Crib parts and hardware must be stronger than in the past.\n\nIf you have an older crib that was made before the new safety standards were put into place:\n\n* Check with the maker of the crib. They may offer hardware to keep the drop side from moving.\n* Check the crib often to make sure the hardware is tight and no parts are broken or missing.\n* Check to see if your crib has been recalled before you use it.\n* Think about buying a new crib that meets the current safety standards, if you can.\n\n**Using a Crib**\n\nRead and follow the directions to set up, use, and care for the crib.\n\n* Never use a crib with loose or missing parts or hardware. If parts are missing, stop using the crib and contact the crib maker for the right parts. Do not replace them with parts from a hardware store.\n* Never place a crib near cords from hanging window blinds, curtains, or drapes. Babies can get caught and strangled in the cords.\n* Hammocks and other swinging devices should not be put onto a crib because they could strangle a baby.\n* Lower the crib mattress before your baby can sit up on their own. The mattress should be at the lowest level before the baby can stand up.\n* Hanging crib toys (mobiles, crib gyms) should be out of the baby's reach.\n* Remove any hanging crib toys when your baby first begins to push up on hands and knees (or when your baby is 5 months old).\n* Children should be taken out of a crib by the time they are 35 in (90 cm) tall.\n\n**Safe Bedding for Children**\n\nThough it is rare, some babies die in their sleep without any known reason. This is known as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\nYou can do many things to keep your baby safe during sleep and reduce the chance of a SIDS death:\n\n* Place your baby on their back on a firm, tight-fitting mattress.\n* Do not use pillows, bumper pads, quilts, comforters, sheepskins, stuffed toys, or any other object that could suffocate or strangle your baby.\n* Use a sleeper gown to cover your baby instead of a blanket.\n* Make sure your baby's head remains uncovered during sleep.\n* Do not place your baby on a water bed, sofa, soft mattress, pillow, or other soft surface.\n\n---\n\n**Cribs and Crib Safety**\n\n\\n\\nWhen it comes to keeping your baby safe during sleep, there are several things you can do to reduce the chance of a SIDS death. One of the most important things is to make sure your baby's crib is safe.\n\n*   **Use a firm mattress**: Do not place your baby on a water bed, sofa, soft mattress, pillow, or other soft surface.\n*   **Keep the crib clean and well-maintained**: Regularly inspect the crib for any damage or wear and tear. Make sure all hardware is securely attached.\n*   **Avoid using soft bedding**: Do not use blankets, pillows, or stuffed toys in your baby's crib.\n\nBy following these simple tips, you can help keep your baby safe during sleep and reduce the risk of SIDS.",

    "content": "**Crisaborole Topical**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCrisaborole is used to treat eczema (atopic dermatitis; a skin condition which causes the skin to be dry and itchy and to sometimes develop red, scaly rashes) in adults and children 3 years of age and older. Crisaborole is in a class of medications called phosphodiesterase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of certain natural substances in the body that cause inflammation.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCrisaborole comes as an ointment to apply to the skin. It is usually applied twice a day. Use crisaborole at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use crisaborole exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nThe ointment is only for use on the skin. Be careful not to get crisaborole ointment in your eyes, mouth, or vagina.\n\nTo use the ointment, follow these steps:\n\n*   Wash your hands with soap and water.\n*   Be sure that the skin in the affected area is dry.\n*   Apply a thin layer of crisaborole ointment to all affected areas of your skin. Rub the ointment into your skin gently and completely.\n*   Wash your hands with soap and water to remove any leftover crisaborole ointment. Do not wash your hands if you are treating them with crisaborole ointment. If a caregiver has applied the ointment, they should wash their hands after applying the ointment.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore using topical crisaborole,\n\n*   tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to crisaborole, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in crisaborole ointment.

    "content": "**Critical Congenital Heart Disease**\n\n_Critical congenital heart disease_ is a term that refers to a group of serious heart defects that are present from birth. These abnormalities result from problems with the formation of one or more parts of the heart during the early stages of embryonic development.\n\n**Description**\n\nCCHD prevents the heart from pumping blood effectively or reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood. As a result, organs and tissues throughout the body do not receive enough oxygen, which can lead to organ damage and life-threatening complications. Individuals with CCHD usually require surgery soon after birth.\n\nAlthough babies with CCHD may appear healthy for the first few hours or days of life, signs and symptoms soon become apparent. These can include:\n\n*   An abnormal heart sound during a heartbeat (heart murmur)\n*   Rapid breathing (tachypnea)\n*   Low blood pressure (hypotension)\n*   Low levels of oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia)\n*   A blue or purple tint to the skin caused by a shortage of oxygen (cyanosis)\n\nIf untreated, CCHD can lead to shock, coma, and death. However, most people with CCHD now survive past infancy due to improvements in early detection, diagnosis, and treatment.\n\n**Long-term Effects**\n\nSome people with treated CCHD have few related health problems later in life. However, long-term effects of CCHD can include:\n\n*   Delayed development\n*   Reduced stamina during exercise\n\nAdults with these heart defects have an increased risk of abnormal heart rhythms, heart failure, sudden cardiac arrest, stroke, and premature death.\n\n**Heart Defects Associated with CCHD**\n\nEach of the heart defects associated with CCHD affects the flow of blood into, out of, or through the heart. Some of the heart defects involve structures within the heart itself, such as the two lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles) or the valves that control blood flow through the heart.\n\nOthers affect the structure of the large blood vessels leading into and out of the heart (including the aorta and pulmonary artery). Still others involve a combination of these structural abnormalities.\n\nPeople with CCHD have one or more specific heart defects. The heart defects classified as CCHD include:\n\n*   Coarctation of the aorta\n*   Double-outlet right ventricle\n*   D-transposition of the great arteries\n*   Ebstein anomaly\n*   Hypoplastic left heart syndrome\n*   Interrupted aortic arch\n*   Pulmonary atresia with intact septum\n*   Single ventricle\n*   Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection\n*   Tetralogy of Fallot\n*   Tricuspid atresia\n*   Truncus arteriosus\n\n---\n\n**Critical Congenital Heart Disease**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Critical Congenital Heart Disease?**\n\nCritical congenital heart disease (CCHD) refers to a group of serious heart defects that are present from birth. These abnormalities result from problems with the formation of one or more parts of the heart during the early stages of embryonic development.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nIn most cases, the cause of CCHD is unknown. A variety of genetic and environmental factors likely contribute to this complex condition. Changes in single genes have been associated with CCHD. Studies suggest that these genes are involved in normal heart development before birth. Most of the identified mutations reduce the amount or function of the protein that is produced from a specific gene, which likely impairs the normal formation of structures in the heart.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms and Signs**\n\nAlthough babies with CCHD may appear healthy for the first few hours or days of life, signs and symptoms soon become apparent. These can include an abnormal heart sound during a heartbeat (heart murmur), rapid breathing (tachypnea), low blood pressure (hypotension), low levels of oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia), and a blue or purple tint to the skin caused by a shortage of oxygen (cyanosis).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment**\n\nCCHD is usually isolated, which means it occurs alone (without signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the body). However, the heart defects associated with CCHD can also occur as part of genetic syndromes that have additional features. Some of these genetic conditions, such as Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, result from changes in the number or structure of particular chromosomes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nSome people with treated CCHD have few related health problems later in life. However, long-term effects of CCHD can include delayed development and reduced stamina during exercise. Adults with these heart defects have an increased risk of abnormal heart rhythms, heart failure, sudden cardiac arrest, stroke, and premature death.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Frequency**\n\nHeart defects are the most common type of birth defect, accounting for more than 30 percent of all infant deaths due to birth defects. CCHD represents some of the most serious types of heart defects. About 7,200 newborns, or 18 per 10,000, in the United States are diagnosed with CCHD each year.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of Heart Defects**\n\nPeople with CCHD have one or more specific heart defects. The heart defects classified as CCHD include coarctation of the aorta, double-outlet right ventricle, D-transposition of the great arteries, Ebstein anomaly, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, interrupted aortic arch, pulmonary atresia with intact septum, single ventricle, total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, tetralogy of Fallot, tricuspid atresia, and truncus arteriosus.\n\n---\n\n**Critical Congenital Heart Disease**\n\n**What is Critical Congenital Heart Disease?**\n\nCritical congenital heart disease (CCHD) is a serious heart defect that can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.\n\n**Causes of CCHD**\n\nIn most cases, the cause of CCHD is unknown. A variety of genetic and environmental factors likely contribute to this complex condition.\n\n*   **Genetic Factors**\n    Changes in single genes have been associated with CCHD. Studies suggest that these genes are involved in normal heart development before birth.\n    Most of the identified mutations reduce the amount or function of the protein that is produced from a specific gene, which likely impairs the normal formation of structures in the heart.\n    Studies have also suggested that having more or fewer copies of particular genes compared with other people, a phenomenon known as copy number variation, may play a role in CCHD.\n*   **Environmental Factors**\n    Potential risk factors that have been studied include exposure to certain chemicals or drugs before birth, viral infections (such as rubella and influenza) that occur during pregnancy, and other maternal illnesses including diabetes and phenylketonuria.\n\n**Genes Associated with CCHD**\n\nThe following genes have been associated with CCHD:\n\n*   **GJA1**\n*   **JAG1**\n*   **MED13L**\n*   **NOTCH1**\n*   Additional Information from NCBI Gene:\n    *   **CFC1**\n    *   **FOXH1**\n    *   **GATA4**\n    *   **GATA6**\n    *   **GDF1**\n    *   **HAND1**\n    *   **NKX2-5**\n    *   **NKX2-6**\n    *   **SMAD6**\n    *   **ZFPM2**\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nMost cases of CCHD are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. However, close relatives (such as siblings) of people with CCHD may have an increased risk of being born with a heart defect compared with people in the general population.\n\n**Additional Features**\n\nCCHD can also occur as part of genetic syndromes that have additional features. Some of these genetic conditions, such as Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, result from changes in the number or structure of particular chromosomes. Other conditions, including Noonan syndrome and Alagille syndrome, result from mutations in single genes.\n\n**Unknown Factors**\n\nAlthough researchers are examining risk factors that may be associated with this complex condition, many of these factors remain unknown.\n\n---\n\n**Critical Congenital Heart Disease**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Risk of Being Born with a Heart Defect**\n\nPeople born with critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) make up about 0.2% of births, which is roughly 8 times the risk compared to people in the general population.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* CCHD\n* Critical Congenital Heart Disease\n* Congenital Heart Defects\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Congenital heart disease\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Congenital heart defects, multiple types, 6\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Ebstein anomaly\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Heterotaxy, visceral, 2, autosomal\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome 2\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Tetralogy of Fallot\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Transposition of the great arteries\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**\n\n* Hypoplastic left heart syndrome\n* Transposition of the great arteries\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n* TOTAL ANOMALOUS PULMONARY VENOUS RETURN 1; TAPVR1\n* COARCTATION OF AORTA\n* EBSTEIN ANOMALY\n* PULMONARY ATRESIA WITH VENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT\n* CONOTRUNCAL HEART MALFORMATIONS; CTHM\n* TETRALOGY OF FALLOT; TOF\n* HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME 1; HLHS1\n* PULMONARY ATRESIA WITH INTACT VENTRICULAR SEPTUM\n* TRICUSPID ATRESIA\n* TRANSPOSITION OF THE GREAT ARTERIES, DEXTRO-LOOPED; DTGA\n* HETEROTAXY, VISCERAL, 2, AUTOSOMAL; HTX2\n* CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS, MULTIPLE TYPES, 6; CHTD6\n* HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME 2; HLHS2\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n* Fahed AC, Gelb BD, Seidman JG, Seidman CE.

While some cases may have a clear familial pattern, many others do not.\n\nRecent studies have shed light on the genetic underpinnings of congenital heart disease. For example, research has identified several genes associated with an increased risk of developing certain types of congenital heart defects.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that genetics is only one piece of the puzzle. Environmental factors, such as maternal health during pregnancy, can also play a significant role in the development of congenital heart disease.\n\nAs our understanding of the genetic and environmental factors involved in congenital heart disease continues to evolve, healthcare providers can better identify individuals at risk and provide appropriate care and support.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**De Novo Mutations in Congenital Heart Disease**\n\nA 2013 study published in Nature found that de novo mutations in histone-modifying genes are associated with an increased risk of congenital heart disease. These findings highlight the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors in the development of congenital heart defects.\n\nThe study's results have significant implications for our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of congenital heart disease and may lead to the development of new diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   Congenital Heart Defects\n*   Genetic Disorders\n*   Newborn Screening",

    "content": "**Crohn Disease Treatment Quiz**\n\n**Part 1/2**\n\n**Crohn disease can involve the:**\nA. Large intestine\nB. Small intestine\nC. Stomach and esophagus\nD. Rectum\nE. Mouth\nF. All of the above\n\nThe correct answer is F. All of the above.\n\nIn people with Crohn disease, the immune system mistakenly attacks the digestive tract--the part of your body that food and waste pass through. This leads to swollen and inflamed tissue, most often in the small intestines. But these changes may occur anywhere from the mouth to the end of the rectum.\n\n**Which is NOT a goal of Crohn disease treatment?**\nA. Pain relief\nB. Weight loss\nC. Reduced inflammation\nD. Improved nutritional intake\n\nThe correct answer is B. Weight loss.\n\nMany people with Crohn disease lose too much weight, either because of poor appetite or poor absorption of nutrients. The goals of treatment are to reduce inflammation, pain, and diarrhea, and to improve nutrition. Tell your doctor if you're losing weight.\n\n**Diet changes are an important part of treating Crohn disease.**\nA. True\nB. False\n\nThe correct answer is A. True.\n\nNo specific diet has been shown to improve Crohn disease in everyone. But you can learn to avoid foods that make your symptoms worse. You should eat a well-balanced diet with enough calories, protein, and essential nutrients. Ask your health care provider to help you plan balanced meals.\n\n**Which is a good food choice for people with Crohn disease?**\nA. Beans\nB. Cabbage\nC. Broccoli\nD. Citrus fruit\nE. None of the above\n\nThe correct answer is E. None of the above.\n\nAll of these foods can cause gas. Because people with Crohn disease are prone to gas, avoiding these foods is a good idea. Talk with your health care provider about which foods are better for people with Crohn disease.\n\n**People with Crohn disease should eat plenty of fiber.**\nA. True\nB. False\n\nThe correct answer is B. False.\n\nToo much fiber may make your symptoms worse. Try baking or stewing fruits and vegetables if eating them raw bothers you. Eat low-fiber foods if that does not help enough. Ask your doctor about any extra vitamins or mineral supplements you may need.\n\n**For mild pain, people with Crohn disease can take:**\nA. Acetaminophen\nB. Aspirin\nC. Ibuprofen\nD. Naproxen\nE. All of the above\n\nThe correct answer is A. Acetaminophen (Tylenol).\n\nIt's best to avoid aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). These medicines may make your symptoms worse. If you have Crohn disease, check with your doctor before taking any over-the-counter medicines.\n\n**Prescription medicines for Crohn disease can:**\nA. Reduce swelling and damage in the digestive tract\nB. Calm the immune system\nC. Both\n\nThe correct answer is C. Both.\n\nSome medicines reduce inflammation in the intestines, which can relieve pain and diarrhea. Others keep the immune system from attacking the digestive tract. These medicines can have serious side effects, so talk to your doctor about the pros and cons.\n\n---\n\n**Crohn Disease Treatment Quiz**\n\n\\n\\nThese medicines can have serious side effects, so talk to your doctor about the pros and cons.\n\n*   **Biologic therapy may help when other treatments don't provide enough relief.**\n    *   True\n    *   False\n    The correct answer is true. Biologic therapies are given by injection. Your doctor may recommend biologic therapy if other medicines don't reduce inflammation enough or if you develop certain complications.\n\n\\n\\nSurgery to remove part of the intestine will cure Crohn disease.\n\n*   True\n*   False\nThe correct answer is false. Some people with Crohn disease may need surgery to remove a damaged part of the intestine or rectum. This can correct bleeding, blockages, and other serious intestinal problems. But it is not a cure. Discuss the risks and benefits of surgery with your doctor.\n\n\\n\\nPatients with Crohn disease who smoke are more likely to need surgery.\n\n*   True\n*   False\nThe correct answer is true. Smoking can make Crohn symptoms worse and increase the chances of needing surgery. Quitting smoking can make Crohn disease less severe. Ask your doctor about strategies that can help you quit.\n\n\\n\\nWhat else can help manage Crohn disease?\n\n*   A. Reducing stress\n*   B. Getting enough rest\n*   C. Joining a support group\n*   D. All of the above\n\nThe correct answer is all of the above. Stress can make Crohn symptoms worse, so it's important to find ways to relax. You may find it helpful to join a support group. The Crohn and Colitis Foundation offers support groups throughout the United States.",

Talk with your child's provider about activities and exercises your child can do.\n* Simple things such as doing yoga or tai chi, listening to music, relaxation exercises, meditation, reading, or soaking in a warm bath can relax your child and help reduce stress.\n* Have your child see a counselor who can help them gain self-confidence.\n* Be alert if your child is losing interest in school, friends, and activities. If you think your child may be depressed, talk with a mental health counselor.\n\nYou may want to join a support group to help you and your child manage the disease. Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) is one of such groups. CCFA offers a list of resources, a database of doctors who specialize in treating Crohn disease, information about local support groups, and a website for teens - www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/patientsandcaregivers/justlikeme.\n\n**Medicines**\n\nYour child's provider may give your child medicine to help relieve symptoms. The provider may give one or more of the following medicines based on the severity of your child's Crohn disease and how your child responds to treatment:\n\n---\n\n**Crohn Disease in Children - Discharge**\n\nWhen your child is discharged from the hospital after being treated for Crohn disease, it's essential to understand their treatment plan and how to manage their symptoms at home. In this article, we'll discuss the importance of medication adherence, lifestyle changes, and when to contact a healthcare provider.\n\n**Medication Adherence**\n\nYour child's provider may prescribe one or more medications to help relieve symptoms based on the severity of their Crohn disease and how they respond to treatment. These medications can include:\n\n*   Anti-diarrhea medicines like loperamide (Imodium) to help with bad diarrhea\n*   Fiber supplements such as psyllium powder (Metamucil) or methylcellulose (Citrucel) to help regulate bowel movements\n*   Acetaminophen for mild pain, while avoiding medications like aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen that may worsen symptoms\n\nIt's crucial to discuss any concerns or questions you have with your child's provider before starting or switching medications.\n\n**Lifestyle Changes**\n\nIn addition to medication adherence, there are several lifestyle changes you can make to help manage your child's Crohn disease:\n\n*   **Talk to your child about medicine**: Help them understand the use of their medication and how it will help alleviate symptoms.\n*   **Teach your child how to take their medicine**: If they're old enough, teach them how to properly administer their medication.\n\nBy working closely with your child's provider and making these lifestyle changes, you can help ensure their Crohn disease is effectively managed and they can live a comfortable, healthy life.\n\n**When to Contact a Healthcare Provider**\n\nIf your child is taking medications that suppress the immune system, it's essential to schedule regular check-ups with their provider every 3 months to monitor for any potential complications. You should contact their provider if they experience:\n\n*   Cramps or pain in the lower stomach area that persists\n*   Bloody diarrhea with mucus or pus\n*   Diarrhea that cannot be controlled with diet changes and medications\n*   Rectal bleeding, drainage, or sores\n*   New rectal pain\n*   Fever lasting more than 2-3 days or exceeding 100.4°F (38°C) without an explanation\n*   Nausea and vomiting lasting more than a day\n*   Skin sores or lesions that don't heal\n*   Joint pain affecting daily activities\n*   A feeling of having little warning before needing to have a bowel movement\n*   Needing to wake up from sleep to have a bowel movement\n*   Failure to gain weight, especially for growing infants or children\n*   Side effects from any prescribed medications\n\nBy being aware of these potential complications and knowing when to contact their provider, you can help ensure your child receives the necessary care to manage their Crohn disease effectively.\n\n---\n\n**Discharge Instructions for Children with Crohn Disease**\n\nYou've been discharged from the hospital after being treated for Crohn disease. This is a chronic condition that affects the digestive system, causing inflammation and damage to the lining of the intestines.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\n*   You may experience symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue, and loss of appetite.\n*   Your child's bowel movements may be frequent or infrequent, and they may have blood in their stool.\n*   As your child recovers, you can expect their symptoms to improve, but it's essential to continue treatment to manage the disease.\n\n**Medications**\n\nYour child will likely be prescribed medications to control inflammation, suppress the immune system, and maintain bowel function. These may include:\n\n*   Aminosalicylates (e.g., sulfasalazine) to reduce inflammation\n*   Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) to suppress inflammation and swelling\n*   Immunomodulators (e.g., azathioprine) to modify the immune system's response\n*   Biologics (e.g., infliximab) to target specific proteins involved in inflammation\n\n**Dietary Changes**\n\nTo manage Crohn disease, your child should follow a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. They may need to avoid certain foods that trigger symptoms or worsen the condition.\n\n**Follow-up Care**\n\nRegular follow-up appointments with your child's healthcare provider are crucial to monitor their response to treatment, adjust medication as needed, and address any concerns or questions you may have.\n\n**When to Seek Medical Attention**\n\nIf your child experiences any of the following, seek medical attention immediately:\n\n*   Severe abdominal pain\n*   Vomiting blood or black tarry stools\n*   Fever above 101.5°F (38.6°C)\n*   Signs of dehydration (e.g., excessive thirst, dark urine)\n\nBy working closely with your child's healthcare provider and following their treatment plan, you can help manage Crohn disease and improve their quality of life.\n\n**Review Date:** August 12, 2024\n\n**Updated by:** Jenifer K.

This is an inflammation of the surface and deep layers of the small intestine, large intestine, or both.\n\n**When You're in the Hospital**\n\n*   You may have had exams, lab tests, stool tests, and imaging tests such as CT or MRI.\n*   The inside of your colon (large intestine) and ileum (last part of the small bowel) may have been examined using a flexible tube (colonoscopy).\n*   A sample of your tissue (biopsy) may have been taken.\n*   You may have been asked not to eat or drink anything and have been fed only through an intravenous line.\n*   You may have received special nutrients through a feeding tube.\n*   You may have also started taking new medicines to treat your Crohn disease.\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nAfter a flare-up of your Crohn disease, you may be more tired and have less energy than before. This should get better. Ask your health care provider about any side effects from your new medicines. You should see your provider regularly. You may also need follow-up blood and stool tests, especially if you are on new medicines.\n\n**Diet**\n\nWhen you first go home, you may be asked to drink only liquids or eat different foods from what you normally eat. Ask your provider when you can start your regular diet.\n\nYou should eat a well-balanced, healthy diet. It is important that you get enough calories, protein, and important nutrients from a variety of food groups.\n\nCertain foods and drinks can make your symptoms worse. These foods may cause problems for you all the time or only during a flare-up. Try to avoid foods that make your symptoms worse.\n\n*   If your body does not digest dairy foods well, limit dairy products.\n*   Try low-lactose cheeses, such as Swiss and cheddar, or an enzyme product, such as Lactaid, to help break down lactose.\n*   If you must stop eating dairy products, talk with a dietitian about getting enough calcium. Some experts believe that you should avoid dairy products altogether until you are tolerating your regular diet.\n\nToo much fiber may make your symptoms worse. Try baking or stewing fruits and vegetables if eating them raw bothers you. Eat low-fiber foods if that does not help enough.\n\nIf you have a narrowing of the bowel, you may be put on a low-residue diet. Your provider or a dietitian may be helpful to understand this diet.\n\nAvoid foods that are known to cause gas, such as beans, spicy food, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, raw fruit juices, and fruits, especially citrus fruits.\n\nAvoid or limit alcohol and caffeine. They may make your diarrhea worse.\n\nEat smaller meals, and eat more often. Drink plenty of liquids.\n\nAsk your provider about extra vitamins and minerals you may need:\n\n*   Iron supplements (if you have iron deficiency anemia). Sometimes iron is given intravenously.\n*   Nutritional supplements. Because Crohn disease can cause poor absorption, certain vitamin levels may be low and you may need to supplement. Follow your provider's recommendations.\n*   Calcium and vitamin D supplements to help keep your bones strong.\n*   Vitamin B-12 shots, to prevent anemia.\n\nTalk with a dietitian, especially if you lose weight or your diet becomes very limited.\n\n**Stress**\n\nYou may feel worried about having a bowel accident, embarrassed, or even feel sad or depressed. Other stressful events in your life, such as moving, job loss, or the loss of a loved one, can cause problems with your digestion.\n\nThese tips help you to manage your Crohn disease:\n\n*   Join a support group. Ask your provider about groups in your area.\n*   Exercise. Talk with your provider about an exercise plan that is right for you.\n*   Try biofeedback to reduce muscle tension and slow your heart rate, deep breathing exercises, hypnosis, or other ways to relax. Examples include doing yoga, listening to music, meditation, reading, or soaking in a warm bath.\n*   See a mental health professional for help if necessary.\n\n**Drug Treatment**\n\nYour provider may give you some medicines to help relieve your symptoms.

It most often involves the lower end of the small intestine and the beginning of the large intestine.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of Crohn disease is unknown, but it's believed to be an autoimmune disorder, where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in the digestive tract. Factors that may play a role include:\n\n*   **Genetics**: People with a family history of Crohn disease are more likely to develop the condition.\n*   **Environmental factors**: Smoking, stress, and certain medications may trigger or worsen symptoms.\n*   **Imbalanced gut bacteria**: An overreaction to normal bacteria in the intestines can contribute to inflammation.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCrohn disease can cause a range of symptoms, including:\n\n*   **Abdominal pain**: Crampy pain in the belly area\n*   **Fever**: A persistent fever is common in Crohn disease\n*   **Fatigue**: Feeling tired or exhausted due to chronic inflammation\n*   **Loss of appetite**: Reduced interest in food can lead to weight loss\n*   **Diarrhea**: Watery stools, which may be bloody\n\nOther symptoms may include:\n\n*   **Constipation**\n*   **Sores or swelling in the eyes**\n*   **Draining of pus, mucus, or stools from around the rectum or anus (fistula)**\n*   **Joint pain and swelling**\n*   **Mouth ulcers**\n*   **Rectal bleeding and bloody stools**\n*   **Swollen gums**\n*   **Tender, red bumps (nodules) under the skin, which may turn into skin ulcers**\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nA diagnosis of Crohn disease is typically made through a combination of:\n\n*   **Physical exam**: A doctor may perform a physical examination to check for signs of inflammation or other complications.\n*   **Imaging tests**: Barium enema, upper GI series, colonoscopy, CT scan, capsule endoscopy, MRI of the abdomen, and enteroscopy may be used to visualize the digestive tract.\n*   **Blood tests**: To check for signs of inflammation, anemia, or other complications.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nWhile there is no cure for Crohn disease, treatment aims to manage symptoms, induce remission, and prevent complications. Treatment options include:\n\n*   **Dietary changes**: Eating a well-balanced diet, avoiding trigger foods, and staying hydrated.\n*   **Medications**: Aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, antibiotics, immunomodulators, biologics, and other medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms and induce remission.\n*   **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove damaged or diseased tissue.\n\n**Complications**\n\nCrohn disease increases the risk of developing certain complications, including:\n\n*   **Small bowel and colon cancer**\n*   **Abscess or infection in the intestines**\n*   **Anemia**\n*   **Bowel blockage**\n*   **Fistulas in the bladder, skin, or vagina**\n*   **Slow growth and sexual development in children**\n*   **Swelling of the joints**\n*   **Lack of important nutrients**\n*   **Problems with maintaining a healthy weight**\n*   **Swelling of the bile ducts (primary sclerosing cholangitis)**\n*   **Skin lesions, such as pyoderma gangrenosum**\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf you experience any of the following, contact your provider:\n\n*   **Severe abdominal pain**\n*   **Fever above 101.5°F (38.6°C)**\n*   **Blood in stool or vomit**\n*   **Difficulty swallowing**\n*   **Nausea and vomiting**\n*   **Loss of appetite**\n*   **Weight loss**\n\nEarly detection and treatment can help manage symptoms, prevent complications, and improve quality of life for individuals with Crohn disease.\n\n---\n\n**Crohn Disease**\n\n_Crohn's disease; Inflammatory bowel disease - Crohn's disease; Regional enteritis; Ileitis; Granulomatous ileocolitis; IBD - Crohn disease_\n\n**What is Crohn Disease?**\n\nCrohn disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that affects the digestive tract. It most often involves the lower end of the small intestine and the beginning of the large intestine, but can occur in any part of the digestive system from the mouth to the anus.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of Crohn disease is unknown, but it is believed to be an autoimmune disorder, where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. Factors that may play a role include:\n\n* Genetics and family history\n* Environmental factors\n* Tendency to over-react to normal bacteria in the intestines\n* Smoking\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of Crohn disease can vary depending on the part of the digestive tract involved, but common symptoms include:\n\n* Crampy abdominal pain\n* Fever\n* Fatigue\n* Loss of appetite and weight loss\n* Diarrhea, which may be bloody\n* Constipation\n* Sores or swelling in the eyes\n* Draining of pus, mucus, or stools from around the rectum or anus (fistula)\n* Joint pain and swelling\n* Mouth ulcers\n* Rectal bleeding and bloody stools\n* Swollen gums\n* Tender, red bumps under the skin\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nDiagnosing Crohn disease typically involves a physical exam, as well as various tests such as:\n\n* Barium enema or upper GI series\n* Colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy (often with biopsy)\n* CT scan of the abdomen\n* Capsule endoscopy\n* MRI of the abdomen\n* Enteroscopy\n\n**Treatment**\n\nManaging Crohn disease at home involves a well-balanced diet, including enough calories, protein, and nutrients from various food groups. Some foods can make diarrhea and gas worse, so it's best to:\n\n* Eat small amounts of food throughout the day\n* Drink lots of water\n* Avoid high-fiber foods (bran, beans, nuts, seeds, and popcorn)\n* Limit dairy products if you have problems digesting dairy fats\n* Avoid spicy foods\n\nAdditionally, your healthcare provider may recommend extra vitamins and minerals, such as iron supplements, calcium and vitamin D supplements to keep bones strong, or vitamin B12 to prevent anemia. If you have an ileostomy, you'll need to learn how to change your pouch and care for your stoma.\n\n**Stress Management**\n\nManaging stress is also important in managing Crohn disease. Your healthcare provider can offer tips on how to manage stress, which can worsen digestive problems.\n\n**Medicines**\n\nYou may be prescribed medicine to treat very bad diarrhea or other symptoms. Always talk to your provider before using these medicines.\n\n---\n\n**Crohn Disease**\n\n_Crohn disease is a disease where parts of the digestive tract become inflamed._\n\nIt most often involves the lower end of the small intestine and the beginning of the large intestine.\n\nIt may also occur in any part of the digestive system from the mouth to the end of the rectum (anus).\n\n**Causes**\n\n_The exact cause of Crohn disease is unknown.

Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n**DIET AND NUTRITION**\n\n*   Eat a well-balanced, healthy diet that includes enough calories, protein, and nutrients from a variety of food groups.\n*   Avoid specific foods that trigger diarrhea and gas, such as high-fiber foods (bran, beans, nuts, seeds, and popcorn), fatty, greasy or fried foods and sauces (butter, margarine, and heavy cream), dairy products if you have problems digesting dairy fats, and spicy foods.\n*   Consider taking extra vitamins and minerals, such as iron supplements if you are iron deficient, calcium and vitamin D supplements to help keep your bones strong, and vitamin B12 to prevent anemia.\n\n**STRESS**\n\n*   Manage stress by engaging in relaxing activities, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises.\n*   Seek support from friends, family, or a therapist if you're struggling with anxiety or depression.\n\n**MEDICINES**\n\n*   Take medicine as directed by your healthcare provider to treat diarrhea, pain, and other symptoms.\n*   Consider taking fiber supplements, such as psyllium powder (Metamucil) or methylcellulose (Citrucel), under the guidance of your healthcare provider.\n\n---\n\n**Crohn Disease**\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nYou have more risk for small bowel and colon cancer if you have Crohn disease. Your provider may suggest tests to screen for colon cancer. A colonoscopy is often recommended if you have had Crohn disease involving the colon for 8 or more years.\n\nThose with more severe Crohn disease may have these problems:\n\n* Abscess or infection in the intestines\n* Anemia, a lack of red blood cells\n* Bowel blockage\n* Fistulas in the bladder, skin, or vagina\n* Slow growth and sexual development in children\n* Swelling of the joints\n* Lack of important nutrients, such as vitamin B12 and iron\n* Problems with maintaining a healthy weight\n* Swelling of the bile ducts (primary sclerosing cholangitis)\n* Skin lesions, such as pyoderma gangrenosum\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you:\n\n* Have very bad abdominal pain\n* Cannot control your diarrhea with diet changes and drugs\n* Have lost weight, or your child with Crohn disease is not gaining weight\n* Have rectal bleeding, drainage, or sores\n* Have a fever that lasts for more than 2 or 3 days, or a fever higher than 100.4°F (38°C) without an illness\n* Have nausea and vomiting that lasts for more than a day\n* Have skin sores that do not heal\n* Have joint pain that prevents you from doing your everyday activities\n* Have side effects from medicines you are taking for your condition\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCrohn's disease; Inflammatory bowel disease - Crohn's disease; Regional enteritis; Ileitis; Granulomatous ileocolitis; IBD - Crohn disease\n\n---\n\n**Part 7/7: Diagnosis and Treatment of Crohn's Disease**\n\nIn this final part of our comprehensive guide to Crohn's disease, we will delve into the diagnosis and treatment of this debilitating condition.\n\n**Diagnosis of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases**\n\nThe diagnosis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) is a crucial step in managing Crohn's disease. According to Kaplan GG and Ng SC, \"the diagnosis of IBDs involves a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and endoscopic procedures\" (Feldman et al., 2021).\n\n**Treatment of Crohn's Disease**\n\nThe treatment of Crohn's disease is multifaceted and often requires a combination of medications, lifestyle changes, and surgical interventions. Lichtenstein GR notes that \"the goal of treatment is to induce and maintain remission, prevent complications, and improve quality of life\" (Goldman et al., 2024).\n\n**Medications for Crohn's Disease**\n\nVarious medications are used to treat Crohn's disease, including aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologics, and antibiotics. Feuerstein JD and Ho EY recommend that \"patients with moderate to severe luminal and perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease should be treated with a combination of medications, including aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and biologics\" (Gastroenterology, 2021).\n\n**Surgical Interventions**\n\nIn some cases, surgical interventions may be necessary to treat complications of Crohn's disease. Cameron J notes that \"large bowel resection may be indicated for patients with severe disease or complications such as fistulas or abscesses\" (Cameron et al., 2023).\n\n**Lifestyle Changes**\n\nLifestyle changes can also play a crucial role in managing Crohn's disease. Patients are often advised to follow a bland diet, avoid triggers that exacerbate symptoms, and engage in stress-reducing activities.\n\n**Test Your Knowledge: Crohn Disease Treatment Quiz**\n\nTake our quiz to test your knowledge on the diagnosis and treatment of Crohn's disease!\n\n---\n\nUpdated by Michael M.

Treatments include medicines, bowel rest, and surgery. No single treatment works for everyone. You and your provider can work together to figure out which treatment is best for you:\n\n**Medicines for Crohn's**\n\nMedicines for Crohn's include various medicines that decrease the inflammation. Many of these medicines do this by reducing the activity of your immune system. Certain medicines can also help with symptoms or complications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anti-diarrheal medicines. If your Crohn's causes an infection, you may need antibiotics.\n\n**Bowel Rest**\n\nBowel rest involves drinking only certain liquids or not eating or drinking anything. This allows your intestines to rest. You may need to do this if your Crohn's disease symptoms are severe. You get your nutrients through drinking a liquid, a feeding tube, or an intravenous (IV) tube. You may need to do bowel rest in the hospital, or you may be able to do it at home. It will last for a few days or up to several weeks.\n\n**Surgery**\n\nSurgery can treat complications and reduce symptoms when other treatments are not helping enough. The surgery will involve removing a damaged part of your digestive tract to treat:\n\n* Fistulas\n* Bleeding that is life threatening\n* Intestinal obstructions\n* Side effects from medicines when they threaten your health\n* Symptoms when medicines do not improve your condition\n\n**Dietary Changes**\n\nChanging your diet can help reduce symptoms.

Talk to your child's health care provider if croup lasts longer than a week or comes back often.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour provider will take a medical history and ask about your child's symptoms. Your provider will examine your child's chest to check for:\n\n* Difficulty breathing in and out\n* Whistling sound (wheezing)\n* Decreased breath sounds\n* Chest retractions with breathing\n\nAn exam of the throat may reveal a red epiglottis. In a few cases, x-rays or other tests may be needed.\n\nA neck x-ray may reveal a foreign object or narrowing of the trachea.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nMost cases of croup can be safely managed at home with telephone support from your provider. However, if you are worried about your child's symptoms, you should call your provider for advice, even in the middle of the night.\n\nSteps you can take at home include:\n\n* Expose your child to cool or moist air, such as in a steamy bathroom or outside in the cool night air.\n* Set up a cool air vaporizer in the child's bedroom and use it for a few nights.\n* Make your child more comfortable by giving acetaminophen. This medicine also lowers a fever so the child will not have to breathe as hard.\n* Avoid cough medicines unless you discuss them with your provider first.\n\nYour provider may prescribe medicines, such as:\n\n* Steroid medicines taken by mouth or through an inhaler\n* Antibiotic medicine (for some, but not most cases)\n\nYour child may need to be treated in the emergency room or to stay in the hospital if they:\n\n* Have breathing problems that do not go away or get worse\n* Become too tired because of breathing problems\n* Have bluish skin color\n* Are not drinking enough fluids\n\nMedicines and treatments used at the hospital may include:\n\n* Breathing medicines given with a nebulizer machine\n* Steroid medicines given through a vein (IV)\n* An oxygen tent placed over a crib\n* Fluids given through a vein for dehydration\n* Antibiotics given through a vein\n\nRarely, a breathing tube through the nose or mouth will be needed to help your child breathe.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nCroup is most often mild, but it can still be dangerous. It most often goes away in 3 to 7 days.\n\nIn some severe cases of croup that does not require emergency department care, a short course of oral glucocorticoids (steroids) may be useful to reduce swelling and improve symptoms.\n\nThe tissue that covers the trachea (windpipe) is called the epiglottis. If the epiglottis becomes infected, the entire windpipe can swell shut. This is a life-threatening condition.\n\nIf an airway blockage is not treated promptly, the child can have severe trouble breathing or breathing may stop completely.\n\n---\n\n**Croup**\n\n_Catégorie : général_\n\n_Symptômes_\n\nLes symptômes de la croup sont :\n\n*   Un son rauque ou un bruit de gorge lorsqu'on respire\n*   Une respiration difficile ou une difficulté à respirer\n*   Des crachats ou des écoulements nasaux\n\n_Causes_\n\nLa croup est causée par une infection virale qui affecte les voies respiratoires supérieures.

    "content": "**Crutches and Children - Proper Fit and Safety Tips**\n\nAfter surgery or an injury, your child may need crutches to walk. Your child needs crutches for support so that no weight or only partial weight is put on your child's leg. Using crutches isn't easy and takes practice. Make sure that your child's crutches fit right and learn some safety tips.\n\n**Fitting Crutches**\n\nAsk your child's health care provider to fit the crutches to your child. Proper fit makes using crutches easier and keeps your child from getting hurt when using them. Even if your child is fitted for their crutches:\n\n*   Keep the rubber caps on the underarm pads, handgrips, and feet.\n*   Adjust the crutches to the right length. With the crutches upright and your child standing up straight, make sure you can put 2 fingers or an inch between your child's underarm and the top of the crutches. They should not be leaning on the crutches against the underarm pads. Crutch pads against the armpit can give your child a rash and put pressure on nerves and blood vessels in the arm. Too much pressure can damage nerves and blood vessels.\n*   Adjust the height of the handgrips. They should be where your child's wrists are when their arms are hanging by their side or hip. The elbows should be gently bent when standing up and holding the handgrips without the crutches touching the armpits.\n*   Make sure your child's elbows are slightly bent when starting to use the crutch, then extended when taking a step.\n\n**Safety Tips**\n\nTeach your child to:\n\n*   Always keep crutches nearby in easy reach.\n*   Wear shoes that do not slip off, avoiding, for example, slippers or flip flops.\n*   Move slowly. The crutch may get caught on something or slip when you try to move too quickly.\n*   Watch for slippery walking surface. Leaves, ice, and snow are all slippery. Slipping is not generally a problem on wet roads or sidewalks if the crutches have rubber tips. But wet crutch tips on indoor floors can be very slippery.\n*   Never hang on the crutches. This puts pressure on the arm nerve and can cause damage.\n*   Carry a backpack or fanny pack with necessities. This way things are easy to reach and out of the way.\n\n**Things Parents Can Do**\n\nPut away things in your home that could cause your child to trip. This includes electrical cords, toys, throw rugs, and clothes on the floor.\n\nTalk to your child's school to give your child extra time to go between classes and to avoid crowds in the hallway. See if your child can ask for permission to use the elevators and avoid stairs.\n\nCheck the crutch feet for tread. Make sure they are not slippery.\n\nCheck the screws on the crutches every few days. They get loose easily.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact the provider if your child does not seem safe on crutches even after practicing with you. The provider can refer you to a physical therapist who can teach your child how to use crutches.\n\nIf your child complains of numbing, tingling, or loss of feeling in their arm or hand, contact the provider.\n\n---\n\n**Crutches and Children - Proper Fit and Safety Tips**\n\nAfter surgery or an injury, your child may need crutches to walk.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the following:\n\n*   A child should be able to stand with their feet shoulder-width apart and their hands on the handrails without bending their elbows.\n*   The top of the crutch should reach the middle of the child's shin bone when they are standing up straight.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Safety Tips for Children Using Crutches**\n\nTo ensure children using crutches stay safe, parents or caregivers should:\n\n*   Supervise children closely when they're using crutches to prevent falls and injuries.\n*   Encourage children to walk with their crutches in a stable environment, such as on a flat surface indoors.\n*   Teach children how to properly use their crutches, including how to stand up straight, keep their weight evenly distributed, and avoid overreaching.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\nFor more information on proper fit and safety tips for crutches in children, consult the following resources:\n\n*   Edelstein J.

Learn how to help your child take stairs safely.\n\n**Taking Stairs with Crutches**\n\n*   Teach your child to put their weight on the uninjured foot and leg when going up or down stairs.\n*   Walk behind your child when going up stairs, and walk in front of your child when going down stairs.\n*   Your child may find it easier to scoot up and down the steps. Using their hands and good foot, your child can scoot up or down the stairs using the bottom. This can be a better method for younger children.\n\n**Going Up Stairs**\n\n1.  Put the good foot on the step and push up.\n2.  Push down hard on the crutches to help lift up too.\n3.  Lift the crutches and the bad leg up to the step. Both legs and crutches are on the same step now.\n4.  Do it one step at a time.\n5.  Repeat this until completely up the stairs.\n\n**Going Down Stairs**\n\n1.  Lower the crutches to the step in front.\n2.  Put the bad leg out in front.\n3.  Balance on the crutches (or handrails) and hop or step down with the good foot. Keep the bad foot out in front.\n4.

    "content": "**Crutches and Children - Standing and Walking**\n\nHelp your child learn how to stand and walk safely with crutches.\n\n**Standing with Crutches**\n\nYour child has to be able to balance a little to stand with crutches. Tell your child to hold their head high and look forward, keeping their shoulders back and their stomach and buttocks tucked in. Looking down can cause imbalance and they can run into obstacles. Have your child stand on their good leg. Keep the crutches slightly forward and apart.\n\n**Walking with Crutches (No Weight Bearing on Hurt Foot or Leg)**\n\nThis means that your child cannot put any weight on the hurt foot or leg. The arms, hands, crutches, and good foot are used to move about. Tell your child to:\n\n* Stand on the good foot.\n* Hold the crutches against the side of their body. Squeeze them using the arms and side of body.\n* Move the crutches about one step in front, with the crutches out a little wider than their feet. Move the hurt leg forward with the crutches.\n* Push down on the crutches with their hands on the handgrips. Squeeze the crutches between the arms and sides.\n* Put their weight on the handgrips and move forward.\n* Do not lean on the crutches or their armpits. Putting weight on the armpits can hurt, and your child can get a rash and damage nerves and blood vessels under their arm.\n* Hop forward on the good foot just a little in front of the crutches. This is one step. This should be the distance of a normal step.\n* Start the next step by moving the crutches about one step in front with the injured leg.\n* Look ahead when walking, not at their feet. You can lose balance when looking down.\n\n**Walking with Crutches (Partial Weight Bearing)**\n\nThis means that your child can touch the ground with their bad foot to help with balance. Tell your child to:\n\n* Stand on their good foot.\n* Move the crutches about one step in front.\n* Put their bad leg forward with the crutch tips. Their toes can touch the ground, or a little weight can be put on their foot for balance.\n* Put most of the weight on the handgrips.

    "content": "**Crying in Childhood**\n\nChildren cry for many reasons. Crying is an emotional response to a distressing experience or situation. The degree of a child's distress depends on the child's developmental level and past experiences. Children cry when they feel pain, fear, sadness, frustration, confusion, anger, and when they cannot express their feelings.\n\n**Crying as a Normal Response**\n\nCrying is a normal response to upsetting situations that a child cannot resolve. When the child's coping skills are used up, crying is automatic and natural.\n\n**Teaching Children to Express Feelings**\n\nOver time, a child learns to express feelings of frustration, anger, or confusion without crying. Parents may need to set guidelines to help the child develop appropriate behaviors.\n\n* Praise the child for not crying until the right time and place.\n* Teach other responses to distressing situations.\n* Encourage children to use their words to explain what is upsetting them.\n\n**Developmental Differences**\n\nAs children develop more coping and problem-solving skills, they will cry less often. As they mature, boys tend to cry less than girls. Many believe this difference between boys and girls is a learned behavior.\n\n**Temper Tantrums**\n\nTemper tantrums are unpleasant and disruptive behaviors or emotional outbursts. They often occur in response to unmet needs or desires. Tantrums are more likely to occur in younger children or in children who cannot express their needs or control their emotions when they are frustrated.\n\n**References**\n\n* American Academy of Pediatrics website.

It serves as a means of communication, helping them express their needs and emotions. In the first few months of life, crying is often a response to hunger, thirst, or discomfort. As children develop, they learn to associate crying with specific needs, such as being changed or fed.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Crying**\n\nCrying can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n*   **Physical Discomfort**: Hunger, thirst, soiled diapers, or discomfort due to clothing or environment.\n*   **Emotional Distress**: Frustration, anger, or sadness in response to situations or interactions.\n*   **Overstimulation**: Too much noise, light, or activity can overwhelm a child's senses.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Parental Response**\n\nParents play a crucial role in responding to their child's crying. A calm and empathetic approach helps children feel secure and understood. This may involve:\n\n*   **Validation**: Recognizing and acknowledging the child's emotions.\n*   **Empathy**: Showing understanding and compassion towards the child's feelings.\n*   **Problem-Solving**: Identifying and addressing the underlying cause of the crying.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n*   Consolini DM.

    "content": "**Crying in Infancy**\n\nInfants have a cry reflex that is a normal response to stimuli, such as pain or hunger. Premature infants may not have a cry reflex. Therefore, they must be monitored closely for signs of hunger and pain.\n\n**Information**\n\nA cry is the infant's first verbal communication. It is a message of urgency or distress. The sound is nature's way of ensuring that adults attend to the baby as quickly as possible. It is very hard for most people to listen to a crying baby.\n\nAlmost everyone recognizes that infants cry for many reasons and that crying is a normal response. However, parents may feel a high amount of stress and anxiety when a baby cries frequently. The sound is perceived as an alarm. Parents are often frustrated at not being able to determine the cause of the crying and soothe the baby. First time parents often question their parenting abilities if a baby cannot be comforted.\n\n**Why Infants Cry**\n\nAt times, infants cry for no apparent reason. However, most crying is in response to something. It may be hard to figure out what is bothering the infant at the time. Some possible reasons include:\n\n*   Hunger. Newborns want to eat day and night, often every 2 to 3 hours.\n*   Pain caused by gas or intestinal spasms after feedings. The pain develops if the baby has been fed too much or not burped enough. Foods that a breastfeeding mother eats may cause gas or pain in her child.\n*   Colic. Many infants age 3 weeks to 3 months develop a crying pattern associated with colic. Colic is a normal part of development that may be triggered by many factors. It usually occurs in the late afternoon or evening hours.\n*   Discomfort, such as from a wet diaper.\n*   Feeling too hot or too cold. Babies may also cry from feeling too wrapped up in their blanket, or from wanting to be bundled up tightly.\n*   Too much noise, light, or activity. These can slowly or suddenly overwhelm your baby.\n\nCrying is probably part of the normal development of the central nervous system. Many parents say they can hear a difference in tone between a cry for feeding and a cry caused by pain.\n\n**What to Do When a Baby is Crying**\n\nWhen you are not sure why your baby is crying, first try to eliminate the sources that you can take care of:\n\n*   Make sure the baby is breathing easily and the fingers, toes, and lips are pink and warm.\n*   Check for swelling, redness, wetness, rashes, cold fingers and toes, twisted arms or legs, folded earlobes, or pinched fingers or toes.\n*   Make sure the baby is not hungry. Do not delay for long when your baby shows signs of hunger.\n*   Make sure you are feeding the child the proper amount and burping the baby correctly.\n*   Check to see that your baby is not too cold or too hot.\n*   Check to see whether the baby's diaper needs to be changed.\n*   Make sure there is not too much noise, light, or wind, or not enough stimulation and interaction.\n\nHere are a few ways to soothe a crying baby:\n\n*   Try playing soft, gentle music for comfort.\n*   Talk to your baby. The sound of your voice may be reassuring. Your baby may also be calmed by the hum or sound of a fan or clothes dryer.\n*   Change the infant's position.\n*   Hold your baby close to your chest. Sometimes, infants need to experience familiar sensations, such as the sound of your voice in your chest, your heartbeat, the feel of your skin, the smell of your breath, the movement of your body, and the comfort of your hug. In the past, babies were held constantly and the absence of a parent meant danger from predators or abandonment. You cannot spoil a baby by holding them during infancy.\n\nIf the crying continues for longer than usual and you cannot calm the baby, contact a health care provider for advice.\n\nTry to get enough rest. Tired parents are less able to care for their baby.\n\nUse the resources of family, friends, or outside caregivers to allow yourself time to recover your energy. This will also be helpful for your baby. It does not mean that you are a bad parent or are abandoning your child. As long as caregivers are taking safety precautions and comforting the baby when necessary, you may be sure that your child is well cared for during your break.\n\nContact your provider immediately if your baby's crying occurs with symptoms such as fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, breathing difficulty, or other signs of illness.\n\n---\n\n**Crying in Infancy**\n\nInfants have a cry reflex that is a normal response to stimuli, such as pain or hunger.

In fact, research suggests that babies who don't cry as much may be at risk for future behavioral problems.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Colic: The Mystery Solved (Sort Of)**\n\nColic is characterized by episodes of intense crying lasting more than 3 hours a day. Despite its name, colic is not actually related to the digestive system. Instead, it's thought to be caused by overstimulation or sensitivity to external stimuli.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Baby Burping: A Game-Changer**\n\nBurping your baby can help relieve gas and discomfort, making them less prone to crying. Try holding your baby upright and gently patting their back while they're being fed. This can help prevent colic-like symptoms.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Topics**\n\n*   Infant and Newborn Care",

In the body, these antibodies can form immune complexes that cause inflammation and block blood vessels, leading to cryoglobulinemic vasculitis.\n\nCryoglobulinemia is part of a group of diseases that cause damage and inflammation of the blood vessels throughout the body (vasculitis). There are three main types:\n\n*   **Type I**: Most often related to cancer of the blood or immune systems.\n*   **Type II** and **Type III**: Also referred to as mixed cryoglobulinemia, these types are most often found in people with chronic inflammatory conditions, such as autoimmune diseases or hepatitis C.\n\nOther conditions that may be related to cryoglobulinemia include:\n\n*   Leukemia\n*   Multiple myeloma\n*   Primary macroglobulinemia\n*   Rheumatoid arthritis\n*   Systemic lupus erythematosus\n\n_Symptoms_\n\nSymptoms will vary depending on the type of disorder and the organs involved. They may include:\n\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Fatigue\n*   Glomerulonephritis (kidney inflammation)\n*   Joint pain\n*   Muscle pain\n*   Purpura\n*   Raynaud phenomenon\n*   Skin death\n*   Skin ulcers\n\n_Exams and Tests_\n\nThe health care provider will do a physical exam, checking for signs of liver and spleen swelling. Tests for cryoglobulinemia include:\n\n*   Complete blood count (CBC)\n*   Complement assay -- complement levels will be low.\n*   Cryoglobulin test -- may show presence of cryoglobulins\n*   Liver function tests -- may be high if hepatitis C is present\n*   Rheumatoid factor -- positive in types II and III\n*   Skin biopsy -- may show inflammation in blood vessels, vasculitis\n*   Protein electrophoresis - blood -- may show an abnormal antibody protein\n*   Urinalysis -- may show blood in the urine if the kidneys are affected\n\n_Treatment_\n\nTreatment depends on the type of cryoglobulinemia and its severity. For mild or moderate forms, taking steps to deal with the underlying cause can be effective.\n\nFor severe cryoglobulinemia vasculitis involving vital organs or large areas of skin, corticosteroids and other medicines that suppress the immune system are used.\n\nRituximab is an effective drug with fewer risks than other medicines. Cyclophosphamide is used in life-threatening conditions where rituximab is not working or available.\n\nPlasmapheresis is also used to remove abnormal cryoglobulin antibody proteins from the blood plasma.\n\n_Type I Cryoglobulinemia_\n\nTreatment for Type I cryoglobulinemia involves directing efforts against the abnormal cancer cells that produce the cryoglobulin.\n\n---\n\n**Cryoglobulinemia**\n\n_Causes_\n\nCryoglobulins are antibodies. It is not yet known why they become solid or gel-like at low temperatures in the laboratory. In the body, these antibodies can form immune complexes that can cause inflammation and block blood vessels. This is called cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. This may lead to problems ranging from skin rashes to kidney failure.\n\n_Cryoglobulinemia is part of a group of diseases that cause damage and inflammation of the blood vessels throughout the body (vasculitis). There are three main types of this condition._\n\n*   _Type I_: Most often related to cancer of the blood or immune systems.\n*   _Types II and III_: Also referred to as mixed cryoglobulinemia. Types II and III are most often found in people who have a long-lasting (chronic) inflammatory condition, such as an autoimmune disease or hepatitis C. Most people with the type II form of cryoglobulinemia have a chronic hepatitis C infection.\n*   _Other conditions that may be related to cryoglobulinemia_: Leukemia, multiple myeloma, primary macroglobulinemia, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n_Symptoms_\n\nSymptoms will vary, depending on the type of disorder you have and the organs that are involved.

You will be checked for signs of liver and spleen swelling.\n\nTests for cryoglobulinemia include:\n\n*   _Complete blood count (CBC)_.\n*   _Complement assay_ -- complement levels will be low.\n*   _Cryoglobulin test_ -- may show presence of cryoglobulins. (This is a complicated laboratory procedure that involves many steps. It is important that the lab that performs the test is familiar with the process.)\n*   _Liver function tests_ -- may be high if hepatitis C is present.\n*   _Rheumatoid factor_ -- positive in types II and III.\n*   _Skin biopsy_ -- may show inflammation in blood vessels, vasculitis.\n*   _Protein electrophoresis - blood_ -- may show an abnormal antibody protein.\n*   _Urinalysis_ -- may show blood in the urine if the kidneys are affected.\n\n_Other tests may include:_\n\n*   _Angiogram_\n*   _Chest x-ray_\n*   _ESR_\n*   _Hepatitis C test_\n*   _Nerve conduction tests, if the person has numbness or weakness in the arms or legs_\n\n---\n\n**Cryoglobulinemia**\n\n**What is Cryoglobulinemia?**\n\nCryoglobulinemia is a disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal proteins called cryoglobulins in the blood. These proteins can cause inflammation and damage to various organs, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and liver.\n\n**Types of Cryoglobulinemia**\n\nThere are three types of cryoglobulinemia:\n\n*   **Type I**: This type is caused by a cancer of the blood or immune system, such as multiple myeloma.\n*   **Type II**: This type is associated with autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis.\n*   **Type III**: This type is often linked to infections, such as hepatitis C.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of cryoglobulinemia vary depending on the type and severity of the disorder. They may include:\n\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Fatigue\n*   Glomerulonephritis (kidney inflammation)\n*   Joint pain\n*   Muscle pain\n*   Purpura\n*   Raynaud phenomenon\n*   Skin death\n*   Skin ulcers\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe health care provider will do a physical exam to check for signs of liver and spleen swelling. The following tests may be performed:\n\n*   Complete blood count (CBC)\n*   Complement assay\n*   Cryoglobulin test\n*   Liver function tests\n*   Rheumatoid factor\n*   Skin biopsy\n*   Protein electrophoresis - blood\n*   Urinalysis\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment of cryoglobulinemia depends on the type and severity of the disorder. For mild or moderate forms, treatment may involve:\n\n*   Direct-acting medicines for hepatitis C to eliminate the virus\n*   Corticosteroids and other medicines that suppress the immune system\n*   Rituximab, an effective drug with fewer risks than other medicines\n*   Cyclophosphamide, used in life-threatening conditions where rituximab is not working or available\n*   Plasmapheresis, a procedure to remove abnormal cryoglobulin antibody proteins from the blood\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost of the time, mixed cryoglobulinemia does not lead to death. However, outlook can be poor if the kidneys are affected.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n*   Bleeding in the digestive tract (rare)\n*   Heart disease (rare)\n*   Skin infections or ulcers\n*   Kidney failure\n*   Liver failure\n*   Skin death\n*   Death\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of cryoglobulinemia, have hepatitis C and develop symptoms of cryoglobulinemia, or have cryoglobulinemia and develop new or worsening symptoms.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no known prevention for the condition. Staying away from cold temperatures may prevent some symptoms, and testing and treatment for hepatitis C infection will reduce your risk.\n\n---\n\n**Cryoglobulinemia**\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no known prevention for the condition.\n\nStaying away from cold temperatures may prevent some symptoms.\n\nTesting and treatment for hepatitis C infection will reduce your risk.\n\n**References**\n\nDiGuardo MA, Bobr A, Winters JL.

Symptoms may include inflammation in blood vessels (vasculitis), kidney inflammation, nerve damage, joint pain, lung problems, and skin lesions.\n\n_*How the Test is Performed:_*\n\nThe test for cryoglobulins requires a special blood specimen collection method due to their temperature sensitivity. The blood should be drawn from a vein on the inside of the elbow or back of the hand, not from a catheter with heparin. The site is cleaned with antiseptic, and an elastic band is applied to the upper arm to make the vein swell with blood. A needle is inserted into the vein, and the blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle.\n\n_*How to Prepare for the Test:_*\n\nIt's recommended to call ahead and ask to have your blood drawn by a lab technician who has experience collecting blood for this test.\n\n_*How the Test will Feel:_*\n\nSome people may feel discomfort when the needle is inserted, followed by throbbing afterward.\n\n_*Why the Test is Performed:_*\n\nThis test is typically done when a person has symptoms of a condition associated with cryoglobulins, such as cryoglobulinemia, hepatitis C, infectious mononucleosis, leukemia, lymphoma, macroglobulinemia, multiple myeloma, rheumatoid arthritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n_*Normal Results:_*\n\nNormally, there are no cryoglobulins. Note that normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories.\n\n_*What Abnormal Results Mean:_*\n\nA positive test may indicate the presence of cryoglobulinemia, hepatitis (especially hepatitis C), infectious mononucleosis, leukemia, lymphoma, macroglobulinemia, multiple myeloma, rheumatoid arthritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus. Additional conditions under which the test may be performed include nephrotic syndrome.\n\n_*Risks:_*\n\nRisks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include excessive bleeding, fainting or feeling lightheaded, hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin), and infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken).\n\n---\n\n**Cryoglobulins**\n\n_Cryoglobulins are antibodies that become solid or gel-like at low temperatures in the laboratory._\n\nThis article describes the blood test used to check for them.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nBecause they are temperature sensitive, cryoglobulins are hard to accurately measure. The blood specimen must be collected in a special way. The test should only be done in laboratories that are equipped for it.\n\nBlood is drawn from a vein. A vein on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand is used in most cases. Blood should NOT be drawn from a catheter that has heparin in it. The site is cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic). The health care provider wraps an elastic band around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area and make the vein swell with blood.\n\nNext, the provider gently inserts a needle into the vein. The blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm. The vial should be warm at room or body temperature, before it is used. Vials that are colder than room temperature before being processed at the laboratory may not give accurate results.\n\nOnce the blood has been collected, the needle is removed, and the puncture site is covered to stop any bleeding.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou may want to call ahead to ask to have your blood drawn by a lab technician who has experience collecting blood for this test.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nSome people feel discomfort when the needle is inserted. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis test is most often done when a person has symptoms of a condition associated with cryoglobulins. Cryoglobulins are associated with cryoglobulinemia. They also occur in other conditions that affect the skin, joints, kidneys, and nervous system.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormally, there are no cryoglobulins.\n\nNote: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\n---\n\n**Cryoglobulins**\n\n**What is a cryoglobin?**\n\nA cryoglobin is a type of abnormal protein found in the blood. It's called a \"cryo\" because it forms crystals when cooled to a certain temperature.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNormally, there are no cryoglobulins in the blood.\n\n**Abnormal Results**\n\nA positive test may indicate:\n\n* Cryoglobulinemia\n* Hepatitis (especially hepatitis C)\n* Infectious mononucleosis\n* Leukemia\n* Lymphoma\n* Macroglobulinemia -- primary\n* Multiple myeloma\n* Rheumatoid arthritis\n* Systemic lupus erythematosus\n\n**Risks**\n\nThe risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**References**\n\nDe Vita S, Gandolfo S, Quartuccio L.

    "content": "**Cryopyrin-associated Periodic Syndromes**\n\n**What are Cryopyrin-associated Periodic Syndromes?**\n\nCryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) are a group of conditions that have overlapping signs and symptoms and the same genetic cause. The group includes three conditions known as familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome type 1 (FCAS1), Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), and neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disorder (NOMID). These conditions were once thought to be distinct disorders but are now considered to be part of the same condition spectrum. FCAS1 is the least severe form of CAPS, MWS is intermediate in severity, and NOMID is the most severe form.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of CAPS affect multiple body systems. Generally, CAPS are characterized by periodic episodes of skin rash, fever, and joint pain. These episodes can be triggered by exposure to cold temperatures, fatigue, other stressors, or they may arise spontaneously. Episodes can last from a few hours to several days. These episodes typically begin in infancy or early childhood and persist throughout life.\n\n**Distinct Patterns of Features**\n\nWhile the CAPS spectrum shares similar signs and symptoms, the individual conditions tend to have distinct patterns of features. People with FCAS1 are particularly sensitive to the cold, and exposure to cold temperatures can trigger a painful or burning rash. The rash usually affects the torso and limbs but may spread to the rest of the body. In addition to fever and joint pain, other possible symptoms include muscle aches, chills, drowsiness, eye redness, headache, and nausea.\n\n**Individual Conditions**\n\n* **FCAS1**: People with FCAS1 are particularly sensitive to the cold, and exposure to cold temperatures can trigger a painful or burning rash. The rash usually affects the torso and limbs but may spread to the rest of the body.\n* **MWS**: Individuals with MWS develop the typical periodic episodes of skin rash, fever, and joint pain after cold exposure, although episodes may occur spontaneously or all the time. Additionally, they can develop progressive hearing loss in their teenage years.\n* **NOMID**: In people with NOMID, the signs and symptoms of the condition are usually present from birth and persists throughout life. In addition to skin rash and fever, affected individuals may have joint inflammation, swelling, and joint deformities called contractures that may restrict movement.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThe exact frequency of CAPS is unknown, but it is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 200,000 people worldwide.\n\n**Causes**\n\nCAPS are caused by mutations in the NLRP3 gene, which codes for a protein called cryopyrin. This protein plays a crucial role in the innate immune system and helps to regulate inflammation.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nCAPS are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition. Each child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome type 1 (FCAS1)\n* Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS)\n* Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disorder (NOMID)\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on CAPS, please visit the following resources:\n\n* National Institutes of Health (NIH) - Rare Diseases\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - Rare Genetic Disorders\n\n**References**\n\nPlease note that references are not provided in this cleaned output.\n\n---\n\n**Cryopyrin-associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS)**\n\n**What are Cryopyrin-associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS)?**\n\nCryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) are a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by recurring episodes of inflammation, fever, and skin rash. The conditions were once thought to be distinct disorders but are now considered part of the same condition spectrum.\n\n**Types of CAPS**\n\nThere are three main types of CAPS:\n\n1. **Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome Type 1 (FCAS1)**: This is the least severe form of CAPS.\n2. **Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS)**: This is an intermediate form of CAPS, characterized by progressive hearing loss in teenage years.\n3. **Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disorder (NOMID)**: This is the most severe form of CAPS, with symptoms present from birth and persisting throughout life.\n\n**Symptoms of CAPS**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of CAPS affect multiple body systems and include:\n\n* Periodic episodes of skin rash, fever, and joint pain\n* Episodes can be triggered by exposure to cold temperatures, fatigue, other stressors, or they may arise spontaneously\n* Muscle aches, chills, drowsiness, eye redness, headache, and nausea\n\n**Causes of CAPS**\n\nCAPS are caused by variants (also known as mutations) in the NLRP3 gene. The NLRP3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cryopyrin, which is involved in the assembly of an inflammasome that helps trigger the inflammatory process.\n\n**Prevalence of CAPS**\n\nCAPS are rare, with an estimated prevalence of 2 to 5 per million individuals, collectively. However, it is thought that the conditions are underdiagnosed since the features of CAPS are similar to other more common conditions.\n\n---\n\n**Cryopyrin-associated Periodic Syndromes**\n\n**What is Cryopyrin-associated Periodic Syndrome?**\n\nCryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) is a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by inappropriate inflammatory responses. This leads to episodes of fever and damage to the body's cells and tissues.\n\n**The NLRP3 Gene**\n\nCAPS are caused by variants in the NLRP3 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called cryopyrin. Cryopyrin is involved in the assembly of an inflammasome, a molecular complex that helps trigger the inflammatory process.\n\nResearchers believe that NLRP3 gene variants that cause CAPS result in an overactive cryopyrin protein, leading to inappropriate inflammatory responses and impairment of the body's mechanisms for controlling inflammation.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nCAPS are usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. People with the condition are born with one altered copy of the NLRP3 gene in each cell. In most cases, the altered gene is inherited from an affected parent.\n\nRarely, the genetic change that causes CAPS is not inherited but occurs at some point during embryonic development or later in life, resulting in mosaicism.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nCAPS Cryopyrinopathy NLRP3-associated autoinflammatory disease\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Chronic infantile neurological, cutaneous and articular syndrome\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Familial amyloid nephropathy with urticaria AND deafness\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome 1\n*   Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center)\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n    *   FAMILIAL COLD AUTOINFLAMMATORY SYNDROME 1; FCAS1\n    *   MUCKLE-WELLS SYNDROME; MWS\n    *   CINCA SYNDROME; CINCA\n\n---\n\n**Cryopyrin-associated Periodic Syndromes**\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   **FAMILIAL COLD AUTOINFLAMMATORY SYNDROME 1; FCAS1**\n*   **MUCKLE-WELLS SYNDROME; MWS**\n*   **CINCA SYNDROME; CINCA**\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   **PubMed**\n*   Genetic Testing Information\n    *   **Genetic Testing Registry: Chronic infantile neurological, cutaneous and articular syndrome**\n    *   **Genetic Testing Registry: Familial amyloid nephropathy with urticaria AND deafness**\n    *   **Genetic Testing Registry: Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome 1**\n\n**Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**\n\n*   **Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome**\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n*   **National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)**\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   **ClinicalTrials.gov**\n\n**References**\n\n*   Assrawi E, Louvrier C, Lepelletier C, Georgin-Lavialle S, Bouaziz JD, Awad F, Moinet F, Moguelet P, Vignon-Pennamen MD, Piterboth W, Jumeau C, Cobret L, El Khouri E, Copin B, Duquesnoy P, Legendre M, Grateau G, Karabina SA, Amselem S, Giurgea I.

It is caused by parasites called Cryptosporidium, or Crypto . These parasites live in soil, food, and water.\n\n**How do people get infected with crypto?**\n\nYou can become infected with Crypto by swallowing the parasite if it is in your food, drinking water, or water that you swim in. You can also get infected when you touch something that has been contaminated, and then you touch your eyes, mouth, or nose. Another way that Crypto can spread is through sexual contact.\n\n**Who is more likely to get crypto?**\n\nCertain people are more likely to get Crypto; they include:\n\n* People who touch infected animals, often cows or sheep\n* People with weakened immune systems\n\n**What are the symptoms of cryptosporidiosis?**\n\nThe most common symptom of cryptosporidiosis is watery diarrhea. Other symptoms include:\n\n* Dehydration\n* Weight loss\n* Stomach cramps or pain\n* Fever\n* Nausea and vomiting\n\nThe symptoms generally begin 2 to 10 days after becoming infected with the parasite. In people with healthy immune systems, the symptoms can last about 1 to 2 weeks. Occasionally, the symptoms can last longer or come and go for up to 30 days.\n\n**How is cryptosporidiosis diagnosed?**\n\nCryptosporidiosis is diagnosed by examining stool samples, usually under a microscope. People with Crypto can have many parasites in their stool one day but not as many the next day. So you may need to give the lab three stool samples collected on three different days. This helps make sure that your diagnosis is correct.\n\n**What are the treatments for cryptosporidiosis?**\n\nMost people with cryptosporidiosis get better without treatment. It usually takes about one to two weeks. It's important to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration if you are pregnant. Infants and young children should also get extra fluids. If you are pregnant or if you think that you or your child are severely dehydrated, contact your provider about how to get enough fluids. Some people who are dehydrated may need to get intravenous (IV) fluids in a hospital.\n\nOver-the-counter anti-diarrheal medicine might help slow down diarrhea, but do not take it without first asking your provider. There is a medicine to treat diarrhea caused by Crypto in people with healthy immune systems. You and your provider can talk about whether that medicine is right for you.\n\n**Can cryptosporidiosis be prevented?**\n\nTo lower your chance of getting or spreading Crypto:\n\n* Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after using the toilet, changing diapers, or touching animals.\n* Only drink water that you know is safe.\n* Only drink milk and apple cider that have been pasteurized.\n* Don't eat uncooked foods when traveling in countries where the food supply might be unsafe.\n* Never go swimming when you have diarrhea.\n* Don't swallow water when you go swimming.\n* Use condoms or dental dams every time you have sex. This will also help prevent other sexually transmitted infections.\n\n**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention**\n\nCryptosporidiosis is a contagious disease that causes watery diarrhea. It is caused by parasites called Cryptosporidium, or Crypto . These parasites live in soil, food, and water. They are found in every region of the United States and throughout the world. Crypto can also be found on surfaces or dirty hands that have been contaminated with the stool (poop) of humans or animals that have the infection.\n\nYou can become infected with Crypto by swallowing the parasite if it is in your food, drinking water, or water that you swim in. You can also get infected when you touch something that has been contaminated, and then you touch your eyes, mouth, or nose.

    "content": "**Cryptosporidium Enteritis**\n\n_Causes_\n\nCryptosporidium has recently been recognized as a cause of diarrhea worldwide in all age groups. It has a greater effect on people with a weakened immune system, including:\n\n*   People who take medicines to suppress their immune system\n*   People with HIV/AIDS\n*   Transplant recipients\n\nIn these groups, this infection is not just bothersome, but can lead to severe and life-threatening loss of muscle and body mass (wasting) and malnutrition.\n\nThe major risk factor is drinking water contaminated with stool (feces). People at higher risk include:\n\n*   Animal handlers\n*   People who are in close contact with infected people\n*   Young children\n\nOutbreaks have been linked to:\n\n*   Drinking from contaminated public water supplies\n*   Drinking unpasteurized cider\n*   Swimming in contaminated pools and lakes\n\nSome outbreaks have been very large.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms of infection include:\n\n*   Abdominal cramping\n*   Diarrhea, which is often watery, non-bloody, large-volume, and occurs many times a day\n*   General sick feeling (malaise)\n*   Malnutrition and weight loss (in severe and prolonged cases)\n*   Nausea\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThese tests may be done:\n\n*   Antibody test to see if cryptosporidium is in the stool\n*   Intestinal biopsy (rare)\n*   Stool exam with special techniques (AFB staining)\n*   Stool exam using a microscope to look for the parasites and their eggs\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere are several treatments for cryptosporidium enteritis.\n\nThe best approach is to improve immune function in people who have a weakened immune system. In people with HIV/AIDS, this can be done by using HIV-antiviral medicines. Using this type of treatment can lead to a complete remission of cryptosporidium enteritis.\n\nMedicines such as nitazoxanide have been used in children and adults. Other medicines that are sometimes used include:\n\n*   Nitazoxanide\n*   Paromomycin\n\nThese medicines often help only for a little while. It is common for the infection to return.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nIn healthy people, the infection will clear up, but it can last up to a month. In people with a weakened immune system, long-term diarrhea may cause weight loss and malnutrition.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nThese complications can occur:\n\n*   Inflammation of a bile duct\n*   Inflammation of the gallbladder\n*   Inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)\n*   Malabsorption (not enough nutrients being absorbed from the intestinal tract)\n*   Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)\n*   Loss of body mass that causes extreme thinness and weakness (wasting syndrome)\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your health care provider if you develop watery diarrhea that does not go away within a few days, especially if you have a weakened immune system.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nProper sanitation and hygiene, including handwashing, are important measures for preventing this illness.\n\nCertain water filters can also reduce risk by filtering out the cryptosporidium eggs. However, the pores of the filter must be smaller than 1 micron to be effective.

To make sure your test results are accurate, be sure to carefully follow all the instructions for providing your urine sample.\n\n**Risks of the Test**\n\nThere is no known risk to having a crystals in urine test.\n\n**Interpreting the Results**\n\nThe test results will usually show if you have any crystals in your urine, the amount, and what they are made of. It's best to ask your provider to explain what your results mean. That's because different types of crystals are linked to different medical conditions, and your provider may need to order other tests to make a diagnosis.\n\nSome common types of crystals that may form stones in some people include:\n\n* Calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate\n* Uric acid and urates\n* Struvite\n\nHaving crystals in your urine doesn't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Large amounts of some types of crystals may be caused by:\n\n* Certain medicines, such as calcium-based antacids, some types of antibiotics, diuretics (water pills), and antiviral medicines\n* Your diet, especially eating too much animal protein, such as fish, shellfish, and organ meats\n* Not drinking enough fluids\n\nIf you have questions about your test results and how you can prevent crystals in urine, talk with your provider.\n\n**References**\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.

    "content": "**Culdocentesis**\n\n_Culdocentesis is a procedure that checks for abnormal fluid in the space just behind the vagina. This area is called the cul-de-sac._\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nFirst, you will have a pelvic exam. Then, the health care provider will hold the cervix with an instrument and lift it slightly.\n\nA long, thin needle is inserted through the wall of the vagina (just below the uterus). A sample is taken of any fluid found in the space. The needle is pulled out.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nYou may be asked to walk or sit for a short time before the test is done.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nYou may have an uncomfortable, cramping feeling. You will feel a brief, sharp pain as the needle is inserted.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nThis procedure is rarely done today because a transvaginal ultrasound can show fluid behind the uterus.\n\nIt may be done when:\n\n* You have pain in the lower abdomen and pelvis, and other tests suggest there is fluid in the area.\n* You may have a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or ovarian cyst.\n* You have suffered blunt abdominal trauma.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNo fluid in the cul-de-sac, or a very small amount of clear fluid, is normal.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nFluid may still be present, even if not seen with this test. You may need other tests.\n\nA sample of fluid may be taken and tested for infection.\n\nIf blood is found in the fluid sample, you may need emergency surgery.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks include puncturing the uterine or bowel wall.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nYou may need someone to take you home if you were given medicines to relax.\n\n---\n\n**Culdocentesis**\n\n**What is Culdocentesis?**\n\nCuldocentesis is a medical procedure used to diagnose conditions affecting the female reproductive system. It involves inserting a needle into the cul-de-sac, a small pocket of fluid near the cervix, to collect a sample of fluid for testing.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nNo fluid in the cul-de-sac, or a very small amount of clear fluid, is normal.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nFluid may still be present, even if not seen with this test. You may need other tests.\n\nA sample of fluid may be taken and tested for infection.\n\nIf blood is found in the fluid sample, you may need emergency surgery.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks include puncturing the uterine or bowel wall.\n\n**Considerations**\n\nYou may need someone to take you home if you were given medicines to relax.\n\n**References**\n\nBraen GR, Kiel J.
