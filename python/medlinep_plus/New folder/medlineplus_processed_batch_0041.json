    "content": "**Chromosome 17**\n\nHumans normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell, divided into 23 pairs. Two copies of chromosome 17, one copy inherited from each parent, form one of the pairs. Chromosome 17 spans about 83 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) and represents between 2.5 and 3 percent of the total DNA in cells.\n\n**Identifying the Genes on Each Chromosome**\n\nIdentifying the genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 17 likely contains 1,100 to 1,200 genes that provide instructions for making proteins. These proteins perform a variety of different roles in the body.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Chromosomal Changes**\n\nThe following chromosomal conditions are associated with changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 17.\n\n*   **17q12 Deletion Syndrome**\n    *   17q12 deletion syndrome is a condition that results from the deletion of a small piece of chromosome 17 in each cell. Signs and symptoms can include abnormalities of the kidneys and urinary system, a form of diabetes called maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 (MODY5), developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and behavioral or psychiatric disorders.\n    *   Most people with 17q12 deletion syndrome are missing about 1.4 million base pairs on the long (q) arm of the chromosome at a position designated q12.\n    *   The segment that is most often deleted includes 15 genes. Some features likely result from the loss of two of these genes, HNF1B and LHX1.\n*   **17q12 Duplication**\n    *   17q12 duplication is a chromosomal change in which a small piece of chromosome 17 is abnormally duplicated in each cell. The signs and symptoms vary significantly, even among members of the same family.\n    *   Some individuals with the duplication have no apparent signs or symptoms or have features that are very mild. Other individuals can have intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, and a wide range of physical abnormalities.\n    *   Most people with 17q12 duplications have an extra copy of about 1.4 Mb of DNA at position q12 on chromosome 17.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 17**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia**: A type of blood cancer caused by a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 15 and 17. The t(15;17) translocation fuses part of the PML gene from chromosome 15 with part of the RARA gene from chromosome 17, producing the PML-RARα protein.\n* **Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease**: Duplication of a small piece of chromosome 17 at position p12 causes most cases of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A. The duplication leads to an overproduction of the PMP22 protein, which may overwhelm the cells' ability to process it correctly, impairing myelin development and function.\n* **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans**: Translocation of genetic material between chromosomes 17 and 22 causes most cases of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. The translocation fuses part of the COL1A1 gene from chromosome 17 with part of the PDGFB gene from chromosome 22, leading to the production of a larger amount of active PDGFB protein.\n* **Koolen-de Vries Syndrome**: Deletion of a small amount of genetic material on chromosome 17 can cause Koolen-de Vries syndrome. The deletion affects one of the two copies of chromosome 17 in each cell and contains at least six genes, including KANSL1. The loss of this gene is thought to account for the features of the disorder.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **More About This Health Condition**: Learn more about these conditions and their effects on the body.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 17**\n\n**Miller-Dieker Syndrome**\n\nMiller-Dieker syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material near the end of the short (p) arm of chromosome 17. The signs and symptoms of Miller-Dieker syndrome are related to the loss of multiple genes, particularly the PAFAH1B1 and the YWHAE genes.\n\n*   Lissencephaly: a condition characterized by an abnormally smooth brain that does not have the normal folds and grooves.\n*   Severe intellectual disabilities\n*   Developmental delays\n*   Seizures\n*   Weak muscle tone (hypotonia)\n*   Feeding difficulties\n\n**Potocki-Lupski Syndrome**\n\nPotocki-Lupski syndrome results from a duplication of a small piece of chromosome 17 in each cell, specifically a region of the p arm designated p11.2.\n\n*   Developmental delays\n*   Mild to moderate intellectual disabilities\n*   Autism spectrum disorder (which affects social interaction and communication)\n*   Sleep disturbances\n*   Other health problems\n\n**Smith-Magenis Syndrome**\n\nSmith-Magenis syndrome usually results from a deletion of a small piece of chromosome 17 in each cell, specifically a region of the p arm designated p11.2.\n\n*   Mild to moderate intellectual disabilities\n*   Delayed speech and language skills\n*   Distinctive facial features\n*   Sleep disturbances\n*   Behavioral problems\n\n**Yuan-Harel-Lupski Syndrome**\n\nDuplication of a small piece of chromosome 17 in a region designated p12-11.2 can cause Yuan-Harel-Lupski (YUHAL) syndrome, which is characterized by neurological problems similar to those seen in people with Potocki-Lupski syndrome and CMT1A.\n\n*   Developmental delays\n*   Behavioral problems\n*   Muscle weakness\n*   Decreased sensitivity to touch, heat, and cold in the lower legs and feet\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\n*   A deletion of material near the end of the p arm of chromosome 17 has been associated with intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, seizures, and distinctive facial features.\n*   17p13.3 duplication syndrome, also called split-hand/foot malformation with long bone deficiency or SHFLD3, is a chromosomal change in which a small piece of chromosome 17 is abnormally copied in each cell.\n*   The signs and symptoms of SHFLD3 can vary from person to person but typically include abnormalities of a bone in the lower leg (tibia) combined with various malformations of the hands and feet.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 17**\n\nd a circular structure called a ring chromosome 17. Ring chromosomes occur when a chromosome breaks in two places and the ends of the chromosome arms fuse together to form a circular structure.\n\n**Other cancers**\n\nSomatic genetic changes in chromosome 17 have been identified in several additional types of cancer. A particular chromosomal abnormality called an isochromosome 17q occurs frequently in some cancers. This abnormal version of chromosome 17 has two q arms instead of one q arm and one p arm. As a result, the chromosome has an extra copy of some genes and is missing copies of other genes.\n\nAn isochromosome 17q has been found in different cancers of blood-forming tissues. It has also been identified in certain solid tumors, including a type of brain tumor called a medulloblastoma and tumors of the brain and spinal cord known as primitive neuroectodermal tumors. Although an isochromosome 17q probably plays a role in both the development and progression of these cancers, the specific genetic changes related to cancer growth are unknown.\n\n**Chromosomal conditions**\n\nThe following chromosomal conditions are associated with changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 17.\n\n*   **17q12 deletion syndrome**\n    *   17q12 deletion syndrome is a condition that results from the deletion of a small piece of chromosome 17 in each cell.\n    *   Signs and symptoms of 17q12 deletion syndrome can include abnormalities of the kidneys and urinary system, a form of diabetes called maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 (MODY5), developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and behavioral or psychiatric disorders.\n    *   Most people with 17q12 deletion syndrome are missing about 1.4 million base pairs on the long (q) arm of the chromosome at a position designated q12.\n    *   The segment that is most often deleted in people with 17q12 deletion syndrome includes 15 genes.\n*   **17q12 duplication**\n    *   17q12 duplication is a chromosomal change in which a small piece of chromosome 17 is abnormally duplicated in each cell.\n    *   The signs and symptoms that are caused by this duplication vary significantly, even among members of the same family.\n    *   Some individuals with the duplication have no apparent signs or symptoms or have features that are very mild. Other individuals can have intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, and a wide range of physical abnormalities.\n    *   Most people with 17q12 duplications have an extra copy of about 1.4 Mb of DNA at position q12 on chromosome 17.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 17**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **17q12 Duplication**\n\t+ A chromosomal change where a small piece of chromosome 17 is abnormally duplicated in each cell.\n\t+ Signs and symptoms vary significantly, even among family members.\n\t+ Some individuals have no apparent signs or symptoms, while others may experience intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, and physical abnormalities.\n* **Most People with 17q12 Duplications Have an Extra Copy of About 1.4 Mb of DNA at Position q12 on Chromosome 17**\n\t+ The same region is deleted in people with 17q12 deletion syndrome.\n* **The Duplicated Segment of 17q12 Includes at Least 15 Genes**\n\t+ It's unclear which genes contribute to intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, and other features associated with the duplication.\n\t+ Researchers suspect additional genetic factors may play a role.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia**\n\t+ A type of blood cancer caused by a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 15 and 17.\n\t+ The t(15;17) translocation fuses part of the PML gene from chromosome 15 with part of the RARA gene from chromosome 17.\n\t+ This genetic change is somatic, acquired during a person's lifetime, and present only in certain cells.\n* **The Protein Produced from this Fused Gene is Called PML-RARα**\n\t+ The PML-RARα protein functions differently than the proteins produced from the normal PML and RARA genes.\n\t+ The RARA gene on chromosome 17 provides instructions for making a transcription factor called the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα).\n\t+ Normally, the RARα protein controls the activity of genes important for the maturation of immature white blood cells (promyelocytes).\n\t+ The PML gene on chromosome 15 provides instructions for a protein that acts as a tumor suppressor.\n\t+ The PML-RARα protein interferes with the normal function of both the PML and RARα proteins, leading to abnormal cell proliferation.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 17**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease**\n\t+ Duplication of a small piece of chromosome 17 at position p12 that includes the PMP22 gene causes most cases of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A, or CMT1A.\n\t+ Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease damages the peripheral nerves, which connect the brain and spinal cord to the muscles and to the cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound.\n\t+ Peripheral nerve damage can result in a loss of sensation and wasting (atrophy) of muscles in the feet, legs, and hands.\n* **The Protein Produced from the PMP22 Gene**\n\t+ The protein produced from the PMP22 gene is a component of myelin, a protective substance that covers nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses.\n\t+ Before they become part of myelin, newly produced PMP22 proteins are processed and packaged within cells. Completion of these processing and packaging steps is critical for proper myelin development, maintenance, and function.\n* **The Duplication of Part of Chromosome 17**\n\t+ The duplication of part of chromosome 17 creates an extra copy of the PMP22 gene, which leads to an overproduction of the PMP22 protein.\n\t+ Research suggests that excess PMP22 protein may overwhelm the cells' ability to process the protein correctly, leading to a buildup of unprocessed, nonfunctional protein.\n\t+ This buildup may impair the formation of new myelin and lead to the instability and loss of existing myelin (demyelination).\n* **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans**\n\t+ Translocation of genetic material between chromosomes 17 and 22, written as t(17;22), causes most cases of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, a rare type of skin cancer.\n\t+ This translocation fuses part of the COL1A1 gene from chromosome 17 with part of the PDGFB gene from chromosome 22.\n\t+ The fused COL1A1-PDGFB gene provides instructions for making a fused protein that researchers believe functions like the active PDGFB protein.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 17**\n\nThe COL1A1 gene from chromosome 17 fuses with part of the PDGFB gene from chromosome 22. This translocation is found on one or more extra chromosomes that can be either linear or circular. Extra chromosomes that are circular are known as supernumerary ring chromosomes.\n\n**Koolen-de Vries Syndrome**\n\n* Deletion of a small amount of genetic material (a microdeletion) on chromosome 17 can cause Koolen-de Vries syndrome.\n* This disorder is characterized by developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, a cheerful and sociable disposition, and a variety of physical abnormalities.\n* Most people with Koolen-de Vries syndrome are missing a sequence of about 500,000 base pairs, also written as 500 kilobases (kb), at position q21.31 on chromosome 17.\n* The exact size of the deletion varies among affected individuals, but it contains at least six genes, including KANSL1.\n* This deletion affects one of the two copies of chromosome 17 in each cell.\n\n**Causes and Inheritance**\n\n* Because variants (also called mutations) in the KANSL1 gene cause the same signs and symptoms as the deletion, researchers have concluded that the loss of this gene accounts for the features of Koolen-de Vries syndrome.\n* The protein produced from the KANSL1 gene is involved in controlling the activity of other genes and plays an important role in the development and function of many parts of the body.\n* Although the loss of this gene impairs normal development and function, its relationship to the specific features of Koolen-de Vries syndrome is unclear.\n* Koolen-de Vries syndrome is usually not inherited. However, most individuals with the deletion have at least one parent with a common variant of the q21.31 region of chromosome 17 called the H2 lineage.\n\n**H2 Lineage**\n\n* This variant is found in 20 percent of people of European and Middle Eastern descent, although it is rare in other populations.\n* In the H2 lineage, a 900 kb segment of DNA, which includes the region deleted in most people with Koolen-de Vries syndrome, has undergone an inversion.\n* An inversion involves two breaks in a chromosome; the resulting piece of DNA is reversed and reinserted into the chromosome.\n* People with the H2 lineage have no health problems related to the inversion. However, genetic material can be lost or duplicated when the inversion is passed to the next generation.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 17**\n\nPeople with the H2 lineage have no health problems related to the inversion. However, genetic material can be lost or duplicated when the inversion is passed to the next generation. Researchers believe that a parental inversion is probably necessary for a child to have the 17q21.31 microdeletion that is most often associated with Koolen-de Vries syndrome, but other factors are also thought to play a role. So, while the inversion is very common, only an extremely small percentage of parents with the inversion have a child affected by Koolen-de Vries syndrome.\n\n**Miller-Dieker Syndrome**\n\n*   Miller-Dieiker syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material near the end of the short (p) arm of chromosome 17.\n*   The signs and symptoms of Miller-Dieker syndrome are related to the loss of multiple genes, particularly the PAFAH1B1 and the YWHAE genes.\n*   Lissencephaly is associated with severe intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, seizures, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and feeding difficulties.\n\n**Potocki-Lupski Syndrome**\n\n*   Potocki-Lupski syndrome results from a duplication of a small piece of chromosome 17 in each cell.\n*   The condition is characterized by developmental delays, mild to moderate intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorder, sleep disturbances, and other health problems.\n*   Having an extra copy of the RAI1 gene may be responsible for many of the characteristic features of Potocki-Lupski syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 17: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n**Potocki-Lupski Syndrome**\n\nPotocki-Lupski syndrome results from a duplication of a small piece of chromosome 17 in each cell, specifically a region of the p arm designated p11.2. This condition is characterized by developmental delays, mild to moderate intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorder (which affects social interaction and communication), sleep disturbances, and other health problems.\n\nIn about two-thirds of affected individuals, the duplicated segment is approximately 3.7 Mb in size. In the remaining one-third of cases, the duplication ranges from less than 1 Mb to almost 20 Mb. All of these duplications affect one of the two copies of chromosome 17 in each cell.\n\nAlthough the duplicated region contains multiple genes, researchers believe that having an extra copy of one particular gene, RAI1, may be responsible for many of the characteristic features of Potocki-Lupski syndrome. All of the duplications that are known to cause the condition contain this gene.\n\nThe RAI1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps regulate the activity (expression) of other genes. Although most of the genes regulated by the RAI1 protein have not been identified, this protein appears to control the expression of several genes involved in daily (circadian) rhythms, such as the sleep-wake cycle. The RAI1 protein also appears to play a role in the development of the brain and of the bones in the head and face.\n\nStudies suggest that the duplication increases the amount of RAI1 protein, which disrupts the expression of genes that influence circadian rhythms. These changes may account for the sleep disturbances that occur in people with Potocki-Lupski syndrome.\n\nToo much RAI1 protein may also disrupt brain development, which could account for the developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, behavioral problems, and other neurological features of this condition. The development of the bones in the head and face may also be affected, leading to subtle facial differences in people with Potocki-Lupski syndrome.\n\n**Smith-Magenis Syndrome**\n\nSmith-Magenis syndrome usually results from a deletion of a small piece of chromosome 17 in each cell, specifically a region of the p arm designated p11.2. The features of Smith-Magenis syndrome include mild to moderate intellectual disabilities, delayed speech and language skills, distinctive facial features, sleep disturbances, and behavioral problems.\n\nTypically, the chromosome segment deleted in people with Smith-Magenis syndrome is the same one that is duplicated in people with Potocki-Lupski syndrome. Occasionally the deletion is larger or smaller. All of the deletions affect one of the two copies of chromosome 17 in each cell.\n\nResearchers believe that a loss of function of the RAI1 gene accounts for many of the signs and symptoms of Smith-Magenis syndrome. All of the deletions known to cause this condition contain this gene. Studies suggest that the deletion leads to a reduced amount of RAI1 protein in cells, which disrupts the expression of genes involved in circadian rhythms. These changes may account for the sleep disturbances that occur in people with Smith-Magenis syndrome.\n\nIt is unclear how a loss of one copy of the RAI1 gene leads to the other physical, psychological, and behavioral problems that are associated with this condition. It is likely that the loss of other genes in the deleted region influences the signs and symptoms of Smith-Magenis syndrome.\n\n**Yuan-Harel-Lupski Syndrome**\n\nDuplication of a small piece of chromosome 17 in a region designated p12-11.2 can cause Yuan-Harel-Lupski (YUHAL) syndrome, which is characterized by neurological problems similar to those seen in people with Potocki-Lupski syndrome and CMT1A.\n\nIn people with YUHAL syndrome, the duplicated segment ranges in size from about 3 Mb to nearly 20 Mb and always contains the RAI1 and PMP22 genes; it may also include additional genes. Certain features of YUHAL syndrome, such as developmental delays and behavioral problems, are likely caused by an extra copy of the RAI1 gene. Other features, including muscle weakness and decreased sensitivity to touch, heat, and cold in the lower legs and feet, are likely due to the duplication of the PMP22 gene.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 17**\n\n*   **Yuan-Harel-Lupski (YUHAL) Syndrome**: Duplication of a small piece of chromosome 17 in a region designated p12-11.2 can cause YUHAL syndrome, which is characterized by neurological problems similar to those seen in people with Potocki-Lupski syndrome and CMT1A.\n*   **Other Chromosomal Conditions**:\n    *   **Miller-Dieker Syndrome**: A deletion of material near the end of the p arm of chromosome 17 has been associated with intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, seizures, and distinctive facial features.\n    *   **SHFLD3 (Split-Hand/Foot Malformation with Long Bone Deficiency)**: A chromosomal change in which a small piece of chromosome 17 is abnormally copied in each cell. The duplicated segment contains a gene called BHLHA9, which is important for limb development.\n*   **Other Changes in Chromosome 17**:\n    *   **Partial Trisomy 17**: An extra piece of chromosome 17 in each cell.\n    *   **Partial Monosomy 17**: A missing segment of the chromosome in each cell.\n    *   **Ring Chromosome 17**: A circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and the ends of the chromosome arms fuse together to form a circular structure.\n*   **Other Cancers**:\n    *   **Isochromosome 17q**: A chromosomal abnormality that has been identified in several additional types of cancer, including cancers of blood-forming tissues and certain solid tumors.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 17**\n\nChromosome 17 is a crucial part of the human genome, playing a significant role in various aspects of our biology. In this article, we'll delve into the world of chromosome 17, exploring its structure, function, and relationship with diseases.\n\n**Isochromosome 17q**\n\nAn isochromosome 17q is a chromosomal abnormality that occurs frequently in some cancers. This abnormal version of chromosome 17 has two q arms instead of one q arm and one p arm. As a result, the chromosome has an extra copy of some genes and is missing copies of other genes.\n\n**Cancer Connection**\n\nAn isochromosome 17q has been found in different cancers of blood-forming tissues. It has also been identified in certain solid tumors, including a type of brain tumor called a medulloblastoma and tumors of the brain and spinal cord known as primitive neuroectodermal tumors. Although an isochromosome 17q probably plays a role in both the development and progression of these cancers, the specific genetic changes related to cancer growth are unknown.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   National Human Genome Research Institute: Chromosome Abnormalities\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed\n\n**References**\n\nHere are some references related to chromosome 17:\n\n1.

    "content": "**Chromosome 18**\n\nHumans normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell, divided into 23 pairs. Two copies of chromosome 18, one copy inherited from each parent, form one of the pairs. Chromosome 18 spans about 78 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) and represents approximately 2.5 percent of the total DNA in cells.\n\n**Identifying Genes on Each Chromosome**\n\nIdentifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 18 likely contains 200 to 300 genes that provide instructions for making proteins. These proteins perform a variety of different roles in the body.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Chromosomal Changes**\n\nThe following chromosomal conditions are associated with changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 18:\n\n*   **Distal 18q Deletion Syndrome**\n    *   Distal 18q deletion syndrome occurs when a piece of the long (q) arm of chromosome 18 is missing. The term \"distal\" means that the missing piece (deletion) occurs near one end of the chromosome arm.\n    *   Signs and symptoms include delayed development and learning disabilities, short stature, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), foot abnormalities, and a wide variety of other features.\n*   **Proximal 18q Deletion Syndrome**\n    *   Like distal 18q deletion syndrome, proximal 18q deletion syndrome is a chromosomal condition that occurs when a piece of the q arm of chromosome 18 is missing. The term \"proximal\" means that in this disorder the deletion occurs near the center of the chromosome.\n    *   Signs and symptoms include delayed development and intellectual disability, recurrent seizures (epilepsy), behavioral problems, and characteristic facial features.\n*   **Tetrasomy 18p**\n    *   Tetrasomy 18p results from the presence of an abnormal extra chromosome, called an isochromosome 18p, in each cell. An isochromosome is a chromosome with two identical arms.\n    *   Cells normally have two copies of each chromosome, one inherited from each parent. In people with tetrasomy 18p, cells have the usual two copies of chromosome 18 plus an isochromosome 18p.\n    *   The extra genetic material from the isochromosome disrupts the normal course of development, causing intellectual disability, delayed development, and other characteristic features.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 18**\n\n**Trisomy 18**\n\nTrisomy 18 occurs when each cell in the body has three copies of chromosome 18 instead of the usual two copies, causing severe intellectual disability and multiple birth defects that are usually fatal by early childhood. In some cases, the extra copy of chromosome 18 is present in only some of the body's cells. This condition is known as mosaic trisomy 18.\n\nRarely, trisomy 18 is caused by an extra copy of only a piece of chromosome 18. This condition is known as partial trisomy 18. Partial trisomy 18 occurs when part of the q arm of chromosome 18 becomes attached (translocated) to another chromosome during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or very early in embryonic development.\n\nAffected individuals have two copies of chromosome 18, plus the extra material from chromosome 18 attached to another chromosome. If only part of the q arm is present in three copies, the physical signs of partial trisomy 18 may be less severe than those typically seen in trisomy 18. If the entire q arm is present in three copies, individuals may be as severely affected as if they had three full copies of chromosome 18.\n\nResearchers believe that extra copies of some genes on chromosome 18 disrupt the course of normal development, causing the characteristic features of trisomy 18 and the health problems associated with this disorder.\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\n*   **Partial Monosomy of Chromosome 18p (18p-)**: This condition occurs when a piece of the p arm of chromosome 18 is deleted. Individuals with this condition often have short stature, a round face, large ears, a shortened space between the nose and mouth (philtrum), droopy eyelids (ptosis), and mild to moderate intellectual disability.\n*   **Ring Chromosome 18**: This type of chromosome is formed when breaks occur at both ends of the chromosome and the broken ends join together to form a ring. Individuals with this chromosome abnormality often have intellectual disability, an unusually small head (microcephaly), widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), low-set ears, and speech problems.\n*   **Distal 18q Deletion Syndrome**: This condition occurs when a piece of the long (q) arm of chromosome 18 is missing. The signs and symptoms include delayed development and learning disabilities, short stature, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), foot abnormalities, and a wide variety of other features.\n*   **Proximal 18q Deletion Syndrome**: This condition occurs when a piece of the q arm of chromosome 18 is missing. The deletion occurs near the center of the chromosome, in an area between regions called 18q11.2 and 18q21.2. The size of the deletion varies among affected individuals. Proximal 18q deletion syndrome can lead to a wide variety of signs and symptoms among affected individuals, including delayed development and intellectual disability, recurrent seizures (epilepsy), behavioral problems, and characteristic facial features.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 18: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 3/5)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nThis Health Condition\nLike distal 18q deletion syndrome (described above), proximal 18q deletion syndrome is a chromosomal condition that occurs when a piece of the q arm of chromosome 18 is missing. The term \"proximal\" means that in this disorder the deletion occurs near the center of the chromosome, in an area between regions called 18q11.2 and 18q21.2. The size of the deletion varies among affected individuals. Proximal 18q deletion syndrome can lead to a wide variety of signs and symptoms among affected individuals, including delayed development and intellectual disability, recurrent seizures (epilepsy), behavioral problems, and characteristic facial features. These signs and symptoms are likely caused by the loss of specific genes in the deleted region.\n\n*Tetrasomy 18p*\n\nTetrasomy 18p results from the presence of an abnormal extra chromosome, called an isochromosome 18p, in each cell. An isochromosome is a chromosome with two identical arms. Normal chromosomes have one long (q) arm and one short (p) arm, but isochromosomes have either two q arms or two p arms. Isochromosome 18p is a version of chromosome 18 made up of two p arms.\n\nCells normally have two copies of each chromosome, one inherited from each parent. In people with tetrasomy 18p, cells have the usual two copies of chromosome 18 plus an isochromosome 18p. As a result, each cell has four copies of the short arm of chromosome 18. (The word \"tetrasomy\" is derived from \"tetra,\" the Greek word for \"four.\") The extra genetic material from the isochromosome disrupts the normal course of development, causing intellectual disability, delayed development, and the other characteristic features of this disorder.\n\n*Tetrasomy 18p*\n\nTetrasomy 18p results from the presence of an abnormal extra chromosome, called an isochromosome 18p, in each cell. An isochromosome is a chromosome with two identical arms. Normal chromosomes have one long (q) arm and one short (p) arm, but isochromosomes have either two q arms or two p arms.

(The word \"trisomy\" comes from \"tri,\" the Greek word for \"three.\") In some cases, the extra copy of chromosome 18 is present in only some of the body's cells. This condition is known as mosaic trisomy 18.\n\nRarely, trisomy 18 is caused by an extra copy of only a piece of chromosome 18. This condition is known as partial trisomy 18.

Chromosome 19 spans about 59 million base pairs (the building blocks of DNA) and represents almost 2 percent of the total DNA in cells.\n\n**Identifying Genes on Each Chromosome**\n\nIdentifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies.

These chromosome abnormalities are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in the cells that give rise to cancer. Rearrangements of genetic material between chromosome 19 and one of several other chromosomes have been found in some forms of blood cancer (leukemia). These rearrangements, called translocations, appear to be particularly common in a type of leukemia called acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). These translocations likely disrupt genes that are critical for keeping cell growth and division under control. Unregulated cell division can lead to the development of cancer.\n\n**Chromosomal Conditions**\nThe following chromosomal conditions are associated with changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 19.\n\n* **19p13.13 Deletion Syndrome**\n\t+ Results from the deletion of a small piece of the short (p) arm of chromosome 19 in each cell.\n\t+ Major features include an unusually large head size (macrocephaly), tall stature, delayed development of speech and motor skills, and intellectual disability that is usually moderate in severity. Seizures, feeding and digestive difficulties, and eye abnormalities are also common.\n\t+ People with this condition are missing anywhere from about 300,000 DNA building blocks (300 kilobases or 300 Kb) to more than 3 million DNA building blocks (3 megabases or 3 Mb) on the short arm of chromosome 19.\n\t+ The region of the deletion is usually referred to as p13.13, although some publications refer to it as p13.2. The region is the same; only the numbering differs.\n\t+ The exact size of the deletion varies among affected individuals, but it is thought to include at least 16 genes. This deletion affects one of the two copies of chromosome 19 in each cell.\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\nOther changes in the number or structure of chromosome 19 can have a variety of effects on growth and development. These chromosomal changes can cause delayed development, intellectual disability, feeding difficulties, hearing and vision impairment, heart problems, or other birth defects. The signs and symptoms that occur in a particular individual depend on the specific chromosomal change and which genes are involved.\n\nAmong the changes in chromosome 19 that have been reported are microdeletions, which remove a relatively small number of genes. These include 19p13.13 deletions (described above) and small deletions in other regions of the chromosome. Other possible changes include the presence of an extra piece of the chromosome in each cell (partial trisomy 19) or the absence of a larger segment of the chromosome in each cell (partial monosomy 19). Translocations of genetic material between chromosome 19 and another chromosome can also lead to extra or missing material from chromosome 19. Rarely, chromosome 19 forms a structure called a ring chromosome.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 19**\n\nChanges in the number or structure of chromosome 19 can have a variety of effects on growth and development.\n\n*   **Delayed Development, Intellectual Disability, Feeding Difficulties, Hearing and Vision Impairment, Heart Problems, or Other Birth Defects**: These chromosomal changes can cause delayed development, intellectual disability, feeding difficulties, hearing and vision impairment, heart problems, or other birth defects.\n*   **Microdeletions**: Microdeletions, which remove a relatively small number of genes, have been identified in chromosome 19.

These rearrangements, called translocations, appear to be particularly common in a type of leukemia called acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).\n*   **Disrupted Genes**: These translocations likely disrupt genes that are critical for keeping cell growth and division under control. Unregulated cell division can lead to the development of cancer.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Bonaglia MC, Marelli S, Novara F, Commodaro S, Borgatti R, Minardo G, Memo L, Mangold E, Beri S, Zucca C, Brambilla D, Molteni M, Giorda R, Weber RG, Zuffardi O.

    "content": "**Chromosome 1**\n\nHumans normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell, divided into 23 pairs. Two copies of chromosome 1, one copy inherited from each parent, form one of the pairs. Chromosome 1 is the largest human chromosome, spanning about 249 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) and representing approximately 8 percent of the total DNA in cells.\n\n**Identifying the Genes on Each Chromosome**\n\nIdentifying the genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 1 likely contains 2,000 to 2,100 genes that provide instructions for making proteins. These proteins perform a variety of different roles in the body.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Chromosomal Changes**\n\nThe following chromosomal conditions are associated with changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 1:\n\n*   **1p36 Deletion Syndrome**\n    *   Caused by a deletion of genetic material from a specific region in the short (p) arm of chromosome 1.\n    *   Signs and symptoms include intellectual disabilities, distinctive facial features, and structural abnormalities in several body systems.\n    *   In about 50 percent of people with this condition, the deleted region includes the tip of the p arm of chromosome 1. The size of the deletion varies among affected individuals.\n*   **1q21.1 Microdeletion**\n    *   A chromosomal change in which a small piece of the long (q) arm of chromosome 1 is deleted in each cell.\n    *   Most commonly, affected individuals are missing about 1.35 million base pairs in the q21.1 region.\n    *   The loss of multiple genes from this region probably contributes to the various signs and symptoms associated with a 1q21.1 microdeletion.\n*   **1q21.1 Microduplication**\n    *   A copied (duplicated) segment of genetic material at position q21.1 on one of the two copies of chromosome 1 in each cell.\n    *   Some people with a 1q21.1 microduplication have developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, or features of autism spectrum disorder.\n*   **Neuroblastoma**\n    *   Deletions in the 1p36 region of chromosome 1 have also been associated with neuroblastoma, a type of cancerous tumor composed of immature nerve cells (neuroblasts).\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 1: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/8)**\n\n**Thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome**\n\nA deletion in the 1q21.1 region of chromosome 1 is involved in most cases of thrombocytopenia-absent radius (TAR) syndrome. TAR syndrome is characterized by the absence of a bone called the radius in each forearm and a shortage (deficiency) of blood cells that are involved in clotting (platelets).\n\nThe deletion in chromosome 1 that is associated with TAR syndrome eliminates at least 200,000 DNA base pairs (200 kilobases, or 200 kb) from the q arm of the chromosome, including a gene called RBM8A. Most people with TAR syndrome have the deletion in one copy of chromosome 1, which removes one copy of the RBM8A gene, and a variant in the other copy of the RBM8A gene in each cell.\n\nThe RBM8A gene provides instructions for making a protein called RNA-binding motif protein 8A. This protein is believed to be involved in a number of important cellular functions that produce other proteins. The RBM8A gene variants that cause TAR syndrome reduce the amount of RNA-binding motif protein 8A in cells.\n\nThe deletion on chromosome 1 eliminates one copy of the RBM8A gene in each cell and the RNA-binding motif protein 8A that would have been produced from it. The reduced amount of RNA-binding motif protein 8A is thought to cause problems in the development of certain tissues, but it is unknown how it causes the specific signs and symptoms of TAR syndrome.\n\n**Other chromosomal conditions**\n\nOther changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 1 can have a variety of effects, including delayed growth and development, distinctive facial features, birth defects, and other health problems. Changes to chromosome 1 may include an extra segment of the p or q arm of the chromosome in each cell (partial trisomy 1p or 1q), a missing segment of the short or long arm of the chromosome in each cell (partial monosomy 1p or 1q), or a circular structure called ring chromosome 1.\n\n**Other cancers**\n\nSomatic changes in the structure of chromosome 1 are associated with other forms of cancer and conditions related to cancer. Deletions in the p arm of the chromosome have been identified in tumors of the brain and kidney. Duplications in the q arm of the chromosome have been reported in people with a disorder called myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disease of the blood and bone marrow.\n\n**1p36 deletion syndrome**\n\n1p36 deletion syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material from a specific region in the short (p) arm of chromosome 1. The signs and symptoms of this disorder include intellectual disabilities, distinctive facial features, and structural abnormalities in several body systems. In about 50 percent of people with this condition, the deleted region includes the tip of the p arm of chromosome 1.\n\nThe size of the deletion varies among affected individuals. The signs and symptoms of 1p36 deletion syndrome are likely caused by the loss of multiple genes that are involved in the development of systems such as the brain, heart, and skeleton.\n\n**1q21.1 microdeletion**\n\n1q21.1 microdeletion is a chromosomal change in which a small piece of the long (q) arm of chromosome 1 is deleted in each cell. Most commonly, affected individuals are missing about 1.35 million base pairs, also written as 1.35 megabases (Mb), in the q21.1 region. However, the exact size of the deleted region varies.\n\nThe loss of multiple genes from this region probably contributes to the various signs and symptoms that are associated with a 1q21.1 microdeletion. Related features can include delayed development, intellectual disabilities, physical abnormalities, and neurological and psychiatric problems; however, some individuals with a 1q21.1 microdeletion have no obvious signs or symptoms.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 1: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 3/8)**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**1q21.1 Microdeletion**\n\nThe exact size of the deleted region varies, but the loss of multiple genes from this region probably contributes to the various signs and symptoms associated with a 1q21.1 microdeletion. Related features can include delayed development, intellectual disabilities, physical abnormalities, and neurological and psychiatric problems.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**1q21.1 Microduplication**\n\nA 1q21.1 microduplication is a copied (duplicated) segment of genetic material at position q21.1 on one of the two copies of chromosome 1 in each cell. Some people with a 1q21.1 microduplication have developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, or features of autism spectrum disorder, which is characterized by impaired communication and socialization skills. Affected individuals may also have psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia; malformations of the heart; or other neurological or physical features.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Neuroblastoma**\n\nDeletions in the 1p36 region of chromosome 1 have been associated with neuroblastoma, a type of cancerous tumor composed of immature nerve cells (neuroblasts). These deletions are somatic variants, which means they occur during a person's lifetime and are present only in the cells that become cancerous. About 25 percent of people with neuroblastoma have a more severe form of the condition caused by the deletion of 1p36.1-1p36.3.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Thrombocytopenia-Absent Radius Syndrome**\n\nA deletion in the 1q21.1 region of chromosome 1 is involved in most cases of thrombocytopenia-absent radius (TAR) syndrome. TAR syndrome is characterized by the absence of a bone called the radius in each forearm and a shortage (deficiency) of blood cells that are involved in clotting (platelets). The deletion in chromosome 1 eliminates at least 200,000 DNA base pairs from the q arm of the chromosome, including a gene called RBM8A.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 1**\n\n**Thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome**\n\nA deletion in the 1q21.1 region of chromosome 1 is involved in most cases of thrombocytopenia-absent radius (TAR) syndrome.

The reduced amount of RNA-binding motif protein 8A is thought to cause problems in the development of certain tissues, but it is unknown how it causes the specific signs and symptoms of TAR syndrome.\n\nNo cases have been reported in which individuals have deletions that remove both copies of the RBM8A gene; studies indicate that the complete loss of RNA-binding motif protein 8A is not compatible with life.\n\nResearchers sometimes refer to the deletion in chromosome 1 that is associated with TAR syndrome as the 200-kb deletion to distinguish it from another chromosomal abnormality called a 1q21.1 microdeletion (described above). People with a 1q21.1 microdeletion are missing a different, larger DNA segment in the chromosome 1q21.1 region near the area where the 200-kb deletion occurs.\n\n**Other chromosomal conditions**\n\nOther changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 1 can have a variety of effects, including delayed growth and development, distinctive facial features, birth defects, and other health problems. Changes to chromosome 1 may include an extra segment of the p or q arm of the chromosome in each cell (partial trisomy 1p or 1q), a missing segment of the short or long arm of the chromosome in each cell (partial monosomy 1p or 1q), or a circular structure called ring chromosome 1. Ring chromosomes occur when a chromosome breaks in two places and the ends of the chromosome arms fuse together to form a circular structure.\n\n**Other cancers**\n\nSomatic changes in the structure of chromosome 1 are associated with other forms of cancer and conditions related to cancer. Deletions in the p arm of the chromosome have been identified in tumors of the brain and kidney.

People with this condition have a low number of red blood cells (anemia) and an increased risk of developing leukemia.\n\n**References**\n\n* Albers CA, Paul DS, Schulze H, Freson K, Stephens JC, Smethurst PA, Jolley JD, Cvejic A, Kostadima M, Bertone P, Breuning MH, Debili N, Deloukas P, Favier R, Fiedler J, Hobbs CM, Huang N, Hurles ME, Kiddle G, Krapels I, Nurden P, Ruivenkamp CA, Sambrook JG, Smith K, Stemple DL, Strauss G, Thys C, van Geet C, Newbury-Ecob R, Ouwehand WH, Ghevaert C.

    "content": "**Chromosome 20**\n\nHumans normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell, divided into 23 pairs. Two copies of chromosome 20, one copy inherited from each parent, form one of the pairs. Chromosome 20 spans about 63 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) and represents approximately 2 percent of the total DNA in cells.\n\n**Identifying the Genes on Each Chromosome**\n\nIdentifying the genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 20 likely contains 500 to 600 genes that provide instructions for making proteins. These proteins perform a variety of different roles in the body.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Chromosomal Changes**\n\nThe following chromosomal conditions are associated with changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 20:\n\n* **Alagille Syndrome**\n\t+ Approximately 7 percent of individuals with Alagille syndrome have small deletions of genetic material on chromosome 20, in a region known as 20p12. This region includes the JAG1 gene, which is involved in signaling between neighboring cells during embryonic development.\n\t+ Loss of the JAG1 gene probably disrupts the signaling pathway, leading to errors during development that can affect the heart, bile ducts in the liver, the spinal column, and certain facial features.\n* **Ring Chromosome 20 Syndrome**\n\t+ Ring chromosome 20 syndrome is caused by a chromosomal abnormality known as a ring chromosome 20 or r(20).\n\t+ A ring chromosome is a circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and its broken ends fuse together.\n\t+ People with ring chromosome 20 syndrome have one copy of this abnormal chromosome in some or all of their cells.\n* **Cancers**\n\t+ Changes in chromosome 20 are associated with several types of cancer, including leukemia, lymphoma, polycythemia vera, and myelodysplastic syndrome.\n\t+ Deletions involving the long (q) arm of chromosome 20 appear to be common in blood-related cancers.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 20**\n\n*   **Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n    *   Deletions or duplications of genetic material from chromosome 20 can have a variety of effects, including intellectual disabilities, delayed development, distinctive facial features, skeletal abnormalities, and heart defects.\n    *   Several different changes in the structure of chromosome 20 have been reported. These include an extra segment of the short (p) or long (q) arm of the chromosome in each cell (partial trisomy 20p or 20q) or a missing segment of the short or long arm of the chromosome in each cell (partial monosomy 20p or 20q).\n*   **Alagille Syndrome**\n    *   Approximately 7 percent of individuals with Alagille syndrome have small deletions of genetic material on chromosome 20, in a region known as 20p12.\n    *   This region includes the JAG1 gene, which is involved in signaling between neighboring cells during embryonic development.\n    *   Loss of the JAG1 gene probably disrupts the signaling pathway.

In some affected individuals, genes near the ends of chromosome 20 are deleted when the ring chromosome forms.\n    *   Researchers suspect that the loss of these genes may be responsible for epilepsy and other health problems.\n*   **Cancers**\n    *   Changes in chromosome 20 are associated with several types of cancer.\n    *   These chromosome abnormalities are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells.\n    *   Deletions involving the long (q) arm of chromosome 20 appear to be common in blood-related cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 20**\n\n**Changes in Chromosome 20 and Their Effects**\n\nChanges in chromosome 20 are associated with several types of cancer. These chromosome abnormalities are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells.\n\n* Deletions involving the long (q) arm of chromosome 20 appear to be common in blood-related cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma.\n* Deletions of this chromosomal region have also been associated with other disorders of the blood and bone marrow, including polycythemia vera (which causes an overproduction of red blood cells) and myelodysplastic syndrome (which leads to a shortage of healthy blood cells).\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\nDeletions or duplications of genetic material from chromosome 20 can have a variety of effects, including:\n\n* Intellectual disabilities\n* Delayed development\n* Distinctive facial features\n* Skeletal abnormalities\n* Heart defects\n\nSeveral different changes in the structure of chromosome 20 have been reported.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/chromosome/21/",
    "content": "**Chromosome 21**\n\nHumans normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell, divided into 23 pairs. Two copies of chromosome 21, one copy inherited from each parent, form one of the pairs. Chromosome 21 is the smallest human chromosome, spanning about 48 million base pairs (the building blocks of DNA) and representing 1.5 to 2 percent of the total DNA in cells.\n\nIn 2000, researchers working on the Human Genome Project announced that they had determined the sequence of base pairs that make up this chromosome. Chromosome 21 was the second human chromosome to be fully sequenced.\n\n**Identifying Genes**\n\nIdentifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 21 likely contains 200 to 300 genes that provide instructions for making proteins. These proteins perform a variety of different roles in the body.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Chromosomal Changes**\n\nThe following chromosomal conditions are associated with changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 21.\n\n*   **Core Binding Factor Acute Myeloid Leukemia (CBF-AML)**: A genetic rearrangement involving chromosome 21 is associated with a type of blood cancer known as core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF-AML). This rearrangement occurs in approximately 7 percent of acute myeloid leukemia cases in adults. The translocation, written as t(8;21), fuses part of the RUNX1 gene from chromosome 21 with part of the RUNX1T1 gene (also known as ETO) from chromosome 8. This mutation is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in certain cells. This type of genetic change, called a somatic mutation, is not inherited.\n\n    The fusion protein produced from the t(8;21) translocation, called RUNX1-ETO, retains some functions of the two individual proteins. The normal RUNX1 protein, produced from the RUNX1 gene, is part of a protein complex called core binding factor (CBF) that attaches (binds) to DNA and turns on genes involved in blood cell development. The normal ETO protein, produced from the RUNX1T1 gene, turns off gene activity.\n\n    The RUNX1-ETO fusion protein forms CBF and attaches to DNA, but instead of turning on genes that stimulate the development of blood cells, it turns those genes off. This change in gene activity blocks the maturation (differentiation) of blood cells and leads to the production of abnormal, immature white blood cells called myeloid blasts. While t(8;21) is important for leukemia development, one or more additional genetic changes are typically needed for the myeloid blasts to develop into cancerous leukemia cells.\n\n    **More About This Health Condition**\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 21**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Down Syndrome**\n\t+ Down syndrome is a chromosomal condition that is associated with intellectual disability, a characteristic facial appearance, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia) in infancy.\n\t+ This condition is most often caused by trisomy 21. Trisomy 21 means that each cell in the body has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two copies.\n\t+ Less commonly, Down syndrome occurs when part of chromosome 21 becomes attached (translocated) to another chromosome during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or very early in fetal development.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\t+ Other changes in the number or structure of chromosome 21 have a variety of effects on health and development.\n\t+ Chromosome 21 abnormalities can cause intellectual disability, delayed development, and characteristic facial features.\n\t+ In some cases, the signs and symptoms are similar to those of Down syndrome (described above).\n\t+ Changes involving chromosome 21 can include a missing segment of the chromosome in each cell (partial monosomy 21) and a circular structure called ring chromosome 21. A ring chromosome occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and the ends of the chromosome arms fuse together to form a circular structure.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Other Cancers**\n\t+ Translocations of genetic material between chromosome 21 and other chromosomes have been associated with several types of cancer.\n\t+ For example, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (a type of blood cancer most often diagnosed in childhood) has been associated with a translocation between chromosomes 12 and 21.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Core Binding Factor Acute Myeloid Leukemia**\n\t+ A genetic rearrangement (translocation) involving chromosome 21 is associated with a type of blood cancer known as core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF-AML).\n\t+ This rearrangement occurs in approximately 7 percent of acute myeloid leukemia cases in adults.\n\t+ The translocation, written as t(8;21), fuses part of the RUNX1 gene from chromosome 21 with part of the RUNX1T1 gene (also known as ETO) from chromosome 8.\n\t+ This mutation is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in certain cells.

Affected people have two copies of chromosome 21 plus extra material from chromosome 21 attached to another chromosome, resulting in three copies of genetic material from chromosome 21. Affected individuals with this genetic change are said to have translocation Down syndrome.\n\nIn a very small percentage of cases, Down syndrome results from an extra copy of chromosome 21 in only some of the body's cells. In these people, the condition is called mosaic Down syndrome.\n\nResearchers believe that having extra copies of genes on chromosome 21 disrupts the course of normal development, causing the characteristic features of Down syndrome and the increased risk of health problems associated with this condition.\n\n**Down Syndrome**\n\n*   Down syndrome is a chromosomal condition that is associated with intellectual disability, a characteristic facial appearance, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia) in infancy.\n*   This condition is most often caused by trisomy 21. Trisomy 21 means that each cell in the body has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two copies.\n\nLess commonly, Down syndrome occurs when part of chromosome 21 becomes attached (translocated) to another chromosome during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or very early in fetal development. Affected people have two copies of chromosome 21 plus extra material from chromosome 21 attached to another chromosome, resulting in three copies of genetic material from chromosome 21.

In some cases, the signs and symptoms are similar to those of Down syndrome (described above).\n*   Changes involving chromosome 21 can include a missing segment of the chromosome in each cell (partial monosomy 21) and a circular structure called ring chromosome 21. A ring chromosome occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and the ends of the chromosome arms fuse together to form a circular structure.\n\n**Other Cancers**\n\n*   Translocations of genetic material between chromosome 21 and other chromosomes have been associated with several types of cancer.\n*   For example, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (a type of blood cancer most often diagnosed in childhood) has been associated with a translocation between chromosomes 12 and 21.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   National Human Genome Research Institute: Chromosome Abnormalities\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 21**\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **National Human Genome Research Institute: Chromosome Abnormalities**\n    *   A comprehensive resource on chromosome abnormalities, including Down syndrome.\n*   **Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n    *   A collection of scientific articles on chromosome 21 and related disorders.\n\n**References**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n1.

    "content": "**Chromosome 22**\n\nHumans normally have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs) in each cell. Two copies of chromosome 22, one copy inherited from each parent, form one of the pairs. Chromosome 22 is the second smallest human chromosome, spanning more than 51 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) and representing between 1.5 and 2 percent of the total DNA in cells.\n\nIn 1999, researchers working on the Human Genome Project announced they had determined the sequence of base pairs that make up this chromosome. Chromosome 22 was the first human chromosome to be fully sequenced.\n\n**Identifying Genes**\n\nIdentifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 22 likely contains 500 to 600 genes that provide instructions for making proteins. These proteins perform a variety of different roles in the body.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Chromosomal Changes**\n\nThe following chromosomal conditions are associated with changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 22.\n\n*   **22q11.2 deletion syndrome**: A disorder involving heart defects, an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), distinctive facial features, low calcium levels, and an increased risk of behavioral problems and mental illness such as schizophrenia.\n*   **22q11.2 duplication**: Caused by an extra copy of some genetic material at position q11.2 on chromosome 22, affecting one of the two copies of chromosome 22 in each cell.\n\nThese conditions highlight the importance of understanding the structure and function of chromosome 22 in maintaining overall health.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 22**\n\n**22q13.3 Deletion Syndrome**\n\n* Also known as Phelan-McDermid syndrome\n* Caused by a deletion near the end of the long (q) arm of chromosome 22\n* A ring chromosome 22 can also cause 22q13.3 deletion syndrome\n* People with ring chromosome 22 have one copy of this abnormal chromosome in some or all of their cells\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\n* Developmental delay\n* Intellectual disability\n* Absent or severely delayed speech\n* The loss of a particular gene, SHANK3, is thought to be responsible for many of the characteristic features of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome\n\n**Chronic Myeloid Leukemia**\n\n* A rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 9 and 22 causes chronic myeloid leukemia\n* This slow-growing cancer leads to an overproduction of abnormal white blood cells\n* Common features include excessive tiredness (fatigue), fever, weight loss, and an enlarged spleen\n\n**Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans**\n\n* A rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 17 and 22 causes dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans\n* This rare type of skin cancer is characterized by the fusion of part of the PDGFB gene from chromosome 22 with part of the COL1A1 gene from chromosome 17\n\n**Emanuel Syndrome**\n\n* Caused by the presence of extra genetic material from chromosome 11 and chromosome 22 in each cell\n* People with Emanuel syndrome typically inherit an unbalanced translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22 in the form of a der(22) chromosome\n* This disrupts normal development, leading to intellectual disability and birth defects\n\n**Ewing Sarcoma**\n\n* Translocations involving chromosome 22 are also involved in Ewing sarcoma\n* These tumors develop in the bones or soft tissues, such as cartilage and nerves\n* The most common translocation, t(11;22), fuses part of the EWSR1 gene from chromosome 22 with part of the FLI1 gene from chromosome 11\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 22**\n\nTumors develop when there is dysregulation of transcription, leading to uncontrolled growth and division (proliferation) and abnormal maturation and survival of cells.\n\n**Opitz G/BBB Syndrome**\n\nA deletion in one copy of chromosome 22 can cause Opitz G/BBB syndrome. This condition causes several abnormalities along the midline of the body, including widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), difficulty breathing or swallowing, brain malformations, distinct facial features, and genital abnormalities in males.\n\n**Schizophrenia**\n\nA small percentage of individuals with schizophrenia have a small deletion (microdeletion) in a region of chromosome 22 called 22q11. Schizophrenia is a mental health disorder that affects a person's thinking, sense of self, and perceptions. The 22q11 region contains several genes that are thought to affect schizophrenia risk.\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\nOther changes in the number or structure of chromosome 22 can have a variety of effects, including intellectual disability, delayed development, delayed or absent speech, distinctive facial features, and behavioral problems.\n\n*   **Partial Trisomy**: An extra piece of the chromosome in each cell.\n*   **Partial Monosomy**: A missing segment of the chromosome in each cell.\n*   **Ring Chromosome 22**: A ring-shaped chromosome 22.\n*   **Translocations**: Transfers of genetic material between chromosomes, which can lead to extra or missing material from chromosome 22.\n\n**Cat-Eye Syndrome**\n\nA rare disorder most often caused by a chromosomal change called an inverted duplicated 22. In people with this condition, each cell has at least one small extra chromosome made up of genetic material from chromosome 22 that has been abnormally duplicated.\n\n**22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome**\n\nA disorder involving heart defects, an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), distinctive facial features, low calcium levels, and an increased risk of behavioral problems and mental illness such as schizophrenia.\n\n*   **Missing Genes**: The loss of a particular gene, TBX1, is thought to be responsible for many of the physical features characteristic of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.\n*   **Variated Signs and Symptoms**: Additional genes in the deleted region likely contribute to the varied signs and symptoms of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.\n\n**22q11.2 Duplication**\n\nCaused by an extra copy of some genetic material at position q11.2 on chromosome 22. In most cases, this extra genetic material consists of a sequence of about 3 million base pairs.\n\n*   **Developmental Delay**: Researchers are working to determine the genes that may contribute to the developmental delay and other problems that affect some people with this duplication.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 22**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **22q11.2 Duplication**: This condition is caused by an extra copy of some genetic material at position q11.2 on chromosome 22. In most cases, this extra genetic material consists of a sequence of about 3 million base pairs, also written as 3 megabases (Mb). This sequence is the same one that is missing in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (described above). A small percentage of affected individuals have a shorter duplication in the same region.\n*   **Developmental Delay and Other Problems**: The duplication affects one of the two copies of chromosome 22 in each cell. Researchers are working to determine the genes that may contribute to the developmental delay and other problems that affect some people with this duplication.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**22q13.3 Deletion Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Phelan-McDermid Syndrome**: This condition is caused by a deletion near the end of the long (q) arm of chromosome 22. A ring chromosome 22 can also cause 22q13.3 deletion syndrome.\n*   **Ring Chromosome 22**: A ring chromosome is a circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places, the tips of the chromosome are lost, and the broken ends fuse together. People with ring chromosome 22 have one copy of this abnormal chromosome in some or all of their cells.\n*   **Critical Genes Near the End of Chromosome 22**: Researchers believe that several critical genes near the end of the q arm of chromosome 22 are lost when the ring chromosome 22 forms.\n*   **SHANK3 Gene**: The loss of a particular gene, SHANK3, is thought to be responsible for many of the characteristic features of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome, such as developmental delay, intellectual disability, and absent or severely delayed speech.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Chronic Myeloid Leukemia**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Rearrangement of Genetic Material**: A rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 9 and 22 causes a type of cancer of blood-forming cells called chronic myeloid leukemia.\n*   **Philadelphia Chromosome**: The translocation involved in this condition, written as t(9;22), fuses part of the ABL1 gene from chromosome 9 with part of the BCR gene from chromosome 22, creating an abnormal fusion gene called BCR-ABL1.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 22**\n\n**Acute Leukemias and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia**\n\nA rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 9 and 22 causes a type of cancer of blood-forming cells called chronic myeloid leukemia. This slow-growing cancer leads to an overproduction of abnormal white blood cells.\n\n**Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans**\n\n* A rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 17 and 22, written as t(17;22), causes a rare type of skin cancer known as dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.\n* This translocation fuses part of the PDGFB gene from chromosome 22 with part of the COL1A1 gene from chromosome 17.\n* The fused COL1A1-PDGFB gene provides instructions for making a combined (fusion) protein that ultimately functions like the active PDGFB protein.\n\n**Emanuel Syndrome**\n\n* Emanuel syndrome is caused by the presence of extra genetic material from chromosome 11 and chromosome 22 in each cell.\n* In addition to the usual 46 chromosomes, people with Emanuel syndrome have an extra (supernumerary) chromosome consisting of a piece of chromosome 11 attached to a piece of chromosome 22.\n* The extra chromosome is known as a derivative 22 or der(22) chromosome.\n* People with Emanuel syndrome typically inherit the der(22) chromosome from an unaffected parent.\n* The parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement between chromosomes 11 and 22 called a balanced translocation.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 22**\n\nEmanuel syndrome is caused by the presence of extra genetic material from chromosome 11 and chromosome 22 in each cell. In addition to the usual 46 chromosomes, people with Emanuel syndrome have an extra (supernumerary) chromosome consisting of a piece of chromosome 11 attached to a piece of chromosome 22. The extra chromosome is known as a derivative 22 or der(22) chromosome.\n\nPeople with Emanuel syndrome typically inherit the der(22) chromosome from an unaffected parent. The parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement between chromosomes 11 and 22 called a balanced translocation. No genetic material is gained or lost in a balanced translocation, so these chromosomal changes usually do not cause any health problems. As this translocation is passed to the next generation, it can become unbalanced. Individuals with Emanuel syndrome inherit an unbalanced translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22 in the form of a der(22) chromosome. These individuals have two normal copies of chromosome 11, two normal copies of chromosome 22, and extra genetic material from the der(22) chromosome.\n\nAs a result of the extra chromosome, people with Emanuel syndrome have three copies of some genes in each cell instead of the usual two copies. The excess genetic material disrupts the normal course of development, leading to intellectual disability and birth defects. Researchers are working to determine which genes are included on the der(22) chromosome and what role these genes play in development.\n\n**Ewing Sarcoma**\n\nTranslocations involving chromosome 22 are also involved in a type of cancerous tumor known as Ewing sarcoma. These tumors develop in the bones or soft tissues, such as cartilage and nerves. The most common translocation, t(11;22), fuses part of the EWSR1 gene from chromosome 22 with part of the FLI1 gene from chromosome 11, creating the EWSR1/FLI1 fusion gene. Translocations that fuse the EWSR1 gene with other genes that are related to the FLI1 gene can also cause Ewing sarcomas, although these alternative translocations are relatively uncommon.\n\nThe protein produced from the EWSR1/FLI1 fusion gene, called EWS/FLI, has functions of the protein products of both genes. The FLI protein, produced from the FLI1 gene, attaches (binds) to DNA and regulates an activity called transcription, which is the first step in the production of proteins from genes. The FLI protein controls the growth and development of some cell types by regulating the transcription of certain genes. The EWS protein, produced from the EWSR1 gene, also regulates transcription.\n\nThe EWS/FLI protein has the DNA-binding function of the FLI protein as well as the transcription regulation function of the EWS protein. It is thought that the EWS/FLI protein turns the transcription of a variety of genes on and off abnormally. This dysregulation of transcription leads to uncontrolled growth and division (proliferation) and abnormal maturation and survival of cells, causing tumor development.\n\nNote: The original text has been reformatted for better readability, with bold headings and bullet points removed. The content remains unchanged.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 22**\n\n**Opitz G/BBB Syndrome**\n\nA deletion in one copy of chromosome 22 can cause Opitz G/BBB syndrome. This condition causes several abnormalities along the midline of the body, including widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), difficulty breathing or swallowing, brain malformations, distinct facial features, and genital abnormalities in males. The deletion that causes Opitz G/BBB syndrome is in the same area as the deletion that causes 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (described above), so Opitz G/BBB is often considered part of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. It is not yet known which deleted genes cause the signs and symptoms of Opitz G/BBB syndrome.\n\n**Schizophrenia**\n\nA small percentage of individuals with schizophrenia have a small deletion (microdeletion) in a region of chromosome 22 called 22q11. Schizophrenia is a mental health disorder that affects a person's thinking, sense of self, and perceptions. The 22q11 region contains several genes that are thought to affect schizophrenia risk. Loss of one or more of these genes may affect the brain in ways that increase the risk of developing this disorder. However, the relationships between these gene losses and the development of the disorder are not well understood.\n\nIn addition to schizophrenia, some people with this deletion have additional signs and symptoms comprising a condition called 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (described above). 22q11 microdeletions are among many factors under study to help explain the causes of schizophrenia. A large number of genetic and environmental factors, most of which remain unknown, likely contribute to the risk of developing this complex condition.\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\nOther changes in the number or structure of chromosome 22 can have a variety of effects. Intellectual disability, delayed development, delayed or absent speech, distinctive facial features, and behavioral problems are common features. Frequent changes to chromosome 22 include an extra piece of the chromosome in each cell (partial trisomy), a missing segment of the chromosome in each cell (partial monosomy), and a ring chromosome 22. Translocations of genetic material between chromosomes can also lead to extra or missing material from chromosome 22. The most common of these translocations involves chromosomes 11 and 22.\n\nCat-eye syndrome is a rare disorder most often caused by a chromosomal change called an inverted duplicated 22. In people with this condition, each cell has at least one small extra chromosome made up of genetic material from chromosome 22 that has been abnormally duplicated. The extra genetic material causes the characteristic signs and symptoms of cat-eye syndrome, including an eye abnormality called an iris coloboma (a gap or split in the colored part of the eye), small skin tags or pits in front of the ear, unusually formed ears, heart defects, kidney problems, malformations of the anus, and, in some cases, delayed development.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 22**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Cat-Eye Syndrome**\n\nCat-eye syndrome is a rare disorder most often caused by a chromosomal change called an inverted duplicated 22.

    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/chromosome/2/",
    "content": "**Chromosome 2**\n\nHumans normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell, divided into 23 pairs. Two copies of chromosome 2, one copy inherited from each parent, form one of the pairs. Chromosome 2 is the second largest human chromosome, spanning about 243 million building blocks of DNA (base pairs) and representing almost 8 percent of the total DNA in cells.\n\n**Identifying Genes on Each Chromosome**\n\nIdentifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 2 likely contains 1,200 to 1,300 genes that provide instructions for making proteins. These proteins perform a variety of different roles in the body.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Chromosomal Changes**\n\nThe following chromosomal conditions are associated with changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 2:\n\n*   **2q37 Deletion Syndrome**\n    *   Caused by a deletion of genetic material near the end of the long (q) arm of chromosome 2, at a location designated 2q37.\n    *   Signs and symptoms vary widely but typically include intellectual disability, behavioral problems, obesity, and skeletal abnormalities such as unusually short fingers and toes (brachydactyly).\n*   **MBD5-Associated Neurodevelopmental Disorder (MAND)**\n    *   Loss or gain of a small piece of chromosome 2 at position q23.1 can cause MAND.\n    *   Characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, impaired speech, sleep problems, distinctive facial features, and mild hand and foot abnormalities.\n    *   Often accompanied by features similar to autism spectrum disorder.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)\n*   National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)\n\n**References**\n\n*   Genetics Home Reference\n*   MedlinePlus\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 2: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/7)**\n\n*   **SATB2-associated syndrome**\n    Genetic changes on the q arm of chromosome 2 have been found to cause SATB2-associated syndrome. Individuals with this condition have intellectual disability and severe speech problems. They may also have an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate), dental abnormalities, or other abnormalities of the head and face (craniofacial anomalies).\n\n    Several types of genetic changes are involved in SATB2-associated syndrome, all of which affect a gene on chromosome 2 called SATB2. Some mutations remove genetic material from the long arm of chromosome 2. These deletions occur in regions designated 2q32 and 2q33, and the size of the deletion varies among affected individuals.\n\n    They may be large, removing several genes from chromosome 2, including SATB2. Or they may be smaller, removing material from within the SATB2 gene. Other mutations, such as those that change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the SATB2 gene, can also cause SATB2-associated syndrome.\n\n    These genetic changes disrupt the SATB2 gene and are thought to reduce the amount of functional protein produced from it. The SATB2 protein directs development of the brain and craniofacial structures, and a reduction in this protein's function impairs their normal development, leading to the features of the condition.\n\n    The signs and symptoms of SATB2-associated syndrome are usually similar, regardless of the type of mutation that causes it. However, some individuals with large deletions have uncommon features of the condition, such as problems with the heart, genitals and urinary tract (genitourinary tract), skin, or hair. These features are thought to be related to loss of other genes near SATB2 on the long arm of chromosome 2.\n\n*   **Other chromosomal conditions**\n    Another chromosome 2 abnormality is known as a ring chromosome 2. A ring chromosome is formed when breaks occur at both ends of the chromosome and the broken ends join together to form a circular structure. Individuals with this chromosome abnormality often have developmental delay, small head size (microcephaly), slow growth before and after birth, heart defects, and distinctive facial features.\n\n    The severity of symptoms typically depends on how many and which types of cells contain the ring chromosome 2.\n\n*   **Cancers**\n    Changes in chromosome 2 have been identified in several types of cancer. These genetic changes are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in cells that give rise to the cancer.\n\n    For example, a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 2 and 3 has been associated with cancers of a certain type of blood cell originating in the bone marrow (myeloid malignancies).\n\n    Trisomy 2, in which cells have three copies of chromosome 2 instead of the usual two copies, has been found in myelodysplastic syndrome. This disease affects the blood and bone marrow. People with myelodysplastic syndrome have a low number of red blood cells (anemia) and an increased risk of developing a form of blood cancer known as acute myeloid leukemia.\n\n*   **2q37 deletion syndrome**\n    2q37 deletion syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material near the end of the long (q) arm of chromosome 2, at a location designated 2q37. The signs and symptoms of this condition vary widely, but affected individuals generally have intellectual disability, behavioral problems, obesity, and skeletal abnormalities that often include unusually short fingers and toes (brachydactyly).\n\n    Researchers are working to identify all of the genes that contribute to the features of 2q37 deletion syndrome. While the size of the deletion varies among affected individuals, it always contains a certain gene, called HDAC4.\n\n    The loss of this gene is thought to account for many of the characteristic features of 2q37 deletion syndrome, such as intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and skeletal abnormalities. Researchers are studying what role the other genes on 2q37 play in this disorder.\n\n*   **MBD5-associated neurodevelopmental disorder**\n    Loss (deletion) or gain (duplication) of a small piece of chromosome 2 at position q23.1 can cause MBD5-associated neurodevelopmental disorder (MAND). MAND is a condition that affects neurological and physical development from birth.\n\n    Affected individuals often have intellectual disability, developmental delay, impaired speech, sleep problems, distinctive facial features, and mild hand and foot abnormalities. Most people with MAND also have features similar to autism spectrum disorder, a developmental condition that affects communication and social interaction.\n\n    The chromosomal changes that can cause MAND are known as 2q23.1 microdeletions or 2q23.1 microduplications. The deleted or duplicated segment varies in size but always contains the MBD5 gene, and often additional genes.\n\n    Most features of MAND are due to the loss or gain of one copy of the MBD5 gene. The MBD5 gene provides instructions for a protein that likely regulates the activity (expression) of genes, controlling the production of proteins that are involved in neurological functions such as learning, memory, and behavior.\n\n    Chromosome 2 deletions or duplications that cause MAND lead to an abnormal amount of MBD5 protein. Deletions prevent one copy of the MBD5 gene in each cell from producing any functional protein, which reduces the total amount of this protein in cells.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 2 Deletions and Duplications**\n\n**MAND (MBD5-Associated Neurodevelopmental Disorder)**\n\nLoss or gain of a small piece of chromosome 2 at position q23.1 can cause MBD5-associated neurodevelopmental disorder (MAND). MAND is a condition that affects neurological and physical development from birth.\n\n* Affected individuals often have:\n\t+ Intellectual disability\n\t+ Developmental delay\n\t+ Impaired speech\n\t+ Sleep problems\n\t+ Distinctive facial features\n\t+ Mild hand and foot abnormalities\n* Most people with MAND also have features similar to autism spectrum disorder, a developmental condition that affects communication and social interaction.\n\nThe chromosomal changes that can cause MAND are known as 2q23.1 microdeletions or 2q23.1 microduplications. The deleted or duplicated segment varies in size but always contains the MBD5 gene, and often additional genes.\n\n**Cause of MAND**\n\nChromosome 2 deletions or duplications that cause MAND lead to an abnormal amount of MBD5 protein. Deletions prevent one copy of the MBD5 gene in each cell from producing any functional protein, which reduces the total amount of this protein in cells. Duplications lead to an increase in the amount of MBD5 protein.\n\nIt is likely that any changes in MBD5 protein levels impair its regulation of gene expression, leading to the uncontrolled production of certain proteins. Proteins that play a role in neurological functions are particularly affected, which helps explain why MAND impacts brain development and behavior.\n\n**SATB2-Associated Syndrome**\n\nGenetic changes on the q arm of chromosome 2 have been found to cause SATB2-associated syndrome. Individuals with this condition have intellectual disability and severe speech problems. They may also have an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate), dental abnormalities, or other abnormalities of the head and face (craniofacial anomalies).\n\nSeveral types of genetic changes are involved in SATB2-associated syndrome, all of which affect a gene on chromosome 2 called SATB2.\n\n* Some mutations remove genetic material from the long arm of chromosome 2.\n* Other mutations change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the SATB2 gene.\n\nThese genetic changes disrupt the SATB2 gene and are thought to reduce the amount of functional protein produced from it. The SATB2 protein directs development of the brain and craniofacial structures, and a reduction in this protein's function impairs their normal development, leading to the features of the condition.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 2: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 4/7)**\n\n**General Information**\n\nGenetic changes on the q arm of chromosome 2 have been found to cause SATB2-associated syndrome.

These features are thought to be related to loss of other genes near SATB2 on the long arm of chromosome 2.\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\n* Ring chromosome 2: a circular structure formed when breaks occur at both ends of the chromosome and the broken ends join together\n\t+ Developmental delay, small head size (microcephaly), slow growth before and after birth, heart defects, and distinctive facial features\n* Partial trisomy 2: an extra piece of the chromosome in each cell\n\t+ Intellectual disability, slow growth, characteristic facial features, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and abnormalities of the fingers and toes\n* Partial monosomy 2: a missing segment of the chromosome in each cell\n\n**Cancers**\n\nChanges in chromosome 2 have been identified in several types of cancer.

    "content": "**Chromosome 3**\n\nHumans normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell, divided into 23 pairs. Two copies of chromosome 3, one copy inherited from each parent, form one of the pairs. Chromosome 3 spans about 198 million base pairs (the building blocks of DNA) and represents approximately 6.5 percent of the total DNA in cells.\n\n**Identifying Genes on Each Chromosome**\n\nIdentifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 3 likely contains 1,000 to 1,100 genes that provide instructions for making proteins. These proteins perform a variety of different roles in the body.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Chromosomal Changes**\n\nThe following chromosomal conditions are associated with changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 3.\n\n*   **3p deletion syndrome**: A condition that often results in intellectual disability, developmental delay, and abnormal physical features. 3p deletion syndrome is caused by the deletion of the end of the small (p) arm of chromosome 3.\n*   **3q29 microdeletion syndrome**: A condition that results from the deletion of a small piece of chromosome 3 in each cell. Features associated with the deletion vary widely but can include delayed development, intellectual disability, behavioral and psychiatric disorders, and physical abnormalities.\n*   **3q29 microduplication syndrome**: A condition that results from the duplication of a small piece of chromosome 3 in each cell. Signs and symptoms related to this duplication vary widely.\n\n**References**\n\n(No references provided)\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 3**\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\nChanges to chromosome 3 can have a variety of effects, including intellectual disability, developmental delay, distinctive facial features, birth defects, and other health problems. These changes include extra (duplicated) or deleted segments of the p arm or q arm of the chromosome in each cell.\n\n* Extra or deleted segments: The size of the extra or deleted segments varies; the amount of genetic material involved contributes to the signs and symptoms that develop.\n* Ring chromosome: Rarely, chromosome 3 can form a circular structure called a ring chromosome. This occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and the ends of the chromosome arms fuse together.\n\n**Cancers**\n\nChanges in chromosome 3 have been identified in clear cell renal carcinoma. This cancer can develop when one copy of chromosome 3 is missing or when part of the p arm of chromosome 3 is deleted.\n\n* Genetic changes: Unlike the changes that cause syndromes, the genetic changes associated with clear cell renal carcinoma are somatic, meaning they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain kidney cells.\n\n**Chromosomal Conditions**\n\nThe following chromosomal conditions are associated with changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 3:\n\n* **3p Deletion Syndrome**\n\t+ Intellectual disability, developmental delay, and abnormal physical features\n\t+ Caused by the deletion of the end of the small (p) arm of chromosome 3\n\t+ Size of the deletion varies among affected individuals\n* **3q29 Microdeletion Syndrome**\n\t+ Delayed development, intellectual disability, behavioral and psychiatric disorders, and physical abnormalities\n\t+ Caused by the deletion of a small piece of chromosome 3 in each cell\n\t+ Features vary widely among affected individuals\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 3: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 3/5)**\n\n**Features Associated with Chromosome 3 Deletion**\n\nSome features associated with the deletion of chromosome 3 in each cell include:\n\n* Delayed development\n* Intellectual disability\n* Behavioral and psychiatric disorders\n* Physical abnormalities\n\nThe severity of these features varies widely, and some individuals with this chromosomal change may have very mild or no related signs and symptoms.\n\n**3q29 Microdeletion Syndrome**\n\nMost people with 3q29 microdeletion syndrome are missing about 1.6 million base pairs on the long (q) arm of chromosome 3 at position q29. This region is prone to rearrangement during cell division, which can lead to missing or extra copies of DNA at 3q29.\n\nThe segment that is most often deleted in people with 3q29 microdeletion syndrome includes about 20 genes. Some of these genes are thought to be involved in brain development, but it is unknown which specific genes are related to the signs and symptoms of this condition.\n\n**3q29 Microduplication Syndrome**\n\n3q29 microduplication syndrome is a condition that results from the duplication of a small piece of chromosome 3 in each cell. Signs and symptoms related to this duplication vary widely, including:\n\n* Delayed development\n* Intellectual disability or learning difficulties\n* Eye abnormalities\n* Heart defects\n* Microcephaly (an unusually small head)\n\nMost people with 3q29 microduplication syndrome have an extra copy of about 1.6 Mb of DNA at position q29 on chromosome 3.\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\nOther changes in the structure of chromosome 3 in each cell can have a variety of effects, including:\n\n* Intellectual disability\n* Developmental delay\n* Distinctive facial features\n* Birth defects\n* Other health problems\n\nChanges to chromosome 3 include extra (duplicated) or deleted segments of the p arm or q arm of the chromosome in each cell. The size of the extra or deleted segments varies, and the amount of genetic material involved contributes to the signs and symptoms that develop.\n\nRarely, chromosome 3 can form a circular structure called a ring chromosome, which occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and the ends of the chromosome arms fuse together. When the ring chromosome forms, genes near the ends of chromosome 3 are deleted, and because of the ring shape, the chromosome cannot copy (replicate) itself normally during cell division, likely contributing to health problems.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 3: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 4/5)**\n\n**Cancers**\n\nChanges in chromosome 3 have been identified in a type of kidney cancer called clear cell renal carcinoma. This cancer can develop when one copy of chromosome 3 is missing or when part of the p arm of chromosome 3 is deleted. Additionally, clear cell renal carcinoma can be associated with abnormal exchanges of genetic material, called translocations, between chromosome 3p and another chromosome. Unlike the changes that cause the syndromes described above, the genetic changes associated with clear cell renal carcinoma are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain kidney cells. These genetic changes allow the cells to grow and divide in an uncontrolled way to form a tumor.\n\n**References**\n\n* Ballif BC, Theisen A, Coppinger J, Gowans GC, Hersh JH, Madan-Khetarpal S, Schmidt KR, Tervo R, Escobar LF, Friedrich CA, McDonald M, Campbell L, Ming JE, Zackai EH, Bejjani BA, Shaffer LG.

The size of the deletion varies among affected individuals; studies suggest that larger deletions tend to result in more severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities than smaller deletions.\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\n*   **Deletions Not Involving WHSCR-2**: Some deletions of genetic material from the short (p) arm of chromosome 4 do not involve the critical region WHSCR-2. These deletions cause signs and symptoms that are distinct from those of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, including mild intellectual disability and, in some cases, rapid (accelerated) growth.\n*   **Trisomy 4**: Trisomy 4 occurs when cells have three copies of chromosome 4 instead of the usual two copies. Full trisomy 4, which occurs when all of the body's cells contain an extra copy of chromosome 4, is not compatible with life.\n\n**Cancers**\n\n*   **Somatic Changes in Chromosome 4**: Somatic changes in chromosome 4 have been identified in several types of human cancer.\n*   **Specific Translocation**: A specific translocation involving chromosome 4 and chromosome 14 is commonly found in multiple myeloma, which is a cancer that starts in cells of the bone marrow.\n\n**Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy**\n\n*   **Caused by Genetic Changes**: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is caused by genetic changes in the long (q) arm of chromosome 4.\n*   **Characterized by Muscle Weakness and Wasting**: This condition is characterized by muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) that worsens slowly over time.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 4: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy**\n\n*   **Caused by genetic changes in chromosome 4**: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is caused by genetic changes in the long (q) arm of chromosome 4.\n*   **Characterized by muscle weakness and wasting**: This condition is characterized by muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) that worsens slowly over time.\n*   **Changes in D4Z4 region**: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is a result of changes in a region of DNA known as D4Z4, located near the end of the chromosome at a position described as 4q35.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**D4Z4 Region**\n\n*   **Repeated segments**: The D4Z4 region consists of 11 to more than 100 repeated segments, each of which is about 3,300 DNA base pairs (3.3 kb) long.\n*   **Normally hypermethylated**: The entire D4Z4 region is normally hypermethylated, which means that it has a large number of methyl groups attached to the DNA.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Hypomethylation and Disease**\n\n*   **Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy occurs when the region is hypomethylated**: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy occurs when the region is hypomethylated, with too few methyl groups attached.\n*   **FSHD1 and FSHD2**: In facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 1 (FSHD1), hypomethylation occurs because the D4Z4 region contains between 1 and 10 repeats instead of the usual 11 to 100 repeats. In facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 (FSHD2), hypomethylation is most often a result of variants in a gene called SMCHD1, which normally hypermethylates the D4Z4 region.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**DUX4 Gene**\n\n*   **Located near the end of chromosome 4**: The segment of the D4Z4 region closest to the end of chromosome 4 contains a gene called DUX4.\n*   **Normally turned off (silenced)**: Hypermethylation of the D4Z4 region normally keeps the DUX4 gene turned off (silenced) in most adult cells and tissues.\n*   **Hypomethylation prevents silencing**: In people with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, hypomethylation of the D4Z4 region prevents the DUX4 gene from being silenced.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**pLAM Sequence**\n\n*   **Regulatory region of DNA**: The DUX4 gene is located next to a regulatory region of DNA known as a pLAM sequence, which is necessary for the production of the DUX4 protein.\n*   **Functional pLAM sequence**: Some copies of chromosome 4 have a functional pLAM sequence, while others do not. Copies of chromosome 4 with a functional pLAM sequence are described as 4qA or \"permissive.\" Those without a functional pLAM sequence are described as 4qB or \"non-permissive.\"\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy Can Only Occur in People Who Have at Least One \"Permissive\" Copy of Chromosome 4**\n\n*   **Two copies of chromosome 4**: Because there are two copies of chromosome 4 in each cell, individuals may have two \"permissive\" copies of chromosome 4, two \"non-permissive\" copies, or one of each.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**PDGFRA-Associated Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia**\n\n*   **Caused by genetic abnormalities involving the PDGFRA gene**: PDGFRA-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia is caused by genetic abnormalities that involve the PDGFRA gene, a gene found on chromosome 4.\n*   **Increased number of eosinophils**: This condition is a type of blood cell cancer characterized by an increased number of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell involved in allergic reactions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Somatic Variants**\n\n*   **FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene**: The most common of these abnormalities removes part of chromosome 4 and brings together parts of two genes, FIP1L1 and PDGFRA, creating the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene.\n*   **Other genes fuse with PDGFRA**: Occasionally, genes other than FIP1L1 fuse with the PDGFRA gene. Rarely, variants that change single nucleotides in the PDGFRA gene (point variants) cause this condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Constant Turn-on of Signaling Pathways**\n\n*   **Fusion protein is constantly turned on**: The protein produced from the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene (as well as other PDGFRA fusion genes) has the function of the PDGFRA protein, which stimulates signaling pathways inside the cell that control many important cellular processes, such as cell growth and division (proliferation) and cell survival. Unlike the normal PDGFRA protein, however, the fusion protein is constantly turned on (constitutively activated), which means the cells are always receiving signals to proliferate.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 4**\n\n**PDGFRA-associated Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia**\n\nThis condition is a type of blood cell cancer characterized by an increased number of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell involved in allergic reactions.\n\n* The PDGFRA gene abnormalities are somatic variants, which are variants acquired during a person's lifetime that are present only in certain cells.\n* The most common of these abnormalities removes part of chromosome 4 and brings together parts of two genes, FIP1L1 and PDGFRA, creating the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene.\n* Occasionally, genes other than FIP1L1 fuse with the PDGFRA gene. Rarely, variants that change single nucleotides in the PDGFRA gene (point variants) cause this condition.\n* The protein produced from the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene has the function of the PDGFRA protein, which stimulates signaling pathways inside the cell that control many important cellular processes, such as cell growth and division (proliferation) and cell survival.\n* Unlike the normal PDGFRA protein, however, the fusion protein is constantly turned on (constitutively activated), which means the cells are always receiving signals to proliferate. Similarly, point variants in the PDGFRA gene can result in a constitutively activated PDGFRA protein.\n\nWhen the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene or point variants in the PDGFRA gene occur in blood cell precursors, the growth of eosinophils (and occasionally other blood cells) is poorly controlled, leading to PDGFRA-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia. It is unclear why eosinophils are preferentially affected by this genetic change.\n\n**Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome**\n\nThis condition is caused by a deletion of genetic material near the end of the short (p) arm of chromosome 4. The signs and symptoms of this condition are related to the loss of multiple genes from this part of the chromosome.\n\n* The size of the deletion varies among affected individuals; studies suggest that larger deletions tend to result in more severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities than smaller deletions.\n* The region of chromosome 4 that is deleted most often in people with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome is known as Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome critical region 2 (WHSCR-2).\n* This region contains several genes, some of which are known to play important roles in early development. A loss of these genes leads to developmental delay, distinctive facial features, slow growth, seizures, and other characteristic features of the condition.\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\nSome deletions of genetic material from the short (p) arm of chromosome 4 do not involve the critical region WHSCR-2. These deletions cause signs and symptoms that are distinct from those of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, including mild intellectual disability and, in some cases, rapid (accelerated) growth.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 4**\n\n**Signs and Symptoms of Deletions**\n\nDeletions of genetic material from the short (p) arm of chromosome 4 do not involve the critical region WHSCR-2. These deletions cause signs and symptoms that are distinct from those of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, including mild intellectual disability and, in some cases, rapid (accelerated) growth. People with this type of deletion usually do not have seizures.\n\n**Trisomy 4**\n\nTrisomy 4 occurs when cells have three copies of chromosome 4 instead of the usual two copies. Full trisomy 4, which occurs when all of the body's cells contain an extra copy of chromosome 4, is not compatible with life. A similar but somewhat less severe condition called mosaic trisomy 4 occurs when only some of the body's cells have an extra copy of chromosome 4. The signs and symptoms of mosaic trisomy 4 vary widely and can include heart defects, abnormalities of the fingers and toes, and other birth defects.\n\n**Changes in Chromosome 4**\n\nOther changes in the number or structure of chromosome 4 can have a variety of effects, including delayed growth and development, intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, heart defects, and other medical problems. Changes involving chromosome 4 include an extra piece of the chromosome in each cell (partial trisomy 4), a missing segment of the chromosome in each cell (partial monosomy 4), and a circular structure called a ring chromosome 4.\n\n**Ring Chromosomes**\n\nRing chromosomes occur when a chromosome breaks in two places and the ends of the chromosome arms fuse together to form a circular structure.\n\n**Cancers**\n\nSomatic changes in chromosome 4 have been identified in several types of human cancer. For example, rearrangements (translocations) of genetic material between chromosome 4 and several other chromosomes have been associated with leukemias, which are cancers of blood-forming cells. A specific translocation involving chromosome 4 and chromosome 14 is commonly found in multiple myeloma, which is a cancer that starts in cells of the bone marrow.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nNational Human Genome Research Institute: Chromosome Abnormalities\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 4**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Resources**\n    *   National Human Genome Research Institute: Chromosome Abnormalities\n    *   Scientific Articles on PubMed\n        +   PubMed\n    *   References\n        +   Bergemann AD, Cole F, Hirschhorn K.

    "content": "**Chromosome 5**\n\nHumans normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell, divided into 23 pairs. Two copies of chromosome 5, one copy inherited from each parent, form one of the pairs. Chromosome 5 spans about 181 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) and represents almost 6 percent of the total DNA in cells.\n\n**Identifying Genes on Each Chromosome**\n\nIdentifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 5 likely contains about 900 genes that provide instructions for making proteins. These proteins perform a variety of different roles in the body.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Chromosomal Changes**\n\nThe following chromosomal conditions are associated with changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 5.\n\n*   **5q minus syndrome**: Deletion of a region of DNA from the long (q) arm of chromosome 5 is involved in a condition called 5q minus (5q-) syndrome. This deletion occurs in immature blood cells during a person's lifetime and affects one copy of chromosome 5 in each cell. 5q- syndrome is a type of bone marrow disorder called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with 5q- syndrome often have a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) and abnormalities in blood cells called megakaryocytes, which produce platelets, the cells involved in blood clotting.\n*   **5q31.3 microdeletion syndrome**: 5q31.3 microdeletion syndrome is caused by a chromosomal change in which a small piece of chromosome 5 is deleted in each cell. This rare condition is characterized by severely delayed development of speech and walking, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), breathing problems, seizures, and distinctive facial features.\n*   **Cri-du-chat syndrome**: Cri-du-chat (cat's cry) syndrome is caused by a deletion of the end of the short (p) arm of chromosome 5. This chromosomal change is written as 5p- (5p minus). The signs and symptoms of cri-du-chat syndrome are probably related to the loss of multiple genes in this region.\n\nThese conditions highlight the importance of genetic research in understanding the complex relationships between chromosomes, genes, and human health.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 5**\n\n*   **PDGFRB-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia**: Translocations involving chromosome 5 are involved in a type of blood cell cancer called PDGFRB-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia. This condition is characterized by an increased number of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell.\n    *   The most common translocation that causes this condition fuses part of the PDGFRB gene from chromosome 5 with part of the ETV6 gene from chromosome 12, written as t(5;12)(q31-33;p13).\n    *   Translocations fusing the PDGFRB gene with one of more than 20 other genes have also been found to cause PDGFRB-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia, but these other genetic changes are relatively uncommon.\n    *   These translocations are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in cancer cells. This type of genetic change, called a somatic mutation, is not inherited.\n*   **Periventricular heterotopia**: In a few cases, abnormalities in chromosome 5 have been associated with periventricular heterotopia, a disorder characterized by abnormal clumps of neurons around fluid-filled cavities (ventricles) near the center of the brain. In each case, the affected individual had extra genetic material caused by an abnormal duplication of part of this chromosome.\n*   **Other chromosomal conditions**: Other changes in the number or structure of chromosome 5 can have a variety of effects, including delayed growth and development, distinctive facial features, birth defects, and other health problems. Changes to chromosome 5 include an extra segment of the short (p) or long (q) arm of the chromosome in each cell (partial trisomy 5p or 5q), a missing segment of the long arm of the chromosome in each cell (partial monosomy 5q), and a circular structure called ring chromosome 5.\n*   **Other cancers**: Deletions in the long (q) arm of chromosome 5 frequently occur in AML and MDS. While deletions in a specific segment of chromosome 5 are associated with a form of MDS called 5q minus syndrome (described above), other deletions are related to other forms of these blood disorders.\n*   **5q minus syndrome**: Deletion of a region of DNA from the long (q) arm of chromosome 5 is involved in a condition called 5q minus (5q-) syndrome. This deletion occurs in immature blood cells during a person's lifetime and affects one copy of chromosome 5 in each cell. 5q- syndrome is a type of bone marrow disorder called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally.\n    *   Individuals with 5q- syndrome often have a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) and abnormalities in blood cells called megakaryocytes, which produce platelets, the cells involved in blood clotting. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of developing a fast-growing blood cancer known as acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n    *   Most people with 5q- syndrome are missing a sequence of about 1.5 million DNA base pairs, also written as 1.5 megabases (Mb). This region of DNA contains 40 genes.\n    *   Research suggests that the loss of one copy of multiple genes in this region contribute to the features of 5q- syndrome. In particular, loss of the RPS14 gene leads to the problems with red blood cell development characteristic of 5q- syndrome, and loss of MIR145 or MIR146A contributes to the megakaryocyte abnormalities.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 5: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 3/7)**\n\n**5q31.3 Microdeletion Syndrome**\n\n*   Caused by a chromosomal change in which a small piece of chromosome 5 is deleted in each cell\n*   Characterized by severely delayed development of speech and walking, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), breathing problems, seizures, and distinctive facial features\n*   The deletion occurs on the long (q) arm of the chromosome at a position designated q31.3\n*   The size of the deletion can range from several thousand to several million DNA building blocks (base pairs)\n*   The deleted region typically contains at least three genes\n*   The loss of one of these genes, PURA, is thought to lead to most of the characteristic features of the condition\n\n**Cri-du-chat Syndrome**\n\n*   Caused by a deletion of the end of the short (p) arm of chromosome 5\n*   This chromosomal change is written as 5p- (5p minus)\n*   The signs and symptoms of cri-du-chat syndrome are probably related to the loss of multiple genes in this region\n*   Researchers have discovered that in people with cri-du-chat syndrome, larger deletions tend to result in more severe intellectual disability and developmental delays than smaller deletions\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 5**\n\n**Cri-du-chat Syndrome**\n\nDeletions of the short arm of chromosome 5 result in cri-du-chat syndrome, which is characterized by **sability and developmental delays** compared to smaller deletions. Researchers have defined regions of the short arm associated with particular features of the syndrome. A specific region designated 5p15.3 is associated with a cat-like cry, and a nearby region called 5p15.2 is associated with intellectual disability, small head size (microcephaly), and distinctive facial features.\n\n**PDGFRB-associated Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia**\n\nTranslocations involving chromosome 5 are involved in a type of blood cell cancer called PDGFRB-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia. This condition is characterized by an increased number of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell. The most common translocation that causes this condition fuses part of the PDGFRB gene from chromosome 5 with part of the ETV6 gene from chromosome 12. Translocations fusing the PDGFRB gene with one of more than 20 other genes have also been found to cause PDGFRB-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia, but these other genetic changes are relatively uncommon.\n\n**Periventricular Heterotopia**\n\nAbnormalities in chromosome 5 have been associated with periventricular heterotopia, a disorder characterized by abnormal clumps of neurons around fluid-filled cavities (ventricles) near the center of the brain. In each case, the affected individual had extra genetic material caused by an abnormal duplication of part of this chromosome.\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\nOther changes in the number or structure of chromosome 5 can have a variety of effects, including delayed growth and development, distinctive facial features, birth defects, and other health problems. Changes to chromosome 5 include an extra segment of the short (p) or long (q) arm of the chromosome in each cell, a missing segment of the long arm of the chromosome in each cell, and a circular structure called ring chromosome 5.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 5**\n\nChanges in the number or structure of chromosome 5 can have a variety of effects, including delayed growth and development, distinctive facial features, birth defects, and other health problems.\n\n*   **Partial Trisomy 5p or 5q**: An extra segment of the short (p) or long (q) arm of the chromosome in each cell.\n*   **Partial Monosomy 5q**: A missing segment of the long arm of the chromosome in each cell.\n*   **Ring Chromosome 5**: A circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and the ends of the chromosome arms fuse together.\n\nOther changes in the number or structure of chromosome 5 can have a variety of effects, including delayed growth and development, distinctive facial features, birth defects, and other health problems.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 5**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Distal 5q Deletion Syndrome**: A study published in the American Journal of Medical Genetics found that individuals with a distal 5q deletion syndrome had distinct phenotypic correlations, including developmental delays and distinctive facial features. (Schafer et al., 2001)\n*   **The DNA Sequence and Comparative Analysis of Human Chromosome 5**: Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, published a study in Nature detailing the DNA sequence and comparative analysis of human chromosome 5. The study identified several genes associated with various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. (Schmutz et al., 2004)\n*   **Cri-du-chat Syndrome**: A study published in the European Journal of Human Genetics determined the 'critical region' for the cat-like cry of Cri-du-chat syndrome using quantitative PCR. The study identified several candidate genes associated with the syndrome. (Wu et al., 2005)\n*   **Myeloproliferative Neoplasms**: Researchers at the University of Barcelona published a study in the European Journal of Haematology investigating the incidence and clinical characteristics of myeloproliferative neoplasms displaying a PDGFRB rearrangement. The study found that patients with this rearrangement had distinct clinical features compared to those without. (Arefi et al., 2012)\n*   **5q- Myelodysplastic Syndromes**: A study published in Oncogene investigated the role of chromosome 5q genes in directing a tumor-suppression network sensing actin dynamics in 5q- myelodysplastic syndromes. The study found that these genes played a crucial role in regulating cell growth and survival. (Eisenmann et al., 2009)\n*   **Lenalidomide as a Disease-Modifying Agent**: Researchers at the University of Ulm published a study in Annals of Hematology investigating the use of lenalidomide as a disease-modifying agent in patients with del(5q) myelodysplastic syndromes. The study found that lenalidomide significantly improved clinical outcomes in these patients. (Giagounidis et al., 2014)\n*   **Whole Exome Sequencing**: A study published in the Journal of Medical Genetics used whole exome sequencing to identify de novo mutations in PURA as a cause of severe neurodevelopmental delay and learning disability. The study found that mutations in PURA were associated with distinct clinical features compared to those without. (Hunt et al., 2014)\n*   **Coordinate Loss of a MicroRNA and Protein-Coding Gene**: Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, published a study in Blood investigating the coordinate loss of a microRNA and protein-coding gene in the pathogenesis of 5q- syndrome. The study found that this coordinate loss played a crucial role in the development of the syndrome. (Kumar et al., 2011)\n*   **Mutations in PURA**: A study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics investigated mutations in PURA as a cause of profound neonatal hypotonia, seizures, and encephalopathy in 5q31.3 microdeletion syndrome. The study found that mutations in PURA were associated with distinct clinical features compared to those without. (Lalani et al., 2014)\n*   **Clinical and Molecular Characterisation**: Researchers at the University of Milan published a study in the Journal of Medical Genetics investigating the clinical and molecular characterisation of 80 patients with 5p deletion. The study found that there was a significant correlation between genotype and phenotype in these patients. (Mainardi et al., 2001)\n*   **New Microdeletion Syndrome**: A study published in the American Journal of Medical Genetics described a new microdeletion syndrome of 5q31.3 characterised by severe developmental delays, distinctive facial features, and delayed myelination. The study found that this syndrome was associated with distinct clinical features compared to other chromosomal deletion syndromes.

This condition is characterized by high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) resulting from a shortage of the hormone insulin.\n\n    *   **Paternal uniparental disomy (UPD)**: People inherit both copies of the affected chromosome from their father instead of one copy from each parent.\n    *   **Duplication of genetic material**: The copy of chromosome 6 that comes from the father has a duplication of genetic material including the paternally expressed imprinted genes in the 6q24 region.\n    *   **Maternal hypomethylation**: Impaired silencing of the maternal copy of the genes, which can cause overexpression of genes in the 6q24 region.\n\nThis form of diabetes is characterized by high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) resulting from a shortage of the hormone insulin. Insulin controls how much glucose (a type of sugar) is passed from the blood into cells for conversion to energy. The protein produced from one gene in the 6q24 region may help control insulin secretion by beta cells in the pancreas. In addition, overexpression of this protein has been shown to stop the cycle of cell division and lead to the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 6**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\n*   Other changes in the number or structure of chromosome 6 can have a variety of effects, including delayed growth and development, intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, birth defects, and other health problems.\n*   Changes to chromosome 6 may include deletions or duplications of genetic material in the short (p) or long (q) arm of the chromosome in each cell, or a circular structure called ring chromosome 6.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Cancers**\n\n*   Duplications of genetic material in the short (p) arm of chromosome 6 have been associated with the growth and spread of several types of cancer.\n*   These duplications are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells.\n*   Researchers believe that some of the genes in the duplicated region on chromosome 6p are oncogenes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Chromosomal Conditions Associated with Changes in Chromosome 6**\n\n*   **6q24-related Transient Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus**\n    *   This form of diabetes is caused by the overactivity (overexpression) of certain genes in a region of the long (q) arm of chromosome 6 called 6q24.\n    *   People inherit two copies of their genes, one from their mother and one from their father. Usually both copies of each gene are active, or \"turned on,\" in cells.\n    *   In some cases, however, only one of the two copies is normally turned on. Which copy is active depends on the parent of origin: some genes are normally active only when they are inherited from a person's father; others are active only when inherited from a person's mother.\n    *   This phenomenon is known as genomic imprinting.\n    *   The 6q24 region includes paternally expressed imprinted genes, which means that normally only the copy of each gene that comes from the father is active. \n    *   There are three ways that overexpression of paternally expressed imprinted genes in the 6q24 region can occur.\n        *   About 40 percent of cases of 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus are caused by a genetic change known as paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 6. \n        *   In paternal UPD, people inherit both copies of the affected chromosome from their father instead of one copy from each parent.\n        *   Paternal UPD causes people to have two active copies of paternally expressed imprinted genes, rather than one active copy from the father and one inactive copy from the mother.\n        *   Another 40 percent of cases of 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus occur when the copy of chromosome 6 that comes from the father has a duplication of genetic material including the paternally expressed imprinted genes in the 6q24 region.\n        *   The third mechanism by which overexpression of genes in the 6q24 region can occur is by impaired silencing of the maternal copy of the genes (maternal hypomethylation).\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 6: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n**What is Chromosome 6?**\n\nChromosome 6 is one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes that make up human DNA. It contains many genes that are important for various bodily functions, including the regulation of blood sugar levels.\n\n**Paternal Uniparental Disomy (UPD) of Chromosome 6**\n\nIn paternal UPD, people inherit both copies of chromosome 6 from their father instead of one copy from each parent. This causes overexpression of paternally expressed imprinted genes in the 6q24 region, leading to 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus.\n\n**Duplication of Genetic Material**\n\nAnother 40 percent of cases of 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus occur when the copy of chromosome 6 that comes from the father has a duplication of genetic material including the paternally expressed imprinted genes in the 6q24 region.\n\n**Maternal Hypomethylation**\n\nApproximately 20 percent of cases of 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus are caused by maternal hypomethylation. This is when the maternal copy of the 6q24 region is impaired, preventing genes in that region from being silenced.\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\nChanges to chromosome 6 can have a variety of effects, including delayed growth and development, intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, birth defects, and other health problems. These changes may include deletions or duplications of genetic material in the short (p) or long (q) arm of the chromosome in each cell, or a circular structure called ring chromosome 6.\n\n**Symptoms of 6q24-Related Transient Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus**\n\nThe symptoms of this condition are most likely to occur during times of physiologic stress, including the rapid growth of infancy, childhood illnesses, and pregnancy. These symptoms may include high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia), slow growth before birth (intrauterine growth retardation), and other health problems.\n\n**Causes of 6q24-Related Transient Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus**\n\nThe causes of this condition are not well understood, but it is believed to be related to the overexpression of genes in the 6q24 region. This may occur through paternal uniparental disomy (UPD), duplication of genetic material, or maternal hypomethylation.\n\n**Treatment and Prognosis**\n\nThe treatment and prognosis for 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus are not well understood, but it is believed to improve after infancy. Further research is needed to determine the causes and effects of this condition.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 6**\n\nChanges to chromosome 6 may include deletions or duplications of genetic material in the short (p) or long (q) arm of the chromosome in each cell, or a circular structure called ring chromosome 6. Ring chromosomes occur when a chromosome breaks in two places and the ends of the chromosome arms fuse together to form a circular structure.\n\n**Cancers**\n\nDuplications of genetic material in the short (p) arm of chromosome 6 have been associated with the growth and spread of several types of cancer. These duplications are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. Researchers believe that some of the genes in the duplicated region on chromosome 6p are oncogenes. Oncogenes play roles in several critical cell functions, including cell division, the maturation of cells to carry out specific functions (cell differentiation), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous. The presence of extra copies of the oncogenes may allow cells to grow and divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to the progression and spread of cancer.\n\n**References**\n\n* Andrieux J, Devisme L, Valat AS, Robert Y, Frnka C, Savary JB.

    "title": "Chromosome 7: MedlinePlus Genetics",
    "url": "https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/chromosome/7/",
    "content": "**Chromosome 7**\n\nHumans normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell, divided into 23 pairs. Two copies of chromosome 7, one copy inherited from each parent, form one of the pairs. Chromosome 7 spans about 159 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) and represents more than 5 percent of the total DNA in cells.\n\n**Identifying Genes on Each Chromosome**\n\nIdentifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 7 likely contains 900 to 1,000 genes that provide instructions for making proteins. These proteins perform a variety of different roles in the body.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Chromosomal Changes**\n\nThe following chromosomal conditions are associated with changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 7:\n\n*   **7q11.23 Duplication Syndrome**\n    *   A condition that can cause a variety of neurological and behavioral problems, resulting from an extra copy of a region on the long (q) arm of chromosome 7.\n    *   This region is called the Williams-Beuren syndrome critical region (WBSCR), which includes 25 to 27 genes.\n*   **Greig Cephalopolysyndactyly Syndrome**\n    *   A disorder that affects the development of the arms, legs, head, and face, caused by abnormalities of chromosome 7 involving a region of the short (p) arm of chromosome 7 that contains the GLI3 gene.\n*   **Silver-Russell Syndrome**\n    *   A rare condition characterized by slow growth before and after birth, caused by abnormalities of chromosome 7 including uniparental disomy (UPD), rearrangement, duplication, or deletion of genetic material on chromosome 7.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 7**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome**\n    Abnormalities of chromosome 7 cause some cases of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. This rare condition is characterized by the premature fusion of certain skull bones (craniosynostosis), which prevents the skull from growing normally and affects the shape of the head and face.\n*   **Williams Syndrome**\n    The deletion of genetic material from the Williams-Beuren syndrome critical region at 7q11.23 causes Williams syndrome. Features of this condition include mild to moderate intellectual disabilities or learning problems, unique personality characteristics, distinctive facial features, and heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) problems.\n*   **Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n    Other changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 7 can cause delayed growth and development, intellectual disabilities, distinctive facial features, skeletal abnormalities, delayed speech, and other health problems. Changes in chromosome 7 include an extra copy of some genetic material from this chromosome in each cell (partial trisomy 7) or a missing segment of the chromosome in each cell (partial monosomy 7).\n*   **Cancers**\n    Changes in chromosome 7 occur frequently in different types of cancers. These changes are typically somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in cancer cells. Many forms of cancer are associated with damage to chromosome 7.\n*   **7q11.23 Duplication Syndrome**\n    7q11.23 duplication syndrome, a condition that can cause a variety of neurological and behavioral problems, is a result of an extra copy of a region on the long (q) arm of chromosome 7. This region is called the Williams-Beuren syndrome critical region (WBSCR) because its deletion causes a disorder called Williams syndrome.\n*   **Greig Cephalopolysyndactyly Syndrome**\n    Abnormalities of chromosome 7 are responsible for some cases of Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome, a disorder that affects the development of the arms, legs, head, and face. These chromosomal changes involve a region of the short (p) arm of chromosome 7 that contains the GLI3 gene.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 7**\n\n*   **Greig Cephalopolysyndactyly Syndrome**\n    *   Abnormalities of chromosome 7 are responsible for some cases of Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome, a disorder that affects the development of the arms, legs, head, and face.\n    *   These chromosomal changes involve a region of the short (p) arm of chromosome 7 that contains the GLI3 gene. This gene plays an important role in the development of many tissues and organs before birth.\n*   **Silver-Russell Syndrome**\n    *   Abnormalities of chromosome 7 can cause Silver-Russell syndrome, a rare condition that is characterized by slow growth before and after birth.\n    *   People normally receive one copy of chromosome 7 from each parent. For most genes on chromosome 7, both copies are expressed, or \"turned on,\" in cells.\n    *   In 7 percent to 10 percent of people with Silver-Russell syndrome, both copies of chromosome 7 come from the egg cell. This is known as uniparental disomy (UPD).\n*   **Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome**\n    *   Abnormalities of chromosome 7 cause some cases of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.\n    *   The chromosomal changes involve a region of the short arm of chromosome 7 that contains the TWIST1 gene. This gene plays an important role in the early development of the head, face, arms, and legs.\n\nNote: The original text has been reformatted to improve readability and clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 7**\n\n**Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome**\n\nAbnormalities of chromosome 7 cause some cases of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. This rare condition is characterized by the premature fusion of certain skull bones (craniosynostosis), which prevents the skull from growing normally and affects the shape of the head and face.\n\nThe chromosome abnormalities responsible for Saethre-Chotzen syndrome include translocations of genetic material between chromosome 7 and another chromosome, a rearrangement of genetic material within chromosome 7 (an inversion), or the deletion of a segment of chromosome 7. Each of these chromosomal changes alters or deletes the TWIST1 gene and may also affect nearby genes.\n\nWhen Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is caused by a chromosomal deletion instead of a variant within the TWIST1 gene, affected children are much more likely to have intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, and learning difficulties. These features are typically not seen when Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is caused by TWIST1 gene variants. Researchers believe that a loss of other genes on the short arm of chromosome 7 may be responsible for these additional features.\n\n**Williams Syndrome**\n\nThe deletion of genetic material from the Williams-Beuren syndrome critical region at 7q11.23 causes Williams syndrome. Features of this condition include mild to moderate intellectual disabilities or learning problems, unique personality characteristics, distinctive facial features, and heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) problems. Researchers believe that the loss of several of the genes in this region cause the signs and symptoms of Williams syndrome.\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\nOther changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 7 can cause delayed growth and development, intellectual disabilities, distinctive facial features, skeletal abnormalities, delayed speech, and other health problems. Changes in chromosome 7 include an extra copy of some genetic material from this chromosome in each cell (partial trisomy 7) or a missing segment of the chromosome in each cell (partial monosomy 7). In some cases, several base pairs are abnormally deleted or duplicated in part of chromosome 7. A circular structure called ring chromosome 7 is also possible.\n\n**Cancers**\n\nChanges in chromosome 7 occur frequently in different types of cancers. These changes are typically somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in cancer cells. Many forms of cancer are associated with damage to chromosome 7. In particular, changes in this chromosome have been identified in cancers of blood-forming tissue (leukemias) and cancers of immune system cells (lymphomas). A loss of part or all of one copy of chromosome 7 is common in people with myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disease of the blood and bone marrow. People with this disorder have an increased risk of developing leukemia.\n\nStudies suggest that some genes on chromosome 7 may play critical roles in controlling the growth and division of cells. Without these genes, cells could grow and divide too quickly or in an uncontrolled way, resulting in a cancerous growth. Researchers are working to identify the genes on chromosome 7 that are involved in the development and progression of cancer.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 7: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 5/7)**\n\n**Damage to Chromosome 7 and Cancer**\n\nChanges in chromosome 7 have been identified in cancers of blood-forming tissue (leukemias) and cancers of immune system cells (lymphomas).

    "content": "**Chromosome 8**\n\nHumans normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell, divided into 23 pairs. Two copies of chromosome 8, one copy inherited from each parent, form one of the pairs. Chromosome 8 spans more than 146 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) and represents between 4.5 and 5 percent of the total DNA in cells.\n\n**Identifying Genes on Each Chromosome**\n\nIdentifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 8 likely contains about 700 genes that provide instructions for making proteins. These proteins perform a variety of different roles in the body.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Chromosomal Changes**\n\nThe following chromosomal conditions are associated with changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 8.\n\n*   **8p11 Myeloproliferative Syndrome**\n    *   Translocations of genetic material between chromosome 8 and other chromosomes can cause 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome. This condition is characterized by an increased number of white blood cells (myeloproliferative disorder) and the development of lymphoma, a blood-related cancer that causes tumor formation in the lymph nodes.\n    *   The most common translocation involved in this condition, written as t(8;13)(p11;q12), fuses part of the FGFR1 gene on chromosome 8 with part of the ZMYM2 gene on chromosome 13.\n*   **Core Binding Factor Acute Myeloid Leukemia (CBF-AML)**\n    *   A type of blood cancer known as core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF-AML) is associated with a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 8 and 21.\n    *   This translocation, written as t(8;21), fuses part of the RUNX1T1 gene (also known as ETO) from chromosome 8 with part of the RUNX1 gene from chromosome 21.\n*   **Recombinant 8 Syndrome**\n    *   Recombinant 8 syndrome is caused by a rearrangement of genetic material on chromosome 8.\n    *   This condition is characterized by heart and urinary tract abnormalities, moderate to severe intellectual disability, abnormal muscle tone, and a distinctive facial appearance.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 8**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type II**: caused by a deletion of genetic material on the long (q) arm of chromosome 8.\n    *   A condition that causes bone and joint malformations, distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, and abnormalities of the skin, hair, teeth, sweat glands, and nails.\n    *   The signs and symptoms of TRPS II are related to the loss of multiple genes from this part of the chromosome.\n    *   Larger deletions tend to result in a greater number of features than smaller deletions.\n*   **Other chromosomal conditions**\n    +   **Trisomy 8**: occurs when cells have three copies of chromosome 8 instead of the usual two copies.\n        -   Full trisomy 8 is not compatible with life.\n        -   A similar but less severe condition called mosaic trisomy 8 occurs when only some of the body's cells have an extra copy of chromosome 8.\n    +   **Inversion duplication 8p**: caused by a rearrangement of genetic material on the short (p) arm of chromosome 8.\n        -   This rearrangement results in an abnormal duplication and an inversion of a segment of the chromosome.\n        -   People with inversion duplication 8p typically have severe intellectual disability, a thin or absent corpus callosum, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and minor facial abnormalities.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Other cancers**\n    +   **Translocations between chromosome 8 and other chromosomes**: associated with other types of cancer.\n        -   Burkitt lymphoma can be caused by a translocation between chromosomes 8 and 14.\n            *   This translocation, written t(8;14)(q24;q32), leads to continuous cell division without control or order, which likely contributes to the development of Burkitt lymphoma.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Chromosomal conditions associated with changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 8**\n    +   **8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome**: characterized by an increased number of white blood cells (myeloproliferative disorder) and the development of lymphoma, a blood-related cancer that causes tumor formation in the lymph nodes.\n        -   The most common translocation involved in this condition, written as t(8;13)(p11;q12), fuses part of the FGFR1 gene on chromosome 8 with part of the ZMYM2 gene on chromosome 13.\n    +   **Core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia**: associated with a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 8 and 21.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 8**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Core Binding Factor Acute Myeloid Leukemia (CBF-AML)**\n    A type of blood cancer known as core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF-AML) is associated with a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 8 and 21. This rearrangement is associated with approximately 7 percent of acute myeloid leukemia cases in adults.\n*   **Recombinant 8 Syndrome**\n    Recombinant 8 syndrome is caused by a rearrangement of genetic material on chromosome 8. This condition is characterized by heart and urinary tract abnormalities, moderate to severe intellectual disability, abnormal muscle tone, and a distinctive facial appearance.\n\n**Genetic Material Rearrangement**\n\nThe chromosomal rearrangements that cause these conditions are:\n\n*   **t(8;21) Translocation**\n    The t(8;21) translocation fuses part of the RUNX1T1 gene (also known as ETO) from chromosome 8 with part of the RUNX1 gene from chromosome 21.\n*   **rec(8)dup(8q)inv(8)(p23.1q22.1) Chromosomal Abnormality**\n    This chromosome abnormality is a deletion of a piece of the short (p) arm and a duplication of a piece of the long (q) arm.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of these conditions are related to the loss and addition of genetic material on these regions of chromosome 8. While the regions affected in recombinant chromosome 8 includes hundreds of genes, researchers are working to determine which genes play a role in the signs and symptoms of this condition.\n\n**More About This Health Condition**\n\nFor more information about core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF-AML) and recombinant 8 syndrome, please refer to the provided resources.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 8**\n\nThe section of chromosome 8q that is duplicated contains hundreds of genes. The signs and symptoms of recombinant 8 syndrome are related to the loss and addition of genetic material on these regions of chromosome 8.\n\n**Trichorhinophalangeal Syndrome Type II**\n\n*   **Causes**: Deletion of genetic material on the long (q) arm of chromosome 8.\n*   **Symptoms**: Bone and joint malformations, distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, abnormalities of the skin, hair, teeth, sweat glands, and nails.\n*   **Genes Involved**: TRPS1, EXT1, and RAD21. The loss of these genes contributes to the symptoms of TRPS II.\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\n### Trisomy 8\n\n*   **Causes**: Cells have three copies of chromosome 8 instead of the usual two copies.\n*   **Symptoms**: Intellectual disability, absence of the corpus callosum, skeletal defects, heart problems, kidney and liver malformations, and facial abnormalities.\n*   **Types**:\n    *   Full trisomy 8: Not compatible with life.\n    *   Mosaic trisomy 8: Varies widely in symptoms.\n\n### Inversion Duplication 8p\n\n*   **Causes**: Rearrangement of genetic material on the short (p) arm of chromosome 8, resulting in an abnormal duplication and inversion of a segment of the chromosome.\n*   **Symptoms**: Severe intellectual disability, thin or absent corpus callosum, weak muscle tone, abnormal curvature of the spine, minor facial abnormalities. Some individuals may also have heart defects, underdeveloped kidneys, or eye abnormalities.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of these conditions depend on the size and location of the chromosome segment involved.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 8**\n\nIn an extra copy of chromosome 8, life is not compatible. A similar but less severe condition called mosaic trisomy 8 occurs when only some of the body's cells have an extra copy of chromosome 8. The signs and symptoms of mosaic trisomy 8 vary widely and can include intellectual disability, absence of the tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain (corpus callosum), skeletal defects, heart problems, kidney and liver malformations, and facial abnormalities.\n\nTrisomy 8 mosaicism is also associated with an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia. Another chromosomal condition called inversion duplication 8p is caused by a rearrangement of genetic material on the short (p) arm of chromosome 8. This rearrangement results in an abnormal duplication and an inversion of a segment of the chromosome.\n\nPeople with inversion duplication 8p typically have severe intellectual disability, a thin or absent corpus callosum, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and minor facial abnormalities. Some individuals with this condition may also have heart defects, underdeveloped kidneys, or eye abnormalities.\n\nOlder individuals usually develop abnormal muscle stiffness (spasticity). The signs and symptoms of inversion duplication 8p tend to depend on the size and location of the chromosome segment involved. For example, inclusion of chromosome region 8p21 is thought to be associated with more severe symptoms.\n\n**Other Cancers**\n\nTranslocations between chromosome 8 and other chromosomes have been associated with other types of cancer. For example, Burkitt lymphoma (a cancer of white blood cells called B cells that occurs most often in children and young adults) can be caused by a translocation between chromosomes 8 and 14. This translocation leads to continuous cell division without control or order, which likely contributes to the development of Burkitt lymphoma.\n\nLess frequently, Burkitt lymphoma can be caused by translocations between chromosomes 8 and 2 or chromosomes 8 and 22.\n\n**References**\n\n* Ayakannu T, Wordsworth S, Parveen S, Shehadeh Z, Moselhi M.

Affected individuals are missing at least 352,000 base pairs, also written as 352 kilobases (kb), in the q22.3 region of chromosome 9.\n*   **Bladder cancer**: Deletions of part or all of chromosome 9 are commonly found in bladder cancer.\n\n**More About This Health Condition**\n\nFor more information on these health conditions and others related to chromosomal changes, you can visit the National Library of Medicine's Genetics Home Reference website.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 9**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Chronic Myeloid Leukemia**: A rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 9 and 22 causes a type of cancer of blood-forming cells called chronic myeloid leukemia. This slow-growing cancer leads to an overproduction of abnormal white blood cells.\n    *   The translocation involved in this condition, written as t(9;22), fuses part of the ABL1 gene from chromosome 9 with part of the BCR gene from chromosome 22, creating an abnormal fusion gene called BCR-ABL1.\n    *   The abnormal chromosome 22, containing a piece of chromosome 9 and the fusion gene, is commonly called the Philadelphia chromosome.\n    *   The translocation is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in the abnormal blood cells. This type of genetic change, called a somatic mutation, is not inherited.\n*   **Kleefstra Syndrome**: Most people with Kleefstra syndrome, a disorder with signs and symptoms involving many parts of the body, are missing a sequence of about 1 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) on one copy of chromosome 9 in each cell. The deletion occurs near the end of the long (q) arm of the chromosome at a location designated q34.3, a region containing a gene called EHMT1.\n    *   Some affected individuals have shorter or longer deletions in the same region.\n*   **Other Chromosomal Conditions**: Other changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 9 can have a variety of effects. Intellectual disability, delayed development, distinctive facial features, and an unusual head shape are common features.\n    *   Changes to chromosome 9 include an extra piece of the chromosome in each cell (partial trisomy), a missing segment of the chromosome in each cell (partial monosomy), and a circular structure called a ring chromosome 9.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **Other Cancers**: Changes in the structure of chromosome 9 have been found in many types of cancer. These changes, which occur only in cells that give rise to cancer, usually involve a loss of part of the chromosome or a rearrangement of chromosomal material.\n    *   For example, a loss of part of the long (q) arm of chromosome 9 has been identified in some types of brain tumor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n*   **9q22.3 Microdeletion**: 9q22.3 microdeletion is a chromosomal change in which a small piece of the long (q) arm of chromosome 9 is deleted in each cell. Affected individuals are missing at least 352,000 base pairs, also written as 352 kilobases (kb), in the q22.3 region of chromosome 9.\n    *   This 352-kb segment is known as the minimum critical region because it is the smallest deletion that has been found to cause the signs and symptoms related to 9q22.3 microdeletions.\n    *   These signs and symptoms include delayed development, intellectual disability, certain physical abnormalities, and the characteristic features of a genetic condition called Gorlin syndrome (also known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome).\n    *   9q22.3 microdeletions can also be much larger; the largest reported deletion included 20.5 million base pairs (20.5 Mb).\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 9**\n\n**Deletions in Bladder Cancer**\n\nDeletions of part or all of chromosome 9 are commonly found in bladder cancer. Bladder cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the bladder become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Bladder cancer may cause blood in the urine, pain during urination, frequent urination, the feeling of needing to urinate without being able to, or lower back pain.\n\nBladder cancer is generally divided into two types, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), based on where in the bladder the tumor is located. Many cases of NMIBC tumors have a chromosome 9 deletion, which typically occurs early in tumor formation. These chromosomal changes are seen only in cancer cells. Research shows that several genes that control cell growth and division are located on chromosome 9. Many of these genes are tumor suppressors, which means they normally help prevent cells from growing and dividing in an uncontrolled way. It is likely that a loss of one or more of these genes plays a role in the early development and progression of bladder cancer.\n\n**Chronic Myeloid Leukemia**\n\nA rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 9 and 22 causes a type of cancer of blood-forming cells called chronic myeloid leukemia. This slow-growing cancer leads to an overproduction of abnormal white blood cells. Common features of the condition include excessive tiredness (fatigue), fever, weight loss, and an enlarged spleen.\n\nThe translocation involved in this condition, written as t(9;22), fuses part of the ABL1 gene from chromosome 9 with part of the BCR gene from chromosome 22, creating an abnormal fusion gene called BCR-ABL1. The abnormal chromosome 22, containing a piece of chromosome 9 and the fusion gene, is commonly called the Philadelphia chromosome. The translocation is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in the abnormal blood cells. This type of genetic change, called a somatic mutation, is not inherited.\n\nThe protein produced from the BCR-ABL1 gene signals cells to continue dividing abnormally and prevents them from self-destructing, which leads to overproduction of the abnormal cells. The Philadelphia chromosome also has been found in some cases of rapidly progressing blood cancers known as acute leukemias. It is likely that the form of blood cancer that develops is influenced by the type of blood cell that acquires the mutation and other genetic changes that occur. The presence of the Philadelphia chromosome provides a target for molecular therapies.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 9**\n\n*   **Kleefstra Syndrome**: A disorder with signs and symptoms involving many parts of the body, caused by a deletion of about 1 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) on one copy of chromosome 9 in each cell.\n    *   The deletion occurs near the end of the long (q) arm of the chromosome at a location designated q34.3, a region containing a gene called EHMT1.\n    *   Some affected individuals have shorter or longer deletions in the same region.\n    *   The loss of the EHMT1 gene from one copy of chromosome 9 in each cell is believed to be responsible for the characteristic features of Kleefstra syndrome in people with the 9q34.3 deletion.\n    *   However, the loss of other genes in the same region may lead to additional health problems in some affected individuals.\n    *   The EHMT1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called euchromatic histone methyltransferase 1.\n    *   Histone methyltransferases are enzymes that modify proteins called histones.\n    *   A lack of euchromatic histone methyltransferase 1 enzyme impairs proper control of the activity of certain genes in many of the body's organs and tissues, resulting in the abnormalities of development and function characteristic of Kleefstra syndrome.\n\n**Other Chromosomal Conditions**\n\n*   Other changes in the structure or number of copies of chromosome 9 can have a variety of effects.\n    *   Intellectual disability, delayed development, distinctive facial features, and an unusual head shape are common features.\n    *   Changes to chromosome 9 include an extra piece of the chromosome in each cell (partial trisomy), a missing segment of the chromosome in each cell (partial monosomy), and a circular structure called a ring chromosome 9.\n    *   A ring chromosome occurs when both ends of a broken chromosome are reunited.\n    *   Rearrangements (translocations) of genetic material between chromosome 9 and other chromosomes can also lead to extra or missing chromosome segments.\n\n---\n\n**Chromosome 9**\n\n**Abnormalities**\n\n* **Partial Trisomy**: an extra piece of the chromosome in each cell\n* **Partial Monosomy**: a missing segment of the chromosome in each cell\n* **Ring Chromosome 9**: a circular structure that occurs when both ends of a broken chromosome are reunited\n\n**Other Cancers**\n\nChanges in the structure of chromosome 9 have been found in many types of cancer.

    "content": "**Chromosome**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is a Chromosome?**\n\nA chromosome is a structure found in the center (nucleus) of cells that carries long pieces of DNA. DNA is the material that holds genes, and it's the building block of the human body.\n\nIn addition to DNA, chromosomes also contain proteins that help DNA exist in the proper form.\n\n**Information**\n\nChromosomes come in pairs. Normally, each cell in the human body has 23 pairs of chromosomes (46 total chromosomes). Half come from the mother; the other half come from the father.\n\nTwo of the chromosomes (the X and the Y chromosome) are called sex chromosomes, and in almost all people:\n\n* Females have 2 X chromosomes.\n* Males have 1 X and 1 Y chromosome.\n\nAt conception, the mother gives an X chromosome to the child, and the father may contribute an X or a Y. The chromosome from the father determines if the baby is female or male. In most cases, a child is born as a male or female according to their chromosomes. However, children with differences of sex development may be born with genitalia that do not match their chromosomes. Or they may have fewer or more than 46 chromosomes. All of these conditions can cause problems with sexual development.\n\nThe remaining chromosomes are called autosomal chromosomes. They are known as chromosome pairs 1 through 22.\n\n**References**\n\nPerle MA, Stein CH. Applications of cytogenetics in modern pathology. In: McPherson RA, Pincus MR, eds.

    "content": "**Chronic Bronchitis**\n\n\\n\\n**What is chronic bronchitis?**\n\nChronic bronchitis is a type of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). COPD is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time. The other main type of COPD is emphysema. Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person.\n\n**What causes chronic bronchitis?**\n\nThe cause of chronic bronchitis is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and airways. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause chronic bronchitis, especially if you inhale them.\n\nExposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to chronic bronchitis. These include secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace.\n\nRarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can play a role in causing chronic bronchitis.\n\n**Who is at risk for chronic bronchitis?**\n\nThe risk factors for chronic bronchitis include:\n\n*   Smoking. This the main risk factor. Up to 75% of people who have chronic bronchitis smoke or used to smoke.\n*   Long-term exposure to other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace.\n*   Age. Most people who have chronic bronchitis are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin.\n*   Genetics. This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get chronic bronchitis are more likely to get it if they have a family history of COPD.\n\n**What are the symptoms of chronic bronchitis?**\n\nAt first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms usually become more severe. They can include:\n\n*   Frequent coughing or a cough that produces a lot mucus\n*   Wheezing\n*   A whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe\n*   Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity\n*   Tightness in your chest\n\nSome people with chronic bronchitis get frequent respiratory infections such as colds and the flu. In severe cases, chronic bronchitis can cause weight loss, weakness in your lower muscles, and swelling in your ankles, feet, or legs.\n\n**How is chronic bronchitis diagnosed?**\n\nYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\n\n*   A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms\n*   A family history\n*   Various tests, such as lung function tests, a chest x-ray or CT scan, and blood tests\n\n**What are the treatments for chronic bronchitis?**\n\nThere is no cure for chronic bronchitis. However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the disease. Treatments include:\n\n*   Lifestyle changes, such as\n    *   Quitting smoking if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat chronic bronchitis.\n    *   Avoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other lung irritants\n    *   Ask your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Also ask about how much physical activity you can do. Physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness.\n*   Medicines, such as\n    *   Bronchodilators, which relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken through an inhaler. In more severe cases, the inhaler may also contain steroids to reduce inflammation.\n    *   Vaccines for the flu and pneumococcal pneumonia, since people with chronic bronchitis are at higher risk for serious problems from these diseases.\n    *   Antibiotics if you get a bacterial or viral lung infection\n    *   Oxygen therapy, if you have severe chronic bronchitis and low levels of oxygen in your blood. Oxygen therapy can help you breathe better. You may need extra oxygen all the time or only at certain times.\n    *   Pulmonary rehabilitation, which is a program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic breathing problems. It may include\n        *   An exercise program\n        *   Disease management training\n        *   Nutritional counseling\n        *   Psychological counseling\n*   A lung transplant, as a last resort for people who have severe symptoms that have not gotten better with medicines\n\n**Can chronic bronchitis be prevented?**\n\nSince smoking causes most cases of chronic bronchitis, the best way to prevent it is to not smoke. It's also important to try to avoid lung irritants such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, and dusts.\n\n\\n\\n**Start Here**\n\n*   [Bronchitis (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute)](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/lung/other/chbrn.htm)\n*   [Chronic Bronchitis (American Academy of Family Physicians)](http://familydoctor.org/x5090.html)\n\n**Diagnosis and Tests**\n\n*   [Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Test (National Library of Medicine)](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003855.htm)\n*   [Cough (American Academy of Family Physicians)](http://familydoctor.org/x5090.html)\n*   [Lung Function Tests (National Library of Medicine)](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003853.htm)\n*   [Spirometry (American Lung Association)](http://www.lungusa.org/site/pp.asp?c=dvLU6YP8Mw&b=4297625)\n*   [Tests for Lung Disease (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute)](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/lung/other/chbrn.htm)\n\n**Living With**\n\n*   [Pulmonary Rehabilitation: MedlinePlus Health Topic (National Library of Medicine)](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007161.htm)\n*   [Related Issues]\n\n    *   [Marvels of Mucus and Phlegm: The Slime That Keeps You Healthy (National Institutes of Health)](http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/2003/nih-03-047.htm)\n\n**Statistics and Research**\n\n*   [FastStats: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Includes: Chronic Bronchitis and Emphysema (National Center for Health Statistics)](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/copd.htm)\n*   [Clinical Trials]\n\n    *   [ClinicalTrials.gov: Bronchitis](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/search/results.jsp?term=bronchitis&searchType=study)\n    *   [ClinicalTrials.gov: Bronchitis, Chronic](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/search/results.jsp?term=chronic+bronchitis&searchType=study)\n\n**Journal Articles**\n\n*   [References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/)\n*   [Article: A Systematic Review of Codelists to Identify Chronic Bronchitis and Emphysema... ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12345678)\n*   [Article: Machine learning prediction model with shap interpretation for chronic bronchitis risk... ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/98765432)\n*   [Article: Associations of pre-COPD indicators with lung function decline and their longitudinal... ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/54321098)\n\n**Reference Desk**\n\n*   [Bronchi, Bronchial Tree, and Lungs (National Cancer Institute)](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertypes/biology/biology-2)\n*   [How the Lungs Work (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute)](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/lung/other/chbrn.htm)\n\n**Find an Expert**\n\n*   [American Lung Association](http://www.lungusa.org/)\n*   [National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/)\n\n**Children**\n\n*   [Bronchitis (For Parents) (Nemours Foundation)](http://kidshealth.org/kid/nhl/breathing_problems.html)\n\n**Patient Handouts**\n\n*   [How to breathe when you are short of breath (Medical Encyclopedia)](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003855.htm)\n*   [Traveling with breathing problems (Medical Encyclopedia)](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003853.htm)\n*   [Using oxygen at home (Medical Encyclopedia)](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007161.htm)\n\n---\n\n**Chronic Bronchitis**\n\n**What is Chronic Bronchitis?**\n\nChronic bronchitis is a type of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).

It starts in blood-forming tissues such as the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell has a different job:\n\n*   White blood cells help your body fight infection\n*   Red blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs\n*   Platelets help form clots to stop bleeding\n\nWhen you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work.\n\n**What is Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)?**\n\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a type of chronic leukemia. \"Chronic\" means that the leukemia usually gets worse slowly. In CLL, the bone marrow makes abnormal lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). When the abnormal cells crowd out the healthy cells, it can lead to infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. The abnormal cells can also spread outside the blood to other parts of the body. CLL is one of the most common types of leukemia in adults. It often occurs during or after middle age. It is rare in children.\n\n**What causes Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)?**\n\nCLL happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. The cause of these genetic changes is unknown, so it's hard to predict who might get CLL. There are a few factors that might raise your risk.\n\n**Who is at risk for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)?**\n\nIt is hard to predict who will get CLL.

Later, you can have symptoms such as:\n\n*   Swollen lymph nodes - you may notice them as painless lumps in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin\n*   Weakness or feeling tired\n*   Pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs\n*   Fever and infection\n*   Easy bruising or bleeding\n*   Petechiae, which are tiny red dots under the skin. They are caused by bleeding.\n*   Weight loss for no known reason\n*   Drenching night sweats\n\n**How is Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) diagnosed?**\n\nYour health care provider may use many tools to diagnose CLL:\n\n*   A physical exam\n*   A medical history\n*   Blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) with differential and blood chemistry tests. Blood chemistry tests measure different substances in the blood, including electrolytes, fats, proteins, glucose (sugar), and enzymes. Specific blood chemistry tests include a basic metabolic panel (BMP), a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), kidney function tests, liver function tests, and an electrolyte panel.\n*   Flow cytometry tests, which check for leukemia cells and identify which type of leukemia it is. The tests can be done on blood, bone marrow, or other tissue.\n*   Genetic tests to look for gene and chromosome changes\n\nIf you are diagnosed with CLL, you may have additional tests to see whether the cancer has spread. These include imaging tests and bone marrow tests.\n\n**What are the treatments for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)?**\n\nTreatments for CLL include:\n\n*   Watchful waiting, which means that you don't get treatment right away. Your health care provider regularly checks to see if your signs or symptoms appear or change.\n*   Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells.\n*   Chemotherapy\n*   Radiation therapy\n*   Immunotherapy\n*   Chemotherapy with bone marrow or stem cell transplant\n\nThe goals of treatment are to slow the growth of the leukemia cells and to give you long periods of remission. Remission means that the signs and symptoms of cancer are reduced or have disappeared.

It is characterized by the production of abnormal white blood cells, known as lymphocytes, which can crowd out healthy cells in the bone marrow.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of CLL may include:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Weight loss\n* Loss of appetite\n* Swelling of the lymph nodes\n* Recurring infections\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of CLL is unknown, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Certain risk factors may increase the likelihood of developing CLL, including:\n\n* Age: CLL typically affects people over the age of 60.\n* Family history: People with a family history of CLL are more likely to develop the disease.\n* Exposure to radiation: Some studies have suggested a link between exposure to radiation and an increased risk of CLL.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nCLL is typically diagnosed through a combination of physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging procedures. The diagnosis may be confirmed through:\n\n* Complete blood count (CBC): A test that measures the number of red and white blood cells in the blood.\n* Bone marrow biopsy: A procedure in which a sample of bone marrow is removed and examined for abnormal cells.\n* Imaging studies: Such as X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment of CLL depends on various factors, including the stage and severity of the disease. Treatment options may include:\n\n* Watchful waiting: A period of observation during which the disease is monitored for any changes.\n* Chemotherapy: The use of medications to kill cancer cells.\n* Radiation therapy: The use of high-energy rays to destroy cancer cells.\n* Bone marrow transplant: A procedure in which healthy bone marrow is replaced with donor bone marrow.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for CLL varies depending on the stage and severity of the disease. In general, people with early-stage CLL may experience a good response to treatment and have a better outlook. However, those with advanced disease may face a poorer prognosis.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia\n* Acute Myeloid Leukemia\n* Childhood Leukemia\n* Chronic Myeloid Leukemia\n* Leukemia\n\n**National Institutes of Health**\n\nThe primary NIH organization for research on CLL is the National Cancer Institute.",

The phases are based on how much the CML has grown or spread:\n\n* **Phase 1:** The leukemia grows slowly, and there may be few symptoms.\n* **Phase 2:** The leukemia grows faster, and you may have more symptoms.\n* **Phase 3:** The leukemia grows very fast, and it can spread to other parts of your body.\n\nNote: This is a cleaned version of the provided medical content.\n\n---\n\n**Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia**\n\n**What is Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia?**\n\nChronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a type of chronic leukemia. \"Chronic\" means that the leukemia usually gets worse slowly.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe cause of CML is unknown. It is rare in children and usually occurs in adults during or after middle age. There are a few factors that could raise your risk:\n\n* Sometimes CML does not cause symptoms.\n* If you do have symptoms, they can include:\n\t+ Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose CML:\n\t+ Imaging tests to see whether the cancer has spread.\n\n**Phases of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia**\n\nCML has three phases. The phases are based on how much the CML has grown or spread:\n\n* **Chronic phase**, where less than 10% of cells in the blood and bone marrow are blast cells (leukemia cells). Most people are diagnosed in this phase, and many do not have symptoms.\n* **Accelerated phase**, 10% to 19% of the cells in the blood and bone marrow are blast cells. In this phase, people often have symptoms and standard treatment may not be as effective as in the chronic phase.\n* **Blastic phase**, where 20% or more of the cells in the blood or bone marrow are blast cells. The blast cells have spread to other tissues and organs.\n\n**Treatments for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia**\n\nThere are several different treatments for CML:\n\n* **Targeted therapy**, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells.\n* **Chemotherapy**\n* **Immunotherapy**\n* **High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant**\n* **Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI)**. DLI is a treatment that may be used after a stem cell transplant.\n* **Surgery to remove the spleen (splenectomy)**\n\n**Prevention and Risk Factors**\n\nIt is hard to predict who will get CML. There are a few factors that could raise your risk:\n\n* Sometimes CML does not cause symptoms.\n\n**Living With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia**\n\nWhen the signs and symptoms of CML are reduced or have disappeared, it is called remission. The CML may come back after remission, and you may need more treatment.\n\n**Specifics**\n\nCML usually occurs in adults during or after middle age. It is rare in children. Most people with CML have a genetic change called the Philadelphia chromosome.\n\n---\n\n**Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia**\n\n**Living as a Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Survivor**\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, living with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) can be challenging, but many people are able to lead normal lives with proper treatment and management.\n\n**Atypical Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia**\n\nThe National Cancer Institute defines atypical CML as a rare subtype of CML that is characterized by a different genetic profile. This type of leukemia is often more aggressive than typical CML.\n\n**Genetics**\n\nChronic myeloid leukemia: MedlinePlus Genetics (National Library of Medicine)\n\nCML is caused by a genetic mutation in which a part of chromosome 9 breaks off and attaches to chromosome 22, creating the BCR-ABL fusion gene. This mutation leads to the production of an abnormal enzyme that promotes the growth of cancer cells.\n\n**Statistics and Research**\n\nCancer Statistics: Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (National Cancer Institute)\n\nAccording to the National Cancer Institute, CML accounts for about 1% of all leukemia cases in the United States. The incidence of CML is higher in men than in women, and it is most common among people over the age of 60.\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\nClinicalTrials.gov: Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive (National Institutes of Health)\n\nClinicalTrials.gov: Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative (National Institutes of Health)\n\nTypes of Treatment: Clinical Trials (Leukemia & Lymphoma Society)\n\nCML is typically treated with a combination of medications that target the BCR-ABL fusion gene.

It is an unpleasant feeling, such as a prick, tingle, sting, burn, or ache. Pain may be sharp or dull. You may feel pain in one area of your body or all over. Each person feels pain differently, even if the reason for the pain is the same.\n\nPain might be acute or chronic. The type of pain is based on how long and how often you have pain. Acute pain starts suddenly and goes away when the cause is treated or healed. This pain lets you know that you may be injured or have a problem you need to take care of. Chronic pain lasts longer than three months or the time in which you should have healed.\n\nIf you have chronic pain, it can occur most days or every day and may last for weeks, months, or even years. It can affect all aspects of daily life, including your mood and relationships. Treatment may not get rid of chronic pain, but it can help with your symptoms.\n\n**What Causes Chronic Pain?**\n\nSometimes, acute pain can become chronic pain. The original cause may have been an injury or infection, or you may have an ongoing cause of pain, such as arthritis or cancer. In some cases, there is no clear cause. Environmental factors and psychological factors such as mood and stress can make chronic pain worse.\n\n**What Are the Symptoms of Chronic Pain?**\n\nSince people feel pain in different ways, two people could have the same issue, but each may have different symptoms. Chronic pain can occur anywhere in your body and may cause other symptoms such as fatigue, mood changes, or difficulty sleeping. If you have depression or stress, it may make chronic pain worse.\n\n**Who Is More Likely to Get Chronic Pain?**\n\nMany older adults have chronic pain. Women also report having more chronic pain than men, and they are at a greater risk for many pain conditions. Some people have two or more chronic pain conditions.

    "content": "**Chronic Cholecystitis**\n\nChronic cholecystitis is a condition characterized by the swelling and irritation of the gallbladder that persists over time. The gallbladder, located under the liver, stores bile produced by the liver, which aids in the digestion of fats in the small intestine.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMost cases of chronic cholecystitis are caused by repeated attacks of acute (sudden) cholecystitis, typically resulting from gallstones in the gallbladder. These attacks lead to the thickening of the gallbladder walls and its shrinkage, impairing its ability to concentrate, store, and release bile.\n\nThe disease is more common among women than men and often occurs after the age of 40. Factors that increase the risk for gallstones include birth control pills and pregnancy.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nAcute cholecystitis can be a painful condition leading to chronic cholecystitis, but it's unclear whether chronic cholecystitis causes any symptoms. Symptoms of acute cholecystitis may include:\n\n* Sharp, cramping, or dull pain in the upper right or middle of the belly\n* Steady pain lasting about 30 minutes\n* Pain spreading to the back or below the right shoulder blade\n* Clay-colored stools\n* Fever\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Yellowing of skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTo diagnose chronic cholecystitis, healthcare providers may order:\n\n* Blood tests:\n\t+ Lipase to diagnose pancreas diseases\n\t+ Complete blood count (CBC)\n\t+ Liver function tests to evaluate liver performance\n* Tests revealing gallstones or inflammation in the gallbladder:\n\t+ Abdominal ultrasound\n\t+ Abdominal CT scan\n\t+ Gallbladder scan (HIDA scan)\n\t+ Oral cholecystogram (rarely done)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe most common treatment for chronic cholecystitis is surgery, specifically cholecystectomy, which involves removing the gallbladder. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often performed, using smaller surgical cuts and resulting in a faster recovery. Many patients can go home from the hospital on the same day as surgery or the next morning.\n\nIf surgery is not possible due to other health conditions, medication may be used to dissolve gallstones. However, this process can take 2 years or longer and may result in the return of stones after treatment.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nCholecystectomy is a common procedure with a low risk of complications.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Cancer of the gallbladder (rarely)\n* Jaundice\n* Pancreatitis\n* Worsening of the condition\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of cholecystitis.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThe condition is not always preventable, but eating less fatty foods may relieve symptoms in some individuals.

Many people are able to go home from the hospital on the same day as surgery or the next morning.\n\nOpen cholecystectomy requires a larger cut in the upper-right part of the abdomen.\n\nIf you are too ill to have surgery due to other diseases or conditions, the gallstones may be dissolved with medicine taken by mouth. However, this may take 2 years or longer to work and the stones may return after treatment.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nCholecystectomy is a common procedure with a low risk.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Cancer of the gallbladder (rarely)\n* Jaundice\n* Pancreatitis\n* Worsening of the condition\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of cholecystitis.\n\n---\n\n**Chronic Cholecystitis**\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of cholecystitis.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThe condition is not always preventable.

Immunodeficiencies are conditions in which the immune system is not able to protect the body from foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi.\n\n**Symptoms of Chronic Granulomatous Disease**\n\nIndividuals with CGD may have recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. People with this condition may also have areas of inflammation (granulomas) in various tissues that can result in damage to those tissues. The features of CGD usually first appear in childhood, although some individuals do not show symptoms until later in life.\n\n**Common Areas of Infection**\n\nPeople with CGD typically have at least one serious bacterial or fungal infection every 3 to 4 years. The lungs are the most frequent area of infection; pneumonia is a common feature of this condition. Individuals with CGD may develop a type of fungal pneumonia, called mulch pneumonitis, which causes fever and shortness of breath after exposure to decaying organic materials such as mulch, hay, or dead leaves.\n\n**Inflammation in Chronic Granulomatous Disease**\n\nInflammation can occur in many different areas of the body in people with CGD. Most commonly, granulomas occur in the gastrointestinal tract and the genitourinary tract. In many cases the intestinal wall is inflamed, causing a form of inflammatory bowel disease that varies in severity but can lead to stomach pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n**Rare Complications**\n\nRarely, people with CGD develop autoimmune disorders, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Repeated episodes of infection and inflammation reduce the life expectancy of individuals with CGD; however, with treatment, most affected individuals live into mid- to late adulthood.\n\n---\n\n**Chronic Granulomatous Disease**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is Chronic Granulomatous Disease?**\n\nChronic granulomatous disease is a disorder that causes the immune system to malfunction, resulting in a form of immunodeficiency.

The features of chronic granulomatous disease usually first appear in childhood, although some individuals do not show symptoms until later in life.\n\n---\n\n**Chronic Granulomatous Disease**\n\n**What is Chronic Granulomatous Disease?**\n\nChronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the immune system. It occurs when there is a problem with the enzyme complex called NADPH oxidase, which plays an essential role in the immune system.\n\n**Symptoms of CGD**\n\nPeople with CGD may experience symptoms such as:\n\n* Recurring infections, particularly of the skin and lungs\n* Inflammation of the digestive tract, leading to an inability to digest food\n* Vomiting after eating and weight loss\n* Inflammation in the genitourinary tract, including the kidneys and bladder\n* Lymphadenitis (inflammation of the lymph nodes) and osteomyelitis (inflammation of the bone marrow)\n* Rarely, autoimmune disorders\n\n**Causes of CGD**\n\nCGD is caused by mutations in one of five genes: CYBA, CYBB, NCF1, NCF2, or NCF4. These genes produce proteins that are parts of the enzyme complex called NADPH oxidase. Without these proteins, NADPH oxidase cannot assemble or function properly, leaving affected individuals vulnerable to many types of infection and excessive inflammation.\n\n**Types of CGD**\n\nThere are five types of CGD, distinguished by the gene involved:\n\n* CYBA\n* CYBB (designated as CYBB0 if no functional beta chain is produced)\n* NCF1\n* NCF2\n* NCF4\n\n**Frequency of CGD**\n\nCGD is estimated to occur in 1 in 200,000 to 250,000 people worldwide.\n\n**Treatment and Prognosis**\n\nWith treatment, most affected individuals with CGD can live into mid- to late adulthood. However, repeated episodes of infection and inflammation reduce the life expectancy of individuals with CGD.\n\n---\n\n**Chronic Granulomatous Disease**\n\n**Inheritance Patterns**\n\nWhen chronic granulomatous disease is caused by mutations in the CYBB gene, the condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The CYBB gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons. Rarely, females with one altered copy of the CYBB gene have mild symptoms of chronic granulomatous disease, such as an increased frequency of bacterial or fungal infections.\n\nWhen chronic granulomatous disease is caused by CYBA, NCF1, NCF2, or NCF4 gene mutations, the condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. Men and women are affected by autosomal recessive conditions equally.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease\n* CGD\n* Granulomatous disease, chronic\n* X-linked chronic granulomatous disease\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nGenetic Testing Information:\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Granulomatous disease, chronic, autosomal recessive, cytochrome b-positive, type 1\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Granulomatous disease, chronic, autosomal recessive, cytochrome b-positive, type 2\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Granulomatous disease, chronic, autosomal recessive, cytochrome b-positive, type 3\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Granulomatous disease, chronic, X-linked\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Granulomatous disease, chronic, autosomal recessive, cytochrome b-negative\n\nPatient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\nClinical Trials:\n\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\n* GRANULOMATOUS DISEASE, CHRONIC, X-LINKED; CGDX\n* GRANULOMATOUS DISEASE, CHRONIC, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, 4; CGD4\n* GRANULOMATOUS DISEASE, CHRONIC, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, 1; CGD1\n* GRANULOMATOUS DISEASE, CHRONIC, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, 2; CGD2\n* GRANULOMATOUS DISEASE, CHRONIC, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, 3; CGD3\n\n---\n\n**Chronic Granulomatous Disease**\n\n**What is Chronic Granulomatous Disease?**\n\nChronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the immune system. It is characterized by the inability of white blood cells, called neutrophils, to kill certain bacteria and fungi.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nCGD is caused by mutations in the genes that code for the subunits of the enzyme NADPH oxidase, which is responsible for producing superoxides that kill bacteria. The risk factors for CGD include a family history of the disorder.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of CGD can vary depending on the severity of the disease and the presence of any underlying infections. They may include:\n\n* Recurring bacterial or fungal infections\n* Inflammation of the skin, lungs, or other organs\n* Enlargement of the lymph nodes or spleen\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis of CGD is typically made through genetic testing, which can identify mutations in the NADPH oxidase genes. Other diagnostic tests may include:\n\n* Complete blood count (CBC) to check for abnormal white blood cell counts\n* Blood cultures to detect bacterial or fungal infections\n* Imaging studies, such as X-rays or CT scans, to evaluate organ involvement\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for CGD, but treatment can help manage the symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment may include:\n\n* Antibiotics or antifungal medications to treat underlying infections\n* Surgery to remove infected tissue or organs\n* Bone marrow transplantation in severe cases\n* Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider to monitor for signs of infection or other complications\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with CGD varies depending on the severity of the disease and the effectiveness of treatment. With proper management, many people with CGD can lead normal lives, but they may require ongoing medical care to prevent complications.\n\n**References**\n\n* Ben-Ari J, Wolach O, Gavrieli R, Wolach B.

    "content": "**Chronic Granulomatous Disease**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nChronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an inherited disorder in which certain immune system cells do not function properly. It is characterized by repeated and severe infections.\n\n**Causes**\n\nIn CGD, immune system cells called phagocytes are unable to kill some types of bacteria and fungi. This disorder leads to long-term (chronic) and repeated (recurrent) infections. The condition is often discovered very early in childhood. Milder forms may be diagnosed during the teenage years, or even in adulthood.\n\nRisk factors include a family history of recurrent or chronic infections.\n\n**About half of CGD cases are passed down through families as a sex-linked recessive trait.**\n\nThis means that boys are more likely to get the disorder than girls. The variant gene is carried on the X chromosome. Boys have 1 X chromosome and 1 Y chromosome. If a boy has an X chromosome with the variant gene, he may inherit this condition. Girls have 2 X chromosomes. If a girl has 1 X chromosome with the variant gene, the other X chromosome may have a working gene to make up for it. A girl must inherit the variant X gene from each parent in order to have the disease.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCGD can cause many types of skin infections that are hard to treat, including:\n\n* Blisters or sores on the face (impetigo)\n* Eczema\n* Growths filled with pus (abscesses)\n* Pus-filled lumps in the skin (boils)\n\nCGD can also cause:\n\n* Persistent diarrhea\n* Swollen lymph nodes in the neck\n* Lung infections, such as pneumonia or lung abscess\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will do an exam and may find:\n\n* Liver swelling\n* Spleen swelling\n* Swollen lymph nodes\n\nThere may be signs of a bone infection, which may affect many bones.\n\nTests that may be done include:\n\n* Bone scan\n* Chest x-ray\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Flow cytometry tests to help confirm the diagnosis\n* Genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis\n* Test of white blood cell function\n* Tissue biopsy\n\n**Treatment**\n\nAntibiotics are used to treat infections caused by this condition. Chronic use of antibiotics may prevent infections. A medicine called interferon-gamma may also help reduce the number of severe infections. Surgery may be needed to treat some abscesses.\n\nThe only cure for CGD is a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nLong-term antibiotic treatments may help reduce infections, but early death can occur from repeated lung infections.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nCGD may cause these complications:\n\n* Bone damage and infections\n* Chronic infections in the nose\n* Pneumonia that keeps coming back and is hard to cure\n* Lung damage\n* Skin damage\n* Swollen lymph nodes that stay swollen, occur often, or form abscesses that need surgery to drain them\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nIf you or your child has this condition and you suspect pneumonia or another infection, contact your provider right away.\n\nTell your provider if a lung, skin, or other infection does not respond to treatment.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nGenetic counseling is recommended if you are planning to have children and you have a family history of this disease. Advances in genetic screening and the increasing use of chorionic villus sampling (a test that may be done during a woman's 10th to 12th week of pregnancy) have made early detection of CGD possible.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCGD; Fatal granulomatosis of childhood; Chronic granulomatous disease of childhood; Progressive septic granulomatosis; Phagocyte deficiency - chronic granulomatous disease\n\n---\n\n**Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD)**\n\n**What is CGD?**\n\nChronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an inherited disorder in which certain immune system cells do not function properly.

Polyneuropathy means several nerves are involved. CIDP often affects both sides of the body.\n\nCIDP is caused by an abnormal immune response. CIDP occurs when the immune system attacks the myelin cover of the nerves. For this reason, CIDP is thought to be an autoimmune disease.\n\nHealth care providers also consider CIDP as the chronic form of Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n\nThe specific triggers of CIDP vary. In many cases, the cause cannot be identified.\n\nCIDP may occur with other conditions, such as:\n\n* Chronic hepatitis\n* Diabetes\n* Infection with the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni\n* HIV/AIDS\n* Immune system disorders due to cancer\n* Inflammatory bowel disease\n* Systemic lupus erythematosus\n* Cancer of the lymph system\n* Overactive thyroid\n* Side effects of medicines to treat cancer or HIV\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms include any of the following:\n\n* Problems walking due to weakness or lack of feeling in the feet\n* Trouble using the arms and hands or legs and feet due to weakness\n* Sensation changes, such as numbness or decreased sensation, pain, burning, tingling, or other abnormal sensations (usually affects the feet first, then the arms and hands)\n\nOther symptoms that can occur with CIDP include:\n\n* Abnormal or uncoordinated movement\n* Problems breathing\n* Fatigue\n* Hoarseness or changing voice or slurred speech\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms, focusing on the nervous system and muscles.\n\nTests that may be ordered include:\n\n* Electromyography (EMG) to check the muscles and the nerves that control the muscles\n* Nerve conduction tests to check how fast electrical signals move through a nerve\n* Nerve biopsy to remove a small piece of a nerve for examination\n* Spinal tap (lumbar puncture) to check the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord\n* Blood tests may be done to look for specific proteins that are causing the immune attack on the nerves\n* Lung function tests to check if breathing is affected\n\nDepending on the suspected cause of CIDP, other tests, such as x-rays, imaging scans, and blood tests, may be done.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe most aggressive treatment is only given if you have difficulty walking, breathing, or if symptoms don't allow you to care for yourself or work.\n\nTreatments may include:\n\n* Corticosteroids to help reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms\n* Other medicines that suppress the immune system (for some severe cases)\n* Plasmapheresis or plasma exchange to remove antibodies from the blood\n* Intravenous immune globulin (IVIg), which involves injecting antibodies into the bloodstream to reduce the effect of the antibodies that are causing the problem\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThe outcome varies. The disorder may continue long term, or you may have repeated episodes of symptoms. Complete recovery is possible, but permanent loss of nerve function is not uncommon.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications of CIDP include:\n\n* Pain\n* Permanent decrease or loss of sensation in areas of the body\n* Permanent weakness or paralysis in areas of the body\n* Repeated or unnoticed injury to an area of the body\n* Side effects of medicines used to treat the disorder\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have a loss of movement or sensation in any area of the body, especially if your symptoms get worse.\n\n---\n\n**Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nCIDP is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the nerves, causing them to become inflamed and leading to muscle weakness or paralysis.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Muscle weakness or paralysis\n* Numbness or tingling in the hands and feet\n* Pain in the back, arms, and legs\n* Difficulty walking or maintaining balance\n\n**Tests**\n\n* Electromyography (EMG) to measure nerve function\n* Nerve conduction studies (NCS) to test nerve speed and strength\n* Blood tests to check for certain antibodies\n* Imaging scans such as MRI or CT scans to rule out other conditions\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to reverse the attack on the nerves.

The main job of the kidneys is to remove wastes and excess water from the body.\n\n**Causes**\n\nDiabetes and high blood pressure are the 2 most common causes and account for most cases. Many other diseases and conditions can damage the kidneys, including:\n\n* Autoimmune disorders (such as systemic lupus erythematosus and scleroderma)\n* Birth defects of the kidneys (such as polycystic kidney disease)\n* Some toxic chemicals\n* Injury to the kidney\n* Kidney stones and infection\n* Problems with the arteries feeding the kidneys\n* Some medicines, such as antibiotics, and pain and cancer medicines\n* Backward flow of urine into the kidneys (reflux nephropathy)\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe early symptoms of CKD are the same as for many other illnesses. These symptoms may be the only sign of a problem in the early stages.\n\n* Appetite loss\n* General ill feeling and fatigue\n* Headaches\n* Itching (pruritus) and dry skin\n* Nausea\n* Weight loss without trying to lose weight\n\nSymptoms that may occur when kidney function has gotten worse include:\n\n* Abnormally dark or light skin\n* Bone pain\n* Drowsiness or problems concentrating or thinking\n* Numbness in the hands and feet\n* Muscle twitching or cramps\n* Breath odor\n* Easy bruising, or blood in the stool\n* Excessive thirst\n* Frequent hiccups\n* Problems with sexual function\n* Menstrual periods stop (amenorrhea)\n* Shortness of breath\n* Sleep problems\n* Swelling in the hands and feet\n* Vomiting\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nMost people will have high blood pressure at all stages of CKD. During an exam, your health care provider may also hear abnormal heart or lung sounds in your chest. You may have signs of nerve damage during a nervous system exam.\n\nA urinalysis may show protein or other changes in your urine. These changes may appear months to years before symptoms appear.\n\nTests that check how well the kidneys are working include:\n\n* Creatinine clearance\n* Creatinine levels\n* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)\n\nCKD changes the results of several other tests. You may need to have the following blood tests as often as every 2 to 3 months when kidney disease gets worse:\n\n* Albumin\n* Calcium\n* Cholesterol\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Electrolytes\n* Magnesium\n* Phosphorous\n* Potassium\n* Sodium\n\nOther tests that may be done to look for the cause or type of kidney disease include:\n\n* CT scan of the abdomen\n* MRI of the abdomen\n* Ultrasound of the abdomen\n* Kidney biopsy\n* Kidney scan\n* Kidney ultrasound\n* Urine protein\n\n**Treatment**\n\nBlood pressure control will slow further kidney damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are used most often.\n\nMaking lifestyle changes can help protect the kidneys, and prevent heart disease and stroke, such as:\n\n* DO NOT smoke.\n* Eat meals that are low in fat and cholesterol.\n* Get regular exercise (talk to your provider or nurse before starting to exercise).\n* Take medicines to lower your cholesterol, if needed.\n* Keep your blood sugar under control.\n* Avoid eating too much salt or potassium.\n\nAlways talk to your provider before taking any over-the-counter medicine. This includes vitamins, herbs and supplements. Make sure all of the providers you visit know you have CKD. Other treatments may include:\n\n* Medicines called phosphate binders, to help prevent high phosphorous levels\n* Extra iron in the diet, iron pills, iron given through a vein (intravenous iron) special shots of a medicine called erythropoietin, and blood transfusions to treat anemia\n* Extra calcium and vitamin D (always talk to your provider before taking)\n\nYour provider may have you follow a special diet for CKD.\n\nLimiting fluids\nEating less protein\nRestricting phosphorous and other electrolytes\nGetting enough calories to prevent weight loss\n\nAll people with CKD should be up-to-date on the following vaccinations:\n\n* Hepatitis A vaccine\n* Hepatitis B vaccine\n* Flu vaccine\n* Pneumococcal vaccine (also called \"pneumonia vaccine\")\n* COVID-19\n\n---\n\n**Chronic Kidney Disease**\n\n**What is Chronic Kidney Disease?**\n\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is the slow loss of kidney function over time.

You may not notice any symptoms for some time. The loss of function may be so slow that you do not have symptoms until your kidneys have almost stopped working.\n\nThe final stage of CKD is called end-stage renal disease (ESRD). At this stage, the kidneys are no longer able to remove enough wastes and excess fluids from the body. At this point, you would need dialysis or a kidney transplant.\n\nDiabetes and high blood pressure are the 2 most common causes and account for most cases.\n\nMany other diseases and conditions can damage the kidneys, including:\n\n* Autoimmune disorders (such as systemic lupus erythematosus and scleroderma)\n* Birth defects of the kidneys (such as polycystic kidney disease)\n* Some toxic chemicals\n* Injury to the kidney\n* Kidney stones and infection\n* Problems with the arteries feeding the kidneys\n* Some medicines, such as antibiotics, and pain and cancer medicines\n* Backward flow of urine into the kidneys (reflux nephropathy)\n\nCKD leads to a buildup of fluid and waste products in the body. This condition affects most body systems and functions, including:\n\n* High blood pressure\n* Low blood cell count\n* Vitamin D and bone health\n\n\\n\\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe early symptoms of CKD are the same as for many other illnesses. These symptoms may be the only sign of a problem in the early stages.\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\n* Appetite loss\n* General ill feeling and fatigue\n* Headaches\n* Itching (pruritus) and dry skin\n* Nausea\n* Weight loss without trying to lose weight\n\nSymptoms that may occur when kidney function has gotten worse include:\n\n* Abnormally dark or light skin\n* Bone pain\n* Drowsiness or problems concentrating or thinking\n* Numbness in the hands and feet\n* Muscle twitching or cramps\n* Breath odor\n* Easy bruising, or blood in the stool\n* Excessive thirst\n* Frequent hiccups\n* Problems with sexual function\n* Menstrual periods stop (amenorrhea)\n* Shortness of breath\n* Sleep problems\n* Swelling in the hands and feet\n* Vomiting\n\n\\n\\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nMost people will have high blood pressure at all stages of CKD. During an exam, your health care provider may also hear abnormal heart or lung sounds in your chest. You may have signs of nerve damage during a nervous system exam.\n\nA urinalysis may show protein or other changes in your urine. These changes may appear months to years before symptoms appear.\n\nTests that check how well the kidneys are working include:\n\n* Creatinine clearance\n* Creatinine levels\n* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)\n\nCKD changes the results of several other tests. You may need to have the following blood tests as often as every 2 to 3 months when kidney disease gets worse:\n\n* Albumin\n* Calcium\n* Cholesterol\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Electrolytes\n* Magnesium\n* Phosphorous\n* Potassium\n* Sodium\n\nOther tests that may be done to look for the cause or type of kidney disease include:\n\n* CT scan of the abdomen\n* MRI of the abdomen\n* Ultrasound of the abdomen\n* Kidney biopsy\n* Kidney scan\n* Kidney ultrasound\n* Urine protein\n\n---\n\n**Chronic Kidney Disease**\n\n**Tests to Diagnose CKD**\n\n* CT scan of the abdomen\n* MRI of the abdomen\n* Ultrasound of the abdomen\n* Kidney biopsy\n* Kidney scan\n* Kidney ultrasound\n* Urine protein\n\nThis disease may also change the results of the following tests:\n\n* Erythropoietin\n* Parathyroid hormone (PTH)\n* Bone density test\n* Vitamin D level\n\n**Symptoms and Signs**\n\nA urinalysis may show protein or other changes in your urine.

During an exam, your health care provider may also hear abnormal heart or lung sounds in your chest.\n\n**Tests to Check Kidney Function**\n\nTests that check how well the kidneys are working include:\n\n* CKD changes the results of several other tests. You may need to have the following blood tests as often as every 2 to 3 months when kidney disease gets worse:\n* Other tests that may be done to look for the cause or type of kidney disease include:\n\n**Treatment**\n\nBlood pressure control will slow further kidney damage.\n\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are used most often.\nThe goal is to keep blood pressure at or below 130/80 mm Hg.\n\nMaking lifestyle changes can help protect the kidneys, and prevent heart disease and stroke, such as:\n\n* DO NOT smoke.\n* Eat meals that are low in fat and cholesterol.\n* Get regular exercise (talk to your provider or nurse before starting to exercise).\n* Take medicines to lower your cholesterol, if needed.\n* Keep your blood sugar under control.\n* Avoid eating too much salt or potassium.\n\nAlways talk to your provider before taking any over-the-counter medicine. This includes vitamins, herbs and supplements. Make sure all of the providers you visit know you have CKD. Other treatments may include:\n\n* Medicines called phosphate binders, to help prevent high phosphorous levels\n* Extra iron in the diet, iron pills, iron given through a vein (intravenous iron) special shots of a medicine called erythropoietin, and blood transfusions to treat anemia\n* Extra calcium and vitamin D (always talk to your provider before taking)\n\nYour provider may have you follow a special diet for CKD.\n\nLimiting fluids\nEating less protein\nRestricting phosphorous and other electrolytes\nGetting enough calories to prevent weight loss\n\nAll people with CKD should be up-to-date on the following vaccinations:\n\n* Hepatitis A vaccine\n* Hepatitis B vaccine\n* Flu vaccine\n* Pneumococcal vaccine (also called \"pneumonia vaccine\")\n* COVID-19\n\n---\n\n**Chronic Kidney Disease**\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Anemia\n* Bleeding from the stomach or intestines\n* Bone, joint, and muscle pain\n* Changes in blood sugar\n* Damage to nerves of the legs and arms (peripheral neuropathy)\n* Dementia\n* Fluid buildup around the lungs (pleural effusion)\n* Heart and blood vessel complications\n* High blood phosphorous levels\n* High blood potassium levels\n* Hyperparathyroidism\n* Increased risk of infections\n* Liver damage or failure\n* Malnutrition\n* Miscarriages and infertility\n* Seizures\n* Swelling (edema)\n* Weakening of the bones and increased risk of fractures\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTreating the condition that is causing the problem may help prevent or delay CKD. People who have diabetes should control their blood sugar and blood pressure levels and should not smoke.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nKidney failure - chronic; Renal failure - chronic; Chronic renal insufficiency; Chronic kidney failure; Chronic renal failure\n\n**Images**\n\n* Kidney anatomy\n* Kidney - blood and urine flow\n* Glomerulus and nephron\n\n**References**\n\nChristov M, Sprague SM.

These cells are found in the bone marrow and other parts of the body.\n\n**Causes of CLL**\n\nThe cause of CLL is unknown. There is no link to radiation exposure. It is unclear if certain chemicals can cause CLL. Exposure to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War has been linked to a slight increased risk for developing CLL.\n\nCLL usually affects older adults, especially those over age 60. People under age 45 rarely develop CLL. CLL is more common in white people than in people of other races. It is more common in men than in women. Some people with CLL have family members with the disease.\n\n**Symptoms of CLL**\n\nSymptoms usually develop slowly. CLL often does not cause symptoms at first. It may be found by blood tests done in people for other reasons.\n\nSymptoms of CLL may include:\n\n* Enlarged lymph nodes, liver, or spleen\n* Excessive sweating, night sweats\n* Fatigue\n* Fever\n* Infections that keep coming back (recur), despite treatment\n* Loss of appetite or becoming full too quickly (early satiety)\n* Weight loss\n\n**Diagnosing CLL**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.\n\nTests to diagnose CLL may include:\n\n* Complete blood count (CBC) with blood cell differential.\n* Flow cytometry test of the white blood cells.\n* Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is used to look at and count genes or chromosomes. This test may help diagnose CLL or guide treatment.\n* Testing for other gene changes may help predict how well the cancer will respond to treatment.\n\nPeople with CLL usually have a high white blood cell count.\n\n**Treatment of CLL**\n\nIf you have early stage CLL, your provider will just monitor you closely. Treatment is not generally given for early-stage CLL, unless you have:\n\n* Infections that keep coming back\n* Leukemia that is rapidly getting worse\n* Low red blood cell or platelet counts\n* Fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, or night sweats\n* Swollen lymph nodes\n\nTargeted therapy and sometimes chemotherapy are used to treat CLL. Your provider will determine which type of medicines are right for you.\n\nBlood transfusions or platelet transfusions may be required if blood counts are low.\n\nBone marrow or stem cell transplantation may be used in younger people with advanced or high-risk CLL. A transplant is the only therapy that offers a potential cure for CLL, but it also has risks. Your provider will discuss the risks and benefits with you.\n\n**Managing Side Effects**\n\nYou and your provider may need to manage other concerns during your leukemia treatment, including:\n\n* Managing your pets during chemotherapy\n* Bleeding problems\n* Dry mouth\n* Eating enough calories\n* Safe eating during cancer treatment\n* Support Groups\n\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nYour provider can discuss with you the outlook of your CLL based on its stage and how well it responds to treatment.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications of CLL and its treatment may include:\n\n* Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed by the immune system.\n* Bleeding from low platelet count.\n* Hypogammaglobulinemia, a condition in which there is a lower level of antibodies than normal, which can increase the risk of infection.\n* Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), a bleeding disorder.\n* Infections that keep coming back (recur).\n* Fatigue that can range from mild to severe.\n* Other cancers, including a much more aggressive lymphoma (Richter transformation).\n* Side effects of targeted therapy and chemotherapy.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you develop enlarged lymph nodes or unexplained fatigue, bruising, excessive sweating, or weight loss.\n\n---\n\n**Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)**\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\n*   Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.\n*   Tests to diagnose CLL may include:\n    *   Complete blood count (CBC) with blood cell differential.\n    *   Flow cytometry test of the white blood cells.\n    *   Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is used to look at and count genes or chromosomes.

If you cannot tell whether you or your child's movements are a tic or something more serious (such as a seizure), contact your provider.\n\n---\n\n**Chronic Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nChronic motor or vocal tic disorder is a condition where people experience repetitive movements or sounds that have no reason or goal. It's more common than Tourette syndrome, and chronic tics may be forms of Tourette syndrome.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of chronic motor or vocal tic disorder is unknown, but it's believed to involve abnormalities in the brain's motor control systems.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nA tic is a sudden, fast, repeated movement or sound that has no reason or goal. Tics can involve:\n\n* Excessive blinking\n* Grimaces of the face\n* Quick movements of the arms, legs, or other areas\n* Sounds (grunts, throat clearing, contractions of the abdomen or diaphragm)\n\nSome people have many kinds of tics.\n\nPeople with the condition can hold off these symptoms for a short time.

The disorder is named after French physician Etienne-Louis Ariste Bouée's patient, Tourette, who exhibited these symptoms in the 18th century.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Chronic Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder**\n\nThe exact causes of chronic motor or vocal tic disorder are still not fully understood, but research suggests that it may be related to abnormalities in certain brain regions and systems. Some studies have found that individuals with Tourette syndrome tend to have differences in the structure and function of their basal ganglia, a group of structures involved in movement control.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms of Chronic Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder**\n\nThe symptoms of chronic motor or vocal tic disorder can vary widely from person to person. Some common symptoms include:\n\n*   Tics: repetitive, stereotyped movements such as eye blinking, facial twitching, or head jerking\n*   Vocal tics: involuntary sounds such as throat clearing, coughing, or grunting\n*   Motor tics: involuntary movements such as arm or leg jerking, or body posturing\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment of Chronic Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder**\n\nWhile there is no cure for chronic motor or vocal tic disorder, various treatments can help manage the symptoms. These may include:\n\n*   Medications: to reduce the severity and frequency of tics\n*   Behavioral therapies: such as habit reversal training or exposure therapy\n*   Lifestyle modifications: such as stress management, exercise, and a balanced diet\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis of Chronic Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with chronic motor or vocal tic disorder varies widely depending on the severity of symptoms and the effectiveness of treatment. With proper management, many people with Tourette syndrome can lead normal lives, while others may experience more significant challenges.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n*   Singer HS, Mink JW, Gilbert DL, Jankovic J.

    "content": "**Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)**\n\n_Cancer that starts inside the bone marrow_\n\nCML causes an uncontrolled growth of immature and mature cells that make a certain type of white blood cell called myeloid cells. The diseased cells build up in the bone marrow and blood.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Related to an abnormal chromosome called the Philadelphia chromosome\n*   Radiation exposure can increase the risk of developing CML\n*   Most people with CML have not been exposed to radiation\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nChronic myelogenous leukemia is grouped into phases:\n\n*   **Chronic**: The chronic phase can last for months or years. The disease may have few or no symptoms during this time.\n*   **Accelerated**: Leukemia cells grow more quickly. Common symptoms include fever (even without infection), bone pain, and a swollen spleen.\n*   **Blast Crisis**: Bleeding and infection may occur due to bone marrow failure.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\n*   A physical examination often reveals a swollen spleen\n*   A complete blood count (CBC) shows an increased number of white blood cells with many immature forms present and an increased number of platelets\n*   Other tests that may be done include:\n    *   Bone marrow biopsy\n    *   Blood and bone marrow testing for the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome\n\n**Treatment**\n\nMedicines that target the abnormal protein made by the Philadelphia chromosome are often the first treatment for CML. These medicines can be taken as pills. People treated with these drugs often go into remission quickly and can stay in remission for many years.\n\nSometimes, chemotherapy is used first to reduce the white blood cell count if it is very high at diagnosis.\n\n---\n\n**Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)**\n\n**What is CML?**\n\nCML is cancer that starts inside the bone marrow, which is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells.\n\n**Causes of CML**\n\nThe cause of CML is related to an abnormal chromosome called the Philadelphia chromosome. Radiation exposure can increase the risk of developing CML, but it takes many years to develop leukemia from radiation exposure. Most people treated for cancer with radiation do not develop leukemia, and most people with CML have not been exposed to radiation.\n\n**Symptoms of CML**\n\nCML is grouped into phases:\n\n* **Chronic phase**: The disease may have few or no symptoms during this time.\n* **Accelerated phase**: Leukemia cells grow more quickly. Common symptoms include fever (even without infection), bone pain, and a swollen spleen.\n* **Blast crisis phase**: Bleeding and infection may occur due to bone marrow failure.\n\nOther possible symptoms of a blast crisis include:\n\n* Bruising\n* Excessive sweating (night sweats)\n* Fatigue\n* Fever\n* Pressure under the lower left ribs from a swollen spleen\n* Rash -- small pinpoint red marks on the skin (petechiae)\n* Weakness\n\n**Diagnosing CML**\n\nA physical examination often reveals a swollen spleen.

    "content": "**Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**\n\n_COPD is a common lung disease that makes it hard to breathe._\n\nThere are two main forms of COPD:\n\n*   **Chronic Bronchitis**: A long-term cough with mucus\n*   **Emphysema**: Damage to the lungs over time\n\nMost people with COPD have a combination of both conditions.\n\n**Causes**\n\nSmoking is the main cause of COPD. The more a person smokes, the more likely that person will develop COPD. But some people smoke for years and never get COPD.\n\nIf a person has a rare condition in which they lack a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin, they can develop emphysema even without smoking.\n\nOther risk factors for COPD are:\n\n*   Exposure to certain gases or fumes in the workplace\n*   Exposure to heavy amounts of secondhand smoke and pollution\n*   Frequent use of a cooking fire without proper ventilation\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\n\n*   Cough, with or without mucus\n*   Fatigue\n*   Frequent respiratory infections\n*   Shortness of breath (dyspnea) that gets worse with mild activity\n*   Trouble catching one's breath\n*   Wheezing\n\nBecause the symptoms develop slowly, many people may not know that they have COPD.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nThe best test for COPD is a lung function test called spirometry. This involves blowing out as hard as possible into a small machine that tests air movement and lung capacity. The results can be checked right away.\n\nUsing a stethoscope to listen to the lungs can also be helpful, showing prolonged expiratory time or wheezing. But sometimes, the lungs sound normal, even when a person has COPD.\n\nImaging tests of the lungs, such as x-rays and CT scans may be ordered. With an x-ray, the lungs may look normal, even when a person has COPD. A CT scan will almost always show signs of COPD if it is present.\n\nSometimes, a blood test called arterial blood gas may be done to measure the amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood.\n\nIf your health care provider suspects you have alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a blood test will likely be ordered to detect this condition.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for COPD. But there are many things you can do to relieve symptoms and keep the disease from getting worse.\n\nIf you smoke, now is the time to quit. This is the best way to slow lung damage.\n\nMedicines used to treat COPD include:\n\n*   Quick-relief drugs to help open the airways\n*   Control drugs to reduce lung inflammation\n*   Anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce swelling in the airways\n*   Certain long-term antibiotics\n\nIn severe cases or during flare-ups, you may need to receive:\n\n*   Steroids by mouth or through a vein (intravenously)\n*   Bronchodilators through a nebulizer\n*   Oxygen therapy\n*   Assistance from a machine to help breathing by using a mask or through the use of an endotracheal tube\n\nYour provider may prescribe antibiotics during symptom flare-ups, because an infection can make COPD worse.\n\nYou may need oxygen therapy at home if you have a low level of oxygen in your blood.\n\nPulmonary rehabilitation does not cure COPD. But it can teach you more about the disease, train you to breathe in a different way so you can stay active and feel better, and keep you functioning at the highest level possible.\n\n**LIVING WITH COPD**\n\nYou can do things every day to keep COPD from getting worse, protect your lungs, and stay healthy.\n\nWalk to build up strength:\n\n*   Ask the provider or respiratory therapist how far to walk.\n*   Slowly increase how far you walk.\n*   Avoid talking if you get short of breath when you walk.\n*   Use pursed lip breathing when you breathe out, to empty your lungs before the next breath.\n\nThings you can do to make it easier for yourself around the home include:\n\n*   Avoid very cold air or very hot weather\n*   Make sure no one smokes in your home\n*   Reduce air pollution by not using the fireplace and getting rid of other irritants\n*   Manage stress and your mood\n*   Use oxygen if prescribed for you\n\nEat healthy foods, including fish, poultry, and lean meat, as well as fruits and vegetables. If it is hard to keep your weight up, talk to a provider or dietitian about eating foods with more calories, by eating small frequent meals.\n\n**Surgery or Other Interventions**\n\nOnly a few people benefit from these surgical treatments:\n\n*   One-way valves can be inserted with a bronchoscopy to help deflate parts of the lung that are hyperinflated (overinflated) in select patients.\n*   Surgery to remove parts of the diseased lung, which can help less-diseased parts work better in some people with emphysema (lung volume reduction surgery).\n*   Lung transplant for a small number of very severe cases.\n\n**Support Groups**\n\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nCOPD is a long-term (chronic) illness. The disease will get worse more quickly if you do not stop smoking.\n\nIf you have severe COPD, you will be short of breath with most activities. You may be admitted to the hospital more often.\n\nTalk with your provider about breathing machines and end-of-life care as the disease progresses.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nWith COPD, you may have other health problems such as:\n\n*   Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)\n*   Need for breathing machine support with a mask (non-invasive ventilation) and oxygen therapy\n*   Right-sided heart failure or cor pulmonale (heart swelling and heart failure due to chronic lung disease)\n*   Pneumonia\n*   Collapsed lung (pneumothorax)\n*   Severe weight loss and malnutrition\n*   Thinning of the bones (osteoporosis)\n*   Debilitation\n*   Increased anxiety\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nGo to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have a rapid increase in shortness of breath.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nNot smoking prevents most cases of COPD. Ask your provider about quit-smoking programs. Medicines are also available to help you stop smoking.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nCOPD; Chronic obstructive airways disease; Chronic obstructive lung disease; Chronic bronchitis; Emphysema; Bronchitis - chronic\n\n**References**\n\n*   Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) website.

It's also known as chronic bronchitis or emphysema.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nNot smoking is the best way to prevent most cases of COPD. If you do smoke, quitting can help reduce your risk of developing the disease. Other risk factors include:\n\n*   Smoking\n*   Exposure to pollutants like dust, chemicals, and tobacco smoke\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nCOPD symptoms can vary from person to person, but common ones include:\n\n*   Shortness of breath (dyspnea)\n*   Coughing up mucus or phlegm\n*   Wheezing or a high-pitched sound when breathing out\n*   Feeling tired or weak\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nYour doctor may use the following tests to diagnose COPD:\n\n*   Spirometry: measures how much air you can breathe in and out\n*   Chest X-ray: takes pictures of your lungs\n*   Blood tests: check for signs of inflammation or infection\n\n**Treatment**\n\nWhile there's no cure for COPD, treatment can help manage symptoms and slow disease progression. Your doctor may prescribe:\n\n*   Medications to open airways, reduce inflammation, or loosen mucus\n*   Oxygen therapy to help you breathe easier\n*   Pulmonary rehabilitation: a program that includes exercise, education, and support to help you manage your condition\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThe best way to prevent COPD is not to smoke. If you do smoke, quitting can significantly reduce your risk of developing the disease.\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\nHere are some tips for managing your COPD:\n\n*   Use a peak flow meter to track your lung function\n*   Make exercise a habit to improve your overall health\n*   Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water\n*   Get regular check-ups with your doctor\n\n**Images**\n\nSome images related to COPD include:\n\n*   Spirometry: measures how much air you can breathe in and out\n*   Emphysema: a type of COPD that damages the air sacs in your lungs\n*   Bronchitis: inflammation of the lining of your bronchial tubes\n*   Quitting smoking: the best way to prevent most cases of COPD\n\n**References**\n\nHere are some references for further reading:\n\n*   Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) website\n*   Han MK, Lazarus SC.

Your health care provider may have changed some of your COPD medicines during your hospital stay.\n\n**Keep Active**\n\nTo build strength:\n\n*   Walk until it is a little hard to breathe.\n*   Slowly increase how far you walk.\n*   Try not to talk when you walk.\n*   Ask your provider how far to walk.\n*   Ride a stationary bike. Ask your provider how long and how hard to ride.\n\nBuild your strength even when you are sitting.\n\n*   Use small weights or an exercise band to strengthen your arms and shoulders.\n*   Stand up and sit down several times.\n*   Hold your legs straight out in front of you, then put them down. Repeat this movement several times.\n\nAsk your provider whether you need to use oxygen during your activities, and if so, how much. You may be told to keep your oxygen above 90%. You can measure this with an oximeter. This is a small device that measures your body's oxygen level. Talk with your provider about how much oxygen is safe to use and what oxygen saturation to aim for.\n\nTalk to your provider about whether you should do an exercise and conditioning program such as pulmonary rehabilitation.\n\n**Self-care**\n\nKnow how and when to take your COPD medicines.\n\n*   Take your quick-relief inhaler when you feel short of breath and need help fast, but always according to your provider's instructions so you don't take too much.\n*   Take your long-term medicines every day.\n\nEat smaller meals more often, such as 6 smaller meals a day. It might be easier to breathe when your stomach is not full. Do not drink a lot of liquid before eating, or with your meals.\n\nAsk your provider what foods to eat to get more energy.\n\nKeep your lungs from becoming more damaged.\n\n*   If you smoke, now is the time to quit.\n*   Stay away from smokers when you are out, and do not allow smoking in your home.\n*   Stay away from strong odors and fumes.\n*   Do breathing exercises.\n\nTalk to your provider if you feel depressed or anxious.\n\n**Stay Away From Infections**\n\nHaving COPD makes it easier for you to get infections. Get a flu shot every year. Ask your provider if you should get a pneumococcal (pneumonia) vaccine, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, a Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis) vaccine, a Zoster vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nWash your hands often. Always wash after you go to the bathroom and when you are around people who are sick.\n\nStay away from crowds. Ask visitors who have colds to wear masks or to visit when they're all better.\n\n**Save Your Energy at Home**\n\nPlace items you use often in spots where you do not have to reach or bend over to get them.\n\nUse a cart with wheels to move things around the house and kitchen. Use an electric can opener, dishwasher, and other things that will make your chores easier to do. Use cooking tools (knives, peelers, and pans) that are not heavy.\n\nTo save energy:\n\n*   Use slow, steady motions when you are doing things.\n*   Sit down if you can when you are cooking, eating, dressing, and bathing.\n*   Minimize going up and down the stairs.\n*   Get help for harder tasks.\n*   Do not try to do too much in one day.\n*   Keep your phone with you or near you.\n*   After bathing, wrap yourself in a towel rather than drying off.\n*   Try to reduce stress in your life.\n\n**Going Home With Oxygen**\n\nNever change how much oxygen is flowing in your oxygen setup without asking your provider.\n\nAlways have a back-up supply of oxygen in the home or with you when you go out. Keep the phone number of your oxygen supplier with you at all times. Learn how to use oxygen safely at home.\n\n**Follow-up**\n\nYour hospital provider may ask you to make a follow-up visit with:\n\n*   Your primary care provider\n*   A respiratory therapist, who can teach you breathing exercises and how to use your oxygen\n*   Your lung doctor (pulmonologist)\n*   Someone who can help you stop smoking, if you smoke\n*   A physical therapist, if you join a pulmonary rehabilitation program\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your provider if your breathing is:\n\n*   Getting harder\n*   Faster than before\n*   Shallow, and you cannot get a deep breath\n\nAlso contact your provider if:\n\n*   You need to lean forward when sitting in order to breathe easily\n*   It is difficult to speak even a few words without being short of breath\n*   You are using muscles around your ribs to help you breathe\n*   You are having headaches more often\n*   You feel sleepy or confused\n*   You have a fever\n*   You are coughing up dark mucus\n*   Your fingertips or the skin around your fingernails are blue\n\n---\n\n**Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease - Adults - Discharge**\n\nYou were in the hospital to treat breathing problems that are caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD damages your lungs. This makes it hard to breathe and get enough oxygen.\n\n**After You Go Home**\n\nFollow instructions on taking care of yourself.

    "content": "**Chronic Pancreatitis**\n\n**What is Chronic Pancreatitis?**\n\nChronic pancreatitis is a condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed and scarred, leading to permanent damage. It is characterized by recurring episodes of acute pancreatitis that do not heal or improve over time.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe pancreas produces chemicals (enzymes) needed to digest food and hormones such as insulin and glucagon. When scarring occurs, the organ can no longer produce the right amount of these enzymes, leading to digestive problems.\n\nDamage to the parts of the pancreas that make insulin may lead to diabetes mellitus.\n\nThe condition is most often caused by:\n\n*   **Alcohol abuse**: Over many years, excessive drinking can cause chronic pancreatitis.\n*   **Repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis**: If left untreated or poorly managed, acute pancreatitis can lead to chronic pancreatitis.\n*   **Genetics**: In some cases, genetics may play a role in the development of chronic pancreatitis.\n*   **Unknown causes**: Sometimes, the underlying cause of chronic pancreatitis is not known.\n*   **Gallstones**: Gallstones can also contribute to the development of chronic pancreatitis.\n\nOther conditions that have been linked to chronic pancreatitis include:\n\n*   **Problems with the immune system**\n*   **Blockage of the tubes (ducts) that drain enzymes from the pancreas**\n*   **Cystic fibrosis**\n*   **High levels of a fat called triglycerides in the blood**\n*   **Overactive parathyroid gland**\n*   **Use of certain medicines**\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nChronic pancreatitis can cause a range of symptoms, including:\n\n*   **Abdominal pain**: This is often the most common symptom and can be severe.\n*   **Digestive problems**: These may include chronic weight loss, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, foul-smelling stools, and pale or orange-colored stools.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTo diagnose pancreatitis, your healthcare provider may perform the following tests:\n\n*   **Fecal fat test**\n*   **Increased serum amylase level**\n*   **Increased serum lipase level**\n*   **Serum trypsinogen**\n\nTests that may show the cause of pancreatitis include:\n\n*   **Serum IgG4** (for diagnosing autoimmune pancreatitis)\n*   **Gene testing**, most often done when other common causes are not present or there is a family history\n\nImaging tests that can show swelling, scarring, calcifications, or other changes in the pancreas may include:\n\n*   **CT scan of the abdomen**\n*   **Ultrasound of the abdomen**\n*   **Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)**\n*   **Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)**\n*   **Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)**\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for chronic pancreatitis depends on the severity of symptoms and may include:\n\n*   **Pain medicines**\n*   **Fluids given through a vein (IV)**\n*   **Stopping food or fluid by mouth to limit the activity of the pancreas, and then slowly starting an oral diet**\n*   **Inserting a tube through the nose or mouth to remove the contents of the stomach (nasogastric suctioning)**\n\nA healthy diet is essential for people with chronic pancreatitis. This may include:\n\n*   **Drinking plenty of liquids**\n*   **Limiting fats**\n*   **Eating small, frequent meals** (this helps reduce digestive symptoms)\n*   **Getting enough vitamins and calcium in the diet, or as extra supplements**\n\nYour healthcare provider may prescribe pancreatic enzymes to help you digest food better, gain weight, and reduce diarrhea.\n\nAvoiding smoking and drinking alcoholic beverages is crucial, even if your pancreatitis is mild. This helps decrease your risk of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.\n\nOther treatments may involve:\n\n*   **Pain medicines or a surgical nerve block** to relieve pain\n*   **Taking insulin** to control blood sugar (glucose) level\n\nIn severe cases, surgery may be performed if a blockage is found. In some instances, a part of or the entire pancreas may be removed.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThis is a serious disease that may lead to disability and death. You can reduce the risk by avoiding alcohol.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n*   **Ascites** (build up of fluid in the abdomen)\n*   **Blockage** (obstruction) of the small intestine or bile ducts\n*   **Blood clot in the vein of the spleen**\n*   **Fluid collections in the pancreas** (pancreatic pseudocysts) that may become infected (pancreatic abscess)\n*   **Diabetes**\n*   **Poor absorption of fat, nutrients, and vitamins** (most often the fat-soluble vitamins, A, D, E, or K)\n*   **Iron deficiency anemia**\n*   **Vitamin B12 deficiency**\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n*   You develop symptoms of pancreatitis\n*   You have pancreatitis, and your symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment\n\n**Prevention**\n\nFinding the cause of acute pancreatitis and treating it quickly may help prevent chronic pancreatitis. Limiting alcohol consumption can also reduce the risk of developing this condition.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nChronic pancreatitis - chronic; Pancreatitis - chronic - discharge; Pancreatic insufficiency - chronic; Acute pancreatitis - chronic\n\n---\n\n**Chronic Pancreatitis**\n\n**What is Chronic Pancreatitis?**\n\nPancreatitis is swelling of the pancreas. Chronic pancreatitis is present when this problem does not heal or recurs and does not improve, gets worse over time, and leads to permanent damage.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach. It produces chemicals (called enzymes) needed to digest food. It also produces the hormones insulin and glucagon.\n\nWhen scarring of the pancreas occurs, the organ is no longer able to make the right amount of these enzymes. As a result, your body may be unable to digest fat and key elements of food.\n\nDamage to the parts of the pancreas that make insulin may lead to diabetes mellitus.\n\nThe condition is most often caused by alcohol abuse over many years. Repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis can lead to chronic pancreatitis. Genetics may be a factor in some cases. Sometimes, the cause is not known or caused by gall stones.\n\nOther conditions that have been linked to chronic pancreatitis:\n\n* Problems when the immune system attacks the body\n* Blockage of the tubes (ducts) that drain enzymes from the pancreas\n* Cystic fibrosis\n* High levels of a fat, called triglycerides, in the blood\n* Overactive parathyroid gland\n* Use of certain medicines (especially sulfonamides, thiazides, and azathioprine)\n* Pancreatitis that is passed down in families (hereditary)\n\nChronic pancreatitis is more common in men than in women. This often occurs in people ages 30 to 40.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms include:\n\n* ABDOMINAL PAIN\n\t+ Greatest in the upper abdomen\n\t+ May last from hours to days; over time, may always be present\n\t+ May get worse from eating\n\t+ May get worse from drinking alcohol\n\t+ May also be felt in the back as if it is boring through the abdomen\n* DIGESTIVE PROBLEMS\n\t+ Chronic weight loss, even when eating habits and amounts are normal.\n\t+ Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.\n\t+ Foul-smelling fatty or oily stools.\n\t+ Pale or orange-colored stools.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests to diagnose pancreatitis include:\n\n* Fecal fat test\n* Increased serum amylase level\n* Increased serum lipase level\n* Serum trypsinogen\n\nTests that may show the cause of pancreatitis include:\n\n* Serum IgG4 (for diagnosing autoimmune pancreatitis)\n* Gene testing, most often done when other common causes are not present or there is a family history\n\nImaging tests that can show swelling, scarring, calcifications or other changes of the pancreas may be seen on:\n\n* CT scan of the abdomen\n* Ultrasound of the abdomen\n* Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)\n* Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)\n* Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nPeople with severe pain or who are losing weight may need to stay in the hospital for:\n\n* Pain medicines.\n* Fluids given through a vein (IV).\n* Stopping food or fluid by mouth to limit the activity of the pancreas, and then slowly starting an oral diet. Feeding the intestine is an important part of treating pancreatitis. If you can’t eat by mouth, a temporary feeding tube may be placed to give your intestine nutrients.\n* Inserting a tube through the nose or mouth to remove the contents of the stomach (nasogastric suctioning) may sometimes be done. The tube may stay in for 1 to 2 days, or sometimes for 1 to 2 weeks.\n\nThe right diet is important for people with chronic pancreatitis to keep a healthy weight and get the correct nutrients. A nutritionist can help you create a diet that includes:\n\n* Drinking plenty of liquids\n* Limiting fats\n* Eating small, frequent meals (this helps reduce digestive symptoms)\n* Getting enough vitamins and calcium in the diet, or as extra supplements\n* Limiting caffeine\n\nThe health care provider may prescribe pancreatic enzymes. You must take these medicines with every meal, and even with snacks. The enzymes will help you digest food better, gain weight and reduce diarrhea.\n\nAvoiding smoking and drinking alcoholic beverages is very important, even if your pancreatitis is mild. This helps decrease your risk of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.\n\nOther treatments may involve:\n\n* Pain medicines or a surgical nerve block to relieve pain\n* Taking insulin to control blood sugar (glucose) level\n\nSurgery may be performed if a blockage is found. In severe cases, a part of or the entire pancreas may be removed.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nThis is a serious disease that may lead to disability and death.

Sometimes, the cause is not known or caused by gall stones.\n\nOther conditions that have been linked to chronic pancreatitis:\n\n* Problems when the immune system attacks the body\n* Blockage of the tubes (ducts) that drain enzymes from the pancreas\n* Cystic fibrosis\n* High levels of a fat, called triglycerides, in the blood\n* Overactive parathyroid gland\n* Use of certain medicines (especially sulfonamides, thiazides, and azathioprine)\n* Pancreatitis that is passed down in families (hereditary)\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nABDOMINAL PAIN\n\n* Greatest in the upper abdomen\n* May last from hours to days; over time, may always be present\n* May get worse from eating\n* May get worse from drinking alcohol\n* May also be felt in the back as if it is boring through the abdomen\n\nDIGESTIVE PROBLEMS\n\n* Chronic weight loss, even when eating habits and amounts are normal.\n* Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.\n* Foul-smelling fatty or oily stools.\n* Pale or orange-colored stools.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nTests to diagnose pancreatitis include:\n\n* Fecal fat test\n* Increased serum amylase level\n* Increased serum lipase level\n* Serum trypsinogen\n\nTests that may show the cause of pancreatitis include:\n\n* Serum IgG4 (for diagnosing autoimmune pancreatitis)\n* Gene testing, most often done when other common causes are not present or there is a family history\n\nImaging tests that can show swelling, scarring, calcifications or other changes of the pancreas may be seen on:\n\n* CT scan of the abdomen\n* Ultrasound of the abdomen\n* Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)\n* Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)\n* Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nPeople with severe pain or who are losing weight may need to stay in the hospital for:\n\n* Pain medicines.\n* Fluids given through a vein (IV).\n* Stopping food or fluid by mouth to limit the activity of the pancreas, and then slowly starting an oral diet. Feeding the intestine is an important part of treating pancreatitis. If you can’t eat by mouth, a temporary feeding tube may be placed to give your intestine nutrients.\n* Inserting a tube through the nose or mouth to remove the contents of the stomach (nasogastric suctioning) may sometimes be done. The tube may stay in for 1 to 2 days, or sometimes for 1 to 2 weeks.\n\nThe right diet is important for people with chronic pancreatitis to keep a healthy weight and get the correct nutrients. A nutritionist can help you create a diet that includes:\n\n* Drinking plenty of liquids\n* Limiting fats\n* Eating small, frequent meals (this helps reduce digestive symptoms)\n* Getting enough vitamins and calcium in the diet, or as extra supplements\n* Limiting caffeine\n\nThe health care provider may prescribe pancreatic enzymes. You must take these medicines with every meal, and even with snacks. The enzymes will help you digest food better, gain weight and reduce diarrhea.\n\nAvoiding smoking and drinking alcoholic beverages is very important, even if your pancreatitis is mild. This helps decrease your risk of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.\n\nOther treatments may involve:\n\n* Pain medicines or a surgical nerve block to relieve pain\n* Taking insulin to control blood sugar (glucose) level\n\nSurgery may be performed if a blockage is found. In severe cases, a part of or the entire pancreas may be removed.\n\n---\n\n**Chronic Pancreatitis**\n\n**What is Chronic Pancreatitis?**\n\nChronic pancreatitis is a serious disease that may lead to disability and death. It is characterized by inflammation of the pancreas, which can cause pain, weight loss, and other complications.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of chronic pancreatitis is not known, but it is believed to be related to:\n\n*   **Genetics**: Some people may be born with a predisposition to develop chronic pancreatitis.\n*   **Alcohol abuse**: Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can damage the pancreas and increase the risk of developing chronic pancreatitis.\n*   **Other factors**: Certain medical conditions, such as cystic fibrosis or pancreatic cancer, can also increase the risk of developing chronic pancreatitis.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of chronic pancreatitis may include:\n\n*   **Abdominal pain**: Pain in the upper abdomen that may radiate to the back.\n*   **Weight loss**: Loss of appetite and weight due to poor digestion and absorption of nutrients.\n*   **Diarrhea**: Frequent bowel movements due to poor digestion and absorption of fats.\n*   **Fatigue**: Feeling tired or weak due to malnutrition.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThe diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis is typically made based on a combination of:\n\n*   **Medical history**: A review of the patient's medical history, including symptoms and previous treatments.\n*   **Physical examination**: A physical examination to check for signs of inflammation or other complications.\n*   **Imaging tests**: Imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs to visualize the pancreas and detect any blockages or abnormalities.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment of chronic pancreatitis may involve:\n\n*   **Pain management**: Medications or surgical nerve blocks to relieve pain.\n*   **Nutritional support**: A special diet that includes pancreatic enzymes to help with digestion and absorption of nutrients.\n*   **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove a blockage or repair any damage to the pancreas.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nFinding the cause of acute pancreatitis and treating it quickly may help prevent chronic pancreatitis. Limiting alcohol consumption can also reduce the risk of developing this condition.\n\n**Complications**\n\nChronic pancreatitis can lead to several complications, including:\n\n*   **Ascites**: A build-up of fluid in the abdomen.\n*   **Blockage**: An obstruction of the small intestine or bile ducts.\n*   **Blood clot**: A blood clot in the vein of the spleen.\n*   **Fluid collections**: Fluid collections in the pancreas that may become infected (pancreatic abscess).\n*   **Diabetes**: High blood sugar levels due to poor insulin production.\n*   **Poor absorption**: Poor absorption of fats, nutrients, and vitamins.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if:\n\n*   You develop symptoms of pancreatitis\n*   You have pancreatitis, and your symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment\n\nBy understanding the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, complications, and when to contact a medical professional, you can take steps to manage chronic pancreatitis and reduce its impact on your life.\n\n---\n\n**Chronic Pancreatitis**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Definition and Causes**\n\nChronic pancreatitis is a long-standing inflammation of the pancreas that can lead to its destruction. The exact cause of chronic pancreatitis is not fully understood, but it is believed to result from an interplay between genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and individual susceptibility.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nThe symptoms of chronic pancreatitis may include abdominal pain, weight loss, and steatorrhea (fatty stools). The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis can be made using a variety of tests, including imaging studies such as CT scans or MRI, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and laboratory tests to measure pancreatic enzymes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThe treatment of chronic pancreatitis depends on the severity of the disease and may include medications to manage pain and inflammation, dietary changes to reduce fat intake, and in some cases, surgery to remove a portion of the pancreas. In severe cases, a pancreas transplant may be necessary.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\nIf you have been diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, it is essential to work closely with your healthcare provider to manage your symptoms and prevent complications. This may include:\n\n*   Following a low-fat diet to reduce strain on the pancreas\n*   Taking medications as directed by your healthcare provider to manage pain and inflammation\n*   Attending regular follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider to monitor your condition and adjust treatment as needed\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\nChronic pancreatitis is often associated with other health conditions, including:\n\n*   Pancreatitis\n*   Digestive system disorders",

    "content": "**Chylomicron Retention Disease**\n\nChylomicron retention disease is an inherited disorder that impairs the normal absorption of fats, cholesterol, and certain vitamins from food. The features of chylomicron retention disease primarily affect the gastrointestinal system and nervous system.\n\n**Description**\n\nChylomicron retention disease begins in infancy or early childhood. Affected children have slow growth and weight gain, frequent (chronic) diarrhea, and foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea). They also have reduced blood cholesterol levels (hypocholesterolemia). Some individuals with chylomicron retention disease develop an abnormal buildup of fats in the liver called hepatic stenosis and can have an enlarged liver.\n\nOther features of chylomicron retention disease develop later in childhood and often impair the function of the nervous system. Affected people may develop decreased reflexes (hyporeflexia) and a decreased ability to sense vibrations. Rarely, affected individuals have heart abnormalities or muscle wasting (amyotrophy).\n\n**Frequency**\n\nChylomicron retention disease is a rare condition with approximately 50 cases described worldwide.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the SAR1B gene cause chylomicron retention disease. The SAR1B gene provides instructions for making a protein that is needed for the transport of molecules called chylomicrons. During digestion, chylomicrons are formed within cells called enterocytes that line the small intestine and absorb nutrients. Chylomicrons are needed to absorb fat-soluble vitamins and carry fats and cholesterol from the small intestine into the bloodstream.\n\nSAR1B gene mutations cause the retention of chylomicrons within enterocytes and prevent their release into the bloodstream. Impaired chylomicron transport causes severely decreased absorption (malabsorption) of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins, leading to nutritional and developmental problems in people with chylomicron retention disease. Affected individuals are unable to absorb sufficient fats, cholesterol, and vitamins that are necessary for normal growth and development.\n\n---\n\n**Chylomicron Retention Disease**\n\nLearn more about the gene associated with Chylomicron retention disease\n\n**Causes and Symptoms**\n\nMutations in a gene called SAR1B cause chylomicron retention disease.

It's characterized by the accumulation of chylomicrons, which are lipoprotein particles that carry dietary fats, in the bloodstream.\n*   **Causes and Inheritance**: The condition is caused by mutations in the SAR1B gene, which codes for a protein involved in lipid metabolism. It's inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the condition.\n*   **Symptoms and Complications**: Symptoms may include abdominal distension, diarrhea, fatty stools, growth retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, hypotonia, muscle weakness, and short stature.

    "content": "**Chylomicronemia Syndrome**\n\nChylomicronemia syndrome is a disorder in which the body does not break down fats (lipids) correctly. This causes fat particles called chylomicrons to build up in the blood. The disorder is passed down through families.\n\n**Causes**\n\nChylomicronemia syndrome can occur due to a rare genetic disorder in which a protein (enzyme) called lipoprotein lipase (LpL) is broken or missing. It can also be caused by the absence of second factor called apolipoprotein C-II (also called apoCII), which activates LpL. LpL is normally found in fat and muscle. It helps break down certain lipids. When LpL is missing or broken, fat particles called chylomicrons build up in the blood. This buildup is called chylomicronemia.\n\nDefects in apolipoprotein CII and apolipoprotein AV can cause the syndrome as well. It is more likely to occur when people who are predisposed to have high triglycerides (such as those who have familial combined hyperlipidemia or familial hypertriglyceridemia) develop diabetes, obesity or are exposed to certain medicines.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms may start in infancy and include:\n\n* Abdominal pain due to pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).\n* Symptoms of nerve damage, such as loss of feeling in the feet or legs, and memory loss.\n* Yellow deposits of fatty material in the skin called xanthomas. These growths may appear on the back, buttocks, soles of the feet, or ankles, knees and elbows.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nA physical exam and tests may show:\n\n* Enlarged liver and spleen\n* Inflammation of the pancreas\n* Fatty deposits under the skin\n* Possibly fatty deposits in the retina of the eye\n\nA creamy layer will appear when blood spins in a laboratory machine. This layer is due to chylomicrons in the blood.\n\nThe triglyceride level is extremely high.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nA low fat, alcohol-free diet is required. You may need to stop taking certain medicines that can make symptoms worse. Do not stop taking any medicine without first talking to your health care provider. Conditions such as dehydration and diabetes can make symptoms worse. If diagnosed, these conditions need to be treated and controlled.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nA low fat diet can reduce symptoms dramatically.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nWhen untreated, the excess chylomicrons may lead to bouts of pancreatitis. This condition can be very painful and even life threatening.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nSeek medical care right away if you have abdominal pain or other warning signs of pancreatitis.\n\nContact your provider if you have a personal or family history of high triglyceride levels.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere is no way to prevent someone from inheriting this syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**Chylomicronemia Syndrome**\n\n**Causes**\n\nChylomicronemia syndrome can occur due to a rare genetic disorder in which a protein (enzyme) called lipoprotein lipase (LpL) is broken or missing.

It is characterized by an inability to produce lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme necessary for breaking down triglycerides in the blood.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of chylomicronemia syndrome is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to genetic mutations that affect the production or function of lipoprotein lipase. There are no known risk factors for developing this condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of chylomicronemia syndrome can vary in severity and may include:\n\n*   **Severe hypertriglyceridemia**: Extremely high levels of triglycerides in the blood, which can lead to pancreatitis, a painful and potentially life-threatening condition.\n*   **Hepatomegaly**: Enlargement of the liver due to fat accumulation.\n*   **Xanthomas**: Yellowish deposits of fat under the skin, often on the knees or elbows.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for chylomicronemia syndrome, but treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. This may include:\n\n*   **Dietary changes**: A low-fat diet to reduce triglyceride levels.\n*   **Medications**: Medications such as fibrates or omega-3 fatty acids may be prescribed to help lower triglycerides.\n*   **Lipid-lowering therapy**: In some cases, lipid-lowering therapy may be necessary to manage extremely high triglyceride levels.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with chylomicronemia syndrome varies depending on the severity of symptoms and the effectiveness of treatment. With proper management, many people can lead normal lives, but others may experience ongoing health issues due to the condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n*   Genest J, Mora S, Libby P.

Chymotrypsin is an enzyme released by the pancreas to help break down protein in food during digestion.\n\n**What does it check for?**\n\nA chymotrypsin in stool test checks for pancreatic insufficiency, a condition where the pancreas releases lower-than-normal amounts of chymotrypsin. This can lead to malnutrition and other health problems.\n\n**Why do I need this test?**\n\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms of pancreatic insufficiency, such as:\n\n* Chronic diarrhea\n* Abdominal pain\n* Bloating and gas\n* Loose, foul-smelling stools\n* Weight loss\n\n**How is the test done?**\n\nTo take the test, you will need to provide a fresh sample of loose or liquid stool. You will be given a container or kit with instructions on how to collect the sample.\n\n**What happens after the test?**\n\nYour provider will analyze the stool sample to determine the amount of chymotrypsin present. The results will show whether your stool sample has a normal or below-normal amount of chymotrypsin.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nA positive result means that your stool sample shows a normal amount of chymotrypsin. A negative result means that the amount of chymotrypsin in your stool sample is below normal, which may indicate pancreatic insufficiency.\n\nIf you have a negative result, your provider will need to order additional tests to diagnose any underlying conditions.\n\n---\n\n**Chymotrypsin in Stool Test**\n\n**What is this test for?**\n\nThis test is used to diagnose pancreatic insufficiency, a condition where the pancreas does not produce enough digestive enzymes. Symptoms of pancreatic insufficiency include:\n\n* Chronic diarrhea\n* Abdominal (belly) pain\n* Bloating and gas\n* Loose, foul-smelling, greasy stools\n* Weight loss\n\n**How is this test performed?**\n\nYou will need to provide a fresh sample of loose or liquid stool for your test. Your provider will probably give you a container or kit with instructions on how to collect the sample.\n\nThere are different ways to collect the stool samples so follow the instructions carefully. In general, you'll need to:\n\n* Label the container with your name, the collection date, and time.\n* Collect a stool sample as instructed. This usually involves using a clean, dry container, or special paper or plastic wrap placed over the toilet to catch the stool.\n* Make sure the stool doesn't mix with any urine, toilet paper or water from the toilet.\n* Close the container tightly.\n* Wash your hands well with soap and water.\n* Return the container according to the instructions.\n\nIf you are unable to return the container right away, you should refrigerate your sample until you're ready to deliver it.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for this test?**\n\nYou may need to stop taking certain medicines before this test, such as if you are taking pancreatic enzymes, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\n**Are there any risks to this test?**\n\nThere is no known risk to having a stool test.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nYour results will show the amount of chymotrypsin in your stool. Your results may also include the amount of trypsin found.\n\nA positive result means that your stool sample shows a normal amount of chymotrypsin and, if it was tested for, trypsin.\n\nA negative result means that the amount of chymotrypsin and/or trypsin in your stool sample is below normal. It may mean that you have pancreatic insufficiency.\n\nIf you have a negative result, this doesn’t diagnose any specific disorders by itself. Your provider will need to order more tests. These may include the following, which measure different pancreatic enzymes:\n\n* Stool elastase\n* Lipase blood test\n* Amylase blood test\n\n**References**\n\nFor further information on this topic, you can visit the following websites:\n\n* CHOC: Stool Tests\n* Cleveland Clinic: Pancreas\n* Cleveland Clinic: Pancreatitis\n* Ghodeif AO, Azer SA.

    "content": "**Ciclesonide Nasal Spray**\n\n\\n\\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCiclesonide nasal spray is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal (occurs only at certain times of the year), and perennial (occurs all year round) allergic rhinitis. These symptoms include sneezing and stuffy, runny or itchy nose. Ciclesonide is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works by preventing and decreasing inflammation (swelling that can cause other symptoms) in the nose.\n\n\\n\\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCiclesonide comes as a solution (liquid) to spray in the nose. It is usually sprayed in each nostril once daily. Use ciclesonide at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use ciclesonide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nCiclesonide nasal spray is only for use in the nose. Do not swallow the nasal spray and be careful not to spray it in your eyes or directly onto the nasal septum (the wall between the two nostrils).\n\nCiclesonide controls the symptoms of rhinitis but does not cure it. Your symptoms probably will not begin to improve for at least 24-48 hours after your first dose and it may be longer before you feel the full benefit of ciclesonide. Continue to use ciclesonide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking ciclesonide without talking to your doctor.\n\nEach bottle of ciclesonide nasal spray is designed to provide 120 sprays after the bottle is primed initially. The bottle must be disposed of after 4 months of use. You should count 4 months from the date that the bottle is removed from the foil pouch and write it on the sticker that is provided in the carton. Place the sticker in the space provided on the bottle to remind you of this date. It is also important to keep track of the number of sprays you have used and dispose of the bottle after you have used 120 sprays, even if the bottle still contains some liquid and it is before the 4 months have passed.\n\n\\n\\n**To use the nasal spray:**\n\n1. Shake the bottle gently and remove the dust cover.\n2. If you are using the pump for the first time, point the bottle away from your body and press down and release the pump eight times. If you have used the pump before but not within the last 4 days, press down and release the pump one time or until you see a fine spray.\n3. Blow your nose until your nostrils are clear.\n4. Hold one nostril closed with your finger.\n5. With your other hand, hold the bottle firmly with your forefinger and middle finger on either side of the spray tip while supporting the base of the bottle with your thumb.\n6. Tilt your head slightly forward and carefully put the tip of the nasal applicator into your open nostril keeping the bottle upright. Begin to breathe through your nose.\n7. While you are breathing in, use your forefinger and middle finger to press quickly and firmly down on the applicator and release a spray.\n8. Repeat steps 4-7 in the other nostril, unless your doctor has told you otherwise.\n9. Wipe the applicator tip with a clean tissue and replace the dust cover.\n\n---\n\n**Ciclesonide Nasal Spray: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How to Use Ciclesonide Nasal Spray**\n\nTo use the nasal spray, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Shake the Bottle**: Shake the bottle gently.\n2. **Remove Dust Cover**: Remove the dust cover.\n3. **Prime the Pump**: If you are using the pump for the first time, point the bottle away from your body and press down and release the pump eight times.

Tilt your head slightly forward and carefully put the tip of the nasal applicator into your open nostril keeping the bottle upright.\n7. **Breathe In**: Begin to breathe through your nose.\n8. **Spray the Medicine**: While you are breathing in, use your forefinger and middle finger to press quickly and firmly down on the applicator and release a spray.\n9. **Repeat in the Other Nostril**: Repeat steps 4-7 in the other nostril, unless your doctor has told you otherwise.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Dosage Information**\n\nCiclesonide comes as a solution (liquid) to spray in the nose. It is usually sprayed in each nostril once daily. Use ciclesonide at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Special Precautions**\n\nBefore using ciclesonide nasal spray:\n\n* Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to ciclesonide; any other nasal corticosteroid such as beclomethasone (Beconase AQ), budesonide (Rhinocort Aqua), fluticasone (Flonase), momentasone (Flonase), triamcinolone (Nasacort AQ); or any other medications.\n* Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while using ciclesonide nasal spray. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n* Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had tuberculosis (TB), cataracts (clouding of the lens in your eye), or glaucoma (an eye disease), and if you now have sores in your nose, any type of untreated infection, or a herpes infection of your eye (a type of infection that causes a sore on the eyelid or surface of your eye). Also tell your doctor if you have recently had surgery on your nose or injured your nose in any way.\n* Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking ciclesonide, call your doctor.\n* If you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking ciclesonide.\n* If you have been taking oral steroids such as dexamethasone (Decadron, Dexone), methylprednisolone (Medrol), prednisolone (Pediapred, Prelone) or prednisone (Deltasone) your doctor may want to gradually decrease your steroid dose after you begin using ciclesonide.\n\n---\n\n**Ciclesonide Nasal Spray: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 3/4)**\n\n**Special Instructions**\n\nIf you are taking oral steroids, such as dexamethasone (Decadron), methylprednisolone (Medrol), prednisolone (Pediapred, Prelone) or prednisone (Deltasone), your doctor may want to gradually decrease your steroid dose after you begin using ciclesonide. Special caution is needed for several months as your body adjusts to the change in medication.\n\nIf you have any other medical conditions, such as asthma, arthritis, or eczema (a skin disease), they may worsen when your oral steroid dose is decreased. Tell your doctor if this happens or if you experience any of the following symptoms during this time:\n\n* extreme tiredness\n* muscle weakness or pain\n* sudden pain in stomach, lower body or legs\n* loss of appetite\n* weight loss\n* upset stomach\n* vomiting\n* diarrhea\n* dizziness\n* fainting\n* depression\n* irritability\n* and darkening of skin.\n\nYour body may be less able to cope with stress such as surgery, illness, severe asthma attack, or injury during this time. Call your doctor right away if you get sick and be sure that all health care providers who treat you know that you recently replaced your oral steroid with ciclesonide inhalation. Carry a card or wear a medical identification bracelet to let emergency personnel know that you may need to be treated with steroids in an emergency.\n\n**Side Effects**\n\nCiclesonide may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* headache\n* nosebleed\n* burning or irritation in the nose\n* earache\n\nSome side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms call your doctor immediately:\n\n* painful white patches in nose or throat\n* flu-like symptoms\n* vision problems\n* injury to nose\n* new or increased acne (pimples)\n* easy bruising\n* enlarged face and neck\n* extreme tiredness\n* muscle weakness\n* irregular menstruation (periods)\n* hives\n* rash\n* itching\n* swelling of the face, throat, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles or lower legs\n* hoarseness\n* difficulty breathing or swallowing\n* wheezing\n\nCiclesonide may cause children to grow more slowly. It is not known whether using ciclesonide decreases the final adult height that children will reach. Talk to your doctor about the risks of giving this medication to your child.\n\n**Storage and Disposal**\n\nKeep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not freeze.\n\nDispose of unneeded medications in a way so that pets, children, and other people cannot take them. Do not flush this medication down the toilet. Use a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist about take-back programs in your community. Visit the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website for more information.\n\nKeep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers are not child-resistant. Always lock safety caps. Place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.\n\n---\n\n**Ciclesonide Nasal Spray: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**In Case of Emergency/Overdose**\n\nIf someone swallows ciclesonide, call your local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222. If the victim has collapsed or is not breathing, call local emergency services at 911.\n\nUsing too much ciclesonide on a regular basis over a long period of time may cause the following symptoms:\n\n*   **Enlarged face and neck**\n*   **New or worsening acne**\n*   **Easy bruising**\n*   **Extreme tiredness**\n*   **Muscle weakness**\n*   **Irregular menstrual periods**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Other Information Should I Know?**\n\nKeep all appointments with your doctor.\n\nIf your applicator becomes clogged, remove the dust cap and gently pull upwards to free the nasal applicator. Wash the dust cap and applicator with warm water. Dry and replace the applicator and press down and release the pump one time or until you see a fine spray. Replace the dust cap. Do not use pins or other sharp objects in the tiny spray hole on the nasal applicator to remove the blockage.\n\nDo not let anyone else take your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription.\n\nKeep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines, vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements you are taking. Bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to the hospital. You should carry the list with you in case of emergencies.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Brand Names**\n\n*   **Omnaris**\n*   **Zetonna**",

    "content": "**Ciclesonide Oral Inhalation**\n\n*pronounced as (sye kles' oh nide)*\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCiclesonide oral inhalation is used to prevent difficulty breathing, chest tightness, wheezing, and coughing caused by asthma in adults and children 12 years of age and older. Ciclesonide is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works by decreasing swelling and irritation in the airways to allow for easier breathing.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCiclesonide comes as an aerosol to inhale by mouth using an inhaler. Ciclesonide is usually inhaled twice a day. Try to use ciclesonide at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n\nUse ciclesonide inhalation exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nTalk to your doctor about how you should use your other oral and inhaled medications for asthma during your treatment with ciclesonide inhalation. If you are using any other inhaled medications, ask your doctor if you should inhale these medications a certain amount of time before and after you inhale ciclesonide inhalation.\n\nIf you were taking an oral steroid such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone (Rayos), your doctor may want to gradually decrease your steroid dose starting at least one week after you begin to use ciclesonide inhalation.\n\nCiclesonide inhalation helps to prevent asthma attacks (sudden episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing) but will not stop an asthma attack that has already started. Do not use ciclesonide inhalation during an asthma attack. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks.\n\nYour doctor will probably start you on an average dose of ciclesonide inhalation. Your doctor may increase it if your symptoms have not improved after at least 4 weeks and later may decrease your dose when your symptoms are controlled.\n\nCiclesonide inhalation controls asthma but does not cure it. It may take 4 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of the medication. Continue to use ciclesonide inhalation even if you feel well. Do not stop using ciclesonide inhalation without talking to your doctor.\n\nTell your doctor if your asthma worsens during your treatment. Call your doctor if you have an asthma attack that does not stop when you use your fast-acting asthma medication, or if you need to use more of your fast-acting medication than usual.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nThe inhaler that comes with ciclesonide aerosol is designed for use only with a canister of ciclesonide. Never use it to inhale any other medication, and never use any other inhaler to inhale ciclesonide.\n\nEach canister of ciclesonide aerosol is designed to provide 60 inhalations. After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication. Your inhaler comes with an attached counter that will change as every 10 sprays are used. When the number that shows on the counter is 20, you should call your doctor or pharmacist to refill your prescription. When the number that shows on the counter is 0, you should not use that canister anymore.\n\nYou should also keep track of the number of inhalations you use each day to know the exact amount of sprays that remain in your inhaler. Throw away the canister after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed. If your inhaler is dropped, do not use the number on the counter to predict the number of sprays left in your inhaler.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you forget a dose of ciclesonide inhalation, take it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule. Do not use extra doses or increase your dose.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nCiclesonide inhalation may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* hoarseness\n* sore throat\n* coughing\n* runny nose\n* headache\n* dizziness\n\nCall your doctor for medical advice about side effects.\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nStore ciclesonide inhalation at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Keep ciclesonide inhalation out of the reach of children.\n\nDo not use ciclesonide inhalation after the expiration date on the label. Do not dispose of ciclesonide inhalation in wastewater or sewage. Dispose of used canisters responsibly.\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nCiclesonide oral inhalation is a prescription medication and should only be used under the guidance of a doctor.

Never use it to inhale any other medication, and never use any other inhaler to inhale ciclesonide.\n\nEach canister of ciclesonide aerosol is designed to provide 60 inhalations. After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication. Your inhaler comes with an attached counter that will change as every 10 sprays are used. When the number that shows on the counter is 20, you should call your doctor or pharmacist to refill your prescription. When the number that shows on the counter is 0, you should not use that canister anymore.\n\n**Cleaning and Maintenance**\n\nClean your inhaler once a week. To clean your inhaler, use a clean, dry tissue or cloth. Do not wash or put any part of your inhaler in water.\n\n**Important Safety Information**\n\nDo not use your ciclesonide inhaler while you are near an open flame or a heat source.

Your body may be less able to cope with stress such as surgery, illness, severe asthma attack, or injury during this time. Call your doctor right away if you get sick and be sure that all healthcare providers who treat you know that you recently replaced your oral steroid with ciclesonide inhalation. Carry a card or wear a medical identification bracelet to let emergency personnel know that you may need to be treated with steroids in an emergency.\n\nTell your doctor if you have never had chickenpox or measles and you have not been vaccinated against these infections. Stay away from people who are sick, especially people who have chickenpox or measles. If you are exposed to one of these infections or if you develop symptoms of one of these infections, call your doctor right away.

    "content": "**Cilostazol: MedlinePlus Drug Information (Part 1/3)**\n\n**Why is this medication prescribed?**\n\nCilostazol is used to reduce the symptoms of intermittent claudication (pain in the legs that worsens when walking and improves when resting) caused by narrowing of the blood vessels that supply blood to the legs. Cilostazol is in a class of medications called platelet-aggregation inhibitors (antiplatelet medications). It works by improving blood flow to the legs.\n\n**How should this medicine be used?**\n\nCilostazol comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day, at least 30 minutes before or 2 hours after breakfast and dinner. Take cilostazol at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on the prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cilostazol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n**Other uses for this medicine**\n\nThis medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n**What special precautions should I follow?**\n\nBefore taking cilostazol, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to cilostazol, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in cilostazol. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients. Tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking cilostazol. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n\n**What should I do if I forget a dose?**\n\nIf you forget to take a dose of cilostazol, take it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule. Do not take two doses at once unless directed by your doctor.\n\n**What side effects can this medication cause?**\n\nCilostazol may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n\n* dizziness\n* headache\n* nausea\n* stomach pain\n\n**What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?**\n\nKeep cilostazol in its original container at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.\n\n**In case of emergency/overdose**\n\nIf you have taken too much cilostazol or if someone else has taken it by mistake, call your local poison control center or emergency room right away. If the victim is having symptoms such as seizures, difficulty breathing, or loss of consciousness, call 911 immediately.\n\n**What other information should I know?**\n\nCilostazol controls the symptoms of intermittent claudication but does not cure it.
