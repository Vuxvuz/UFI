For most people with overweight, cutting about 500 calories a day is a good place to start. If you can eat 500 fewer calories every day, you should lose about a pound (454 g) a week. Always talk with your health care provider to determine a healthy weight for you before starting a weight-loss diet. How to Cut Calories Try these 10 ways to cut 500 calories every day. It is easier than you may think. Swap your snack. Many people reach for a snack or two in between meals. Snacking is fine as long as you choose options that will fill up with fewer calories. The key is to have some healthy snacks ready when hunger hits. Instead of a 3-ounce (85 g) bag of flavored tortilla chips (425 calories), choose a cup (240 mL) of air-popped popcorn (31 calories), a cup (240 mL) of grapes and a low-fat cheese stick or a small apple and 12 almonds (80 calories). Choosing healthy snacks twice a day will easily save you 500 calories. Cut one high-calorie treat. Try to remove one high-calorie food item each day. Whether it is a donut in the morning, a brownie or bag of chips at lunch, or chocolate cake after dinner, you will save 250 to 350 calories or more. To burn another 150 calories, take a 40-minute brisk walk after lunch or dinner. Do not drink your calories. One 12-ounce (355 mL) regular soda has about 150 calories, and a 16-ounce (475 mL) flavored latte can pack 250 calories or more. Even fruit smoothies have lots of calories, as many as 400 in a 16-ounce (475 mL) serving. A couple of sweet drinks a day can easily add up to 500 calories or more. Choose water, plain or flavored, sparkling water, or black coffee or tea instead and save your calories for foods that will help you feel full. Skip seconds. Taking a second helping can add up to unwanted calories. It is easy to keep filling your plate when you serve food family style on the table. Instead, fill your plate once and keep extras in the kitchen. Or, if you still do not feel satisfied, add a second helping of vegetables, fruit, or salad. Make low calorie substitutions. Substitute lower-calorie options for some of your high-calorie favorites. For example, if a recipe calls for a cup (240 mL) of sour cream (455 calories), use a cup (240 mL) of plain low-fat yogurt or Greek yogurt instead (220 calories). Ask for a doggie bag. The portions at many restaurants are much larger than recommended serving sizes. Instead of cleaning your whole plate, ask the server to put half in a container for you to take home for another meal. You can also share an entrée with a friend, or make a meal out of an appetizer and a large salad. Just be sure to go easy on the dressing and fried toppings. Just say \"no\" to fried food. Frying food can add lots of unhealthy calories and saturated fat to any dish. Instead of fried chicken or fish, choose grilled, broiled, or poached instead. And skip the French fries. A large serving of fries alone can add almost 500 calories to a meal. Instead, see if you can substitute for the vegetable of the day or a side salad. Build a thinner pizza. Skip the meat toppings, extra cheese, and deep-dish crust, and have a couple slices of thin-crust vegetable pizza instead. You will save a little over 500 calories. Use a plate. Eat all food from a plate or bowl, including snacks. When you snack out of a bag or box, it is easy to eat more than you intend to. This is especially true if you are sitting in front of the TV. You may be surprised to learn that a large bag of chips could be more than 1000 calories. Instead, place one portion in a bowl, and put the rest away. Avoid alcohol. Cutting back on alcohol is an easy way for many people to trim calories. Alcohol does not have any nutritional value, so when you imbibe (drink) alcohol, you are getting empty calories, up to 500 for some mixed drinks made with syrupy sweeteners, fruit juices, and ice cream or heavy cream. If you do order a drink, choose a 12-ounce (355 mL) light beer (103 calories) or a 5-ounce (145 mL) glass of wine (120 calories).

  "-7584722432508071338": "10q26 deletion syndrome 10q26 deletion syndrome Description Collapse Section 10q26 deletion syndrome is a condition that results from the loss (deletion) of a small piece of chromosome 10 in each cell. The deletion occurs on the long (q) arm of the chromosome at a position designated 10q26. The signs and symptoms of 10q26 deletion syndrome vary widely, even among affected members of the same family. Among the more common features associated with this chromosomal change are distinctive facial features, mild to moderate intellectual disability, growth problems, and developmental delay. People with 10q26 deletion syndrome often have delayed development of speech and of motor skills such as sitting, crawling, and walking. Some have limited speech throughout life. Affected individuals may experience seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), poor impulse control (impulsivity), or exhibit autistic behaviors that affect communication and social interaction. A range of facial features is seen in people with 10q26 deletion syndrome, but not all affected individuals have these features. Facial features of people with 10q26 deletion syndrome may include a prominent or beaked nose, a broad nasal bridge, a small jaw (micrognathia), malformed ears that are low set, a thin upper lip, and an unusually small head size (microcephaly). Many affected individuals have widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism) that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). Some people with this condition have a short neck with extra folds of skin (webbed neck). Less common signs and symptoms can occur in 10q26 deletion syndrome. Skeletal problems include a spine that curves to the side (scoliosis), limited movement in the elbows or other joints, or curved fifth fingers and toes (clinodactyly). Slow growth before and after birth can also occur in affected individuals. Males with this condition may have genital abnormalities, such as a small penis (micropenis), undescended testes (cryptorchidism), or the urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias). Some people with 10q26 deletion syndrome have kidney abnormalities, heart defects, breathing problems, recurrent infections, or hearing or vision problems.

Facial features of people with 10q26 deletion syndrome may include a prominent or beaked nose, a broad nasal bridge, a small jaw (micrognathia), malformed ears that are low set, a thin upper lip, and an unusually small head size (microcephaly). Many affected individuals have widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism) that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). Some people with this condition have a short neck with extra folds of skin (webbed neck). Less common signs and symptoms can occur in 10q26 deletion syndrome. Skeletal problems include a spine that curves to the side (scoliosis), limited movement in the elbows or other joints, or curved fifth fingers and toes (clinodactyly). Slow growth before and after birth can also occur in affected individuals. Males with this condition may have genital abnormalities, such as a small penis (micropenis), undescended testes (cryptorchidism), or the urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias). Some people with 10q26 deletion syndrome have kidney abnormalities, heart defects, breathing problems, recurrent infections, or hearing or vision problems. 10q26 deletion syndrome is a condition that results from the loss (deletion) of a small piece of chromosome 10 in each cell. The deletion occurs on the long (q) arm of the chromosome at a position designated 10q26. The signs and symptoms of 10q26 deletion syndrome vary widely, even among affected members of the same family. Among the more common features associated with this chromosomal change are distinctive facial features, mild to moderate intellectual disability, growth problems, and developmental delay. People with 10q26 deletion syndrome often have delayed development of speech and of motor skills such as sitting, crawling, and walking. Some have limited speech throughout life.

  "2813534349347729630": "10 ways to cut 500 calories a day No matter what type of diet you follow, to lose weight you need to burn more calories than you take in each day. For most people with overweight, cutting about 500 calories a day is a good place to start. If you can eat 500 fewer calories every day, you should lose about a pound (454 g) a week. Always talk with your health care provider to determine a healthy weight for you before starting a weight-loss diet. How to Cut Calories Try these 10 ways to cut 500 calories every day. It is easier than you may think. Swap your snack. Many people reach for a snack or two in between meals. Snacking is fine as long as you choose options that will fill up with fewer calories. The key is to have some healthy snacks ready when hunger hits. Instead of a 3-ounce (85 g) bag of flavored tortilla chips (425 calories), choose a cup (240 mL) of air-popped popcorn (31 calories), a cup (240 mL) of grapes and a low-fat cheese stick or a small apple and 12 almonds (80 calories). Choosing healthy snacks twice a day will easily save you 500 calories. Cut one high-calorie treat. Try to remove one high-calorie food item each day. Whether it is a donut in the morning, a brownie or bag of chips at lunch, or chocolate cake after dinner, you will save 250 to 350 calories or more. To burn another 150 calories, take a 40-minute brisk walk after lunch or dinner. Do not drink your calories. One 12-ounce (355 mL) regular soda has about 150 calories, and a 16-ounce (475 mL) flavored latte can pack 250 calories or more. Even fruit smoothies have lots of calories, as many as 400 in a 16-ounce (475 mL) serving. A couple of sweet drinks a day can easily add up to 500 calories or more. Choose water, plain or flavored, sparkling water, or black coffee or tea instead and save your calories for foods that will help you feel full. Skip seconds. Taking a second helping can add up to unwanted calories. It is easy to keep filling your plate when you serve food family style on the table. Instead, fill your plate once and keep extras in the kitchen. Or, if you still do not feel satisfied, add a second helping of vegetables, fruit, or salad. Make low calorie substitutions. Substitute lower-calorie options for some of your high-calorie favorites. For example, if a recipe calls for a cup (240 mL) of sour cream (455 calories), use a cup (240 mL) of plain low-fat yogurt or Greek yogurt instead (220 calories). Ask for a doggie bag. The portions at many restaurants are much larger than recommended serving sizes. Instead of cleaning your whole plate, ask the server to put half in a container for you to take home for another meal. You can also share an entrée with a friend, or make a meal out of an appetizer and a large salad. Just be sure to go easy on the dressing and fried toppings. Just say \"no\" to fried food. Frying food can add lots of unhealthy calories and saturated fat to any dish. Instead of fried chicken or fish, choose grilled, broiled, or poached instead. And skip the French fries. A large serving of fries alone can add almost 500 calories to a meal. Instead, see if you can substitute for the vegetable of the day or a side salad. Build a thinner pizza. Skip the meat toppings, extra cheese, and deep-dish crust, and have a couple slices of thin-crust vegetable pizza instead. You will save a little over 500 calories. Use a plate. Eat all food from a plate or bowl, including snacks. When you snack out of a bag or box, it is easy to eat more than you intend to. This is especially true if you are sitting in front of the TV. You may be surprised to learn that a large bag of chips could be more than 1000 calories. Instead, place one portion in a bowl, and put the rest away. Avoid alcohol. Cutting back on alcohol is an easy way for many people to trim calories. Alcohol does not have any nutritional value, so when you imbibe (drink) alcohol, you are getting empty calories, up to 500 for some mixed drinks made with syrupy sweeteners, fruit juices, and ice cream or heavy cream. If you do order a drink, choose a 12-ounce (355 mL) light beer (103 calories) or a 5-ounce (145 mL) glass of wine (120 calories).

If you do order a drink, choose a 12-ounce (355 mL) light beer (103 calories) or a 5-ounce (145 mL) glass of wine (120 calories). How to Cut Calories How to Cut Calories Expand Section Try these 10 ways to cut 500 calories every day. It is easier than you may think. Swap your snack. Many people reach for a snack or two in between meals. Snacking is fine as long as you choose options that will fill up with fewer calories. The key is to have some healthy snacks ready when hunger hits. Instead of a 3-ounce (85 g) bag of flavored tortilla chips (425 calories), choose a cup (240 mL) of air-popped popcorn (31 calories), a cup (240 mL) of grapes and a low-fat cheese stick or a small apple and 12 almonds (80 calories). Choosing healthy snacks twice a day will easily save you 500 calories. Cut one high-calorie treat. Try to remove one high-calorie food item each day. Whether it is a donut in the morning, a brownie or bag of chips at lunch, or chocolate cake after dinner, you will save 250 to 350 calories or more. To burn another 150 calories, take a 40-minute brisk walk after lunch or dinner. Do not drink your calories. One 12-ounce (355 mL) regular soda has about 150 calories, and a 16-ounce (475 mL) flavored latte can pack 250 calories or more. Even fruit smoothies have lots of calories, as many as 400 in a 16-ounce (475 mL) serving. A couple of sweet drinks a day can easily add up to 500 calories or more. Choose water, plain or flavored, sparkling water, or black coffee or tea instead and save your calories for foods that will help you feel full. Skip seconds. Taking a second helping can add up to unwanted calories. It is easy to keep filling your plate when you serve food family style on the table. Instead, fill your plate once and keep extras in the kitchen. Or, if you still do not feel satisfied, add a second helping of vegetables, fruit, or salad. Make low calorie substitutions. Substitute lower-calorie options for some of your high-calorie favorites. For example, if a recipe calls for a cup (240 mL) of sour cream (455 calories), use a cup (240 mL) of plain low-fat yogurt or Greek yogurt instead (220 calories). Ask for a doggie bag. The portions at many restaurants are much larger than recommended serving sizes. Instead of cleaning your whole plate, ask the server to put half in a container for you to take home for another meal. You can also share an entrée with a friend, or make a meal out of an appetizer and a large salad. Just be sure to go easy on the dressing and fried toppings. Just say \"no\" to fried food. Frying food can add lots of unhealthy calories and saturated fat to any dish. Instead of fried chicken or fish, choose grilled, broiled, or poached instead. And skip the French fries. A large serving of fries alone can add almost 500 calories to a meal. Instead, see if you can substitute for the vegetable of the day or a side salad. Build a thinner pizza. Skip the meat toppings, extra cheese, and deep-dish crust, and have a couple slices of thin-crust vegetable pizza instead. You will save a little over 500 calories. Use a plate. Eat all food from a plate or bowl, including snacks. When you snack out of a bag or box, it is easy to eat more than you intend to. This is especially true if you are sitting in front of the TV. You may be surprised to learn that a large bag of chips could be more than 1000 calories. Instead, place one portion in a bowl, and put the rest away. Avoid alcohol.

The deletion occurs on the long (q) arm of the chromosome at a position designated 10q26. The signs and symptoms of 10q26 deletion syndrome vary widely, even among affected members of the same family. Among the more common features associated with this chromosomal change are distinctive facial features, mild to moderate intellectual disability, growth problems, and developmental delay. People with 10q26 deletion syndrome often have delayed development of speech and of motor skills such as sitting, crawling, and walking. Some have limited speech throughout life. Affected individuals may experience seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), poor impulse control (impulsivity), or exhibit autistic behaviors that affect communication and social interaction. A range of facial features is seen in people with 10q26 deletion syndrome, but not all affected individuals have these features. Facial features of people with 10q26 deletion syndrome may include a prominent or beaked nose, a broad nasal bridge, a small jaw (micrognathia), malformed ears that are low set, a thin upper lip, and an unusually small head size (microcephaly). Many affected individuals have widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism) that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). Some people with this condition have a short neck with extra folds of skin (webbed neck). Less common signs and symptoms can occur in 10q26 deletion syndrome. Skeletal problems include a spine that curves to the side (scoliosis), limited movement in the elbows or other joints, or curved fifth fingers and toes (clinodactyly). Slow growth before and after birth can also occur in affected individuals. Males with this condition may have genital abnormalities, such as a small penis (micropenis), undescended testes (cryptorchidism), or the urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias). Some people with 10q26 deletion syndrome have kidney abnormalities, heart defects, breathing problems, recurrent infections, or hearing or vision problems.

  "5280204227295096025": "12 healthy snacks with 200 calories or less Snacks are small, quick mini-meals. Snacks are eaten between meals and help keep you from being hungry. Including a protein source (such as nuts, beans, or low-fat or fat-free dairy) or a whole grain (such as whole wheat bread) can give snacks more \"staying power\" so you will not get hungry again as quickly. Healthy snacks are: Whole grain Low-salt Low in added sugar Fresh foods like fruits and vegetables Snacks List Here are a dozen healthy snack ideas you can try: One medium apple or pear with 12 almonds Half cup (120 milliliters, mL) of berries with 6 ounces (oz), or 170 grams (g), of plain yogurt or low-fat cottage cheese One small banana with 1 tablespoon (tbsp), or (15 mL), unsalted peanut butter or almond butter One quarter cup (60 mL) trail mix with dried fruits and nuts (with no added sugar or salt) Three cups (720 mL) air popped popcorn with 2 tbsp (30 mL) shredded parmesan cheese One cup (240 mL) of grapes or cherry tomatoes with one low-fat string cheese One cup (240 mL) raw carrots, broccoli, or bell peppers with 2 tbsp (30 mL) of hummus or black bean dip One cup (240 mL) tomato soup with five whole grain crackers One third cup (80 mL) rolled oats cooked in 1 cup (240 mL) fat-free milk with cinnamon A hard-boiled egg and 12 almonds Fruit smoothie with 1 cup (240 mL) fat-free milk, half a small banana, and half cup (120 mL) berries Five whole wheat crackers and 1 oz (30 g) low-fat cheddar cheese Why Snacks can be Good for you Snacks can be good for you, as long as you include healthy choices and amounts. For example, you can put the desired amount of food on a plate rather than eating directly from the bag. Small snacks between meals can keep you from overeating at mealtimes and help you manage your weight. If you have diabetes, a balanced snack can help stabilize your blood sugar. Just be sure you count the grams of carbohydrates. Healthy snacks for adults can provide energy for work and exercise. Healthy snacks and drinks for children provide much needed energy for growth, school, and sports. Offer young children healthy snacks, and they may be more likely to choose them on their own as they get older. Eating a variety of snacks like the ones above will give you extra vitamins, minerals, fiber, antioxidants (substances that help prevent cell damage), and other disease-fighting nutrients. Limit high-calorie sports drinks and packaged, processed snacks, likes chips or cookies. Include a glass of water with your snack instead of a sweetened beverage. Avoid snacks with added sugar to help you maintain healthy teeth and gums.

The deletion occurs near the middle of the chromosome at a location designated p11.2. People with 16p11.2 deletion syndrome usually have developmental delay and intellectual disability. Most also have at least some features of autism spectrum disorders. These disorders are characterized by impaired communication and socialization skills, as well as delayed development of speech and language. In 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, expressive language skills (vocabulary and the production of speech) are generally more severely affected than receptive language skills (the ability to understand speech). Some people with this disorder have recurrent seizures (epilepsy). Some affected individuals have minor physical abnormalities such as low-set ears or partially webbed toes (partial syndactyly). People with this disorder are also at increased risk of obesity compared with the general population. However, there is no particular pattern of physical abnormalities that characterizes 16p11.2 deletion syndrome. Signs and symptoms of the disorder vary even among affected members of the same family. Some people with the deletion have no identified physical, intellectual, or behavioral abnormalities.

  "-406999368991391043": "16p11.2 duplication 16p11.2 duplication Description Collapse Section 16p11.2 duplication is a chromosomal change in which a small amount of genetic material within chromosome 16 is abnormally copied (duplicated). The duplication occurs near the middle of the chromosome at a location designated p11.2. This duplication can have a variety of effects. Common characteristics that occur in people with a 16p11.2 duplication include a low weight; a small head size (microcephaly); and developmental delay, especially in speech and language. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of behavioral problems. However, some people with the duplication have no identified physical or behavioral abnormalities. Developmental delay and intellectual disability can occur in people with a 16p11.2 duplication. Approximately one-third of children with this condition have delays in developing physical skills such as sitting, crawling, or walking. The average IQ of affected individuals is about 26 points lower than that of their parents without the duplication. About 80 percent of people with a 16p11.2 duplication have problems related to speech or language. Both expressive language skills (vocabulary and the production of speech) and receptive language skills (the ability to understand speech) can be affected. One of the most common behavioral problems associated with this chromosomal change is attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Autism spectrum disorder, which affects communication and social skills, is diagnosed in about one in five people with a 16p11.2 duplication. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of mental health problems, including schizophrenia, anxiety, and depression. Recurrent seizures are possible in this condition, although they do not occur in most affected individuals. Other abnormalities that can occur with a 16p11.2 duplication include malformations of the kidneys and urinary tract. However, there is no particular pattern of physical abnormalities that characterizes 16p11.2 duplications; signs and symptoms related to the chromosomal change vary even among affected members of the same family.

Causes Expand Section Causes Expand Section Causes Expand Section People with a 16p11.2 duplication have an extra copy of a segment of genetic material on the short (p) arm of chromosome 16 at a position known as p11.2. This duplication affects one of the two copies of chromosome 16 in each cell. The length of the duplicated segment is most often about 600,000 DNA building blocks (base pairs), also written as 600 kilobases (kb). The 600 kb region contains more than 25 genes, and little is known about the function of most of these genes.

The gonads direct sexual development before birth and during puberty and are important for reproduction. The adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys, regulate the production of certain hormones, including those that control salt levels in the body. People with 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency have an imbalance of many of the hormones that are made in these glands. 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency is one of a group of disorders, known as congenital adrenal hyperplasias, that impair hormone production and disrupt sexual development and maturation. Hormone imbalances lead to the characteristic signs and symptoms of 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency, which include high blood pressure (hypertension), low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia), and abnormal sexual development. The severity of the features varies. Two forms of the condition are recognized: complete 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency, which is more severe, and partial 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency, which is typically less so. Males and females are affected by disruptions to sexual development differently. Females (who have two X chromosomes) with 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency are born with normal external female genitalia; however, the internal reproductive organs, including the uterus and ovaries, may be underdeveloped. Women with complete 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency do not develop secondary sex characteristics, such as breasts and pubic hair, and do not menstruate (amenorrhea). Women with partial 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency may develop some secondary sex characteristics; menstruation is typically irregular or absent. Either form of the disorder results in an inability to conceive a baby (infertility). In affected individuals who are chromosomally male (having an X and a Y chromosome), problems with sexual development lead to abnormalities of the external genitalia. The most severely affected are born with characteristically female external genitalia and are generally raised as females. However, because they do not have female internal reproductive organs, these individuals have amenorrhea and do not develop female secondary sex characteristics. These individuals have testes, but they are abnormally located in the abdomen (undescended). Sometimes, complete 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency leads to external genitalia that do not look clearly male or clearly female. Males with partial 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency may have a small penis (micropenis), the opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis (hypospadias), or a scrotum divided into two lobes (bifid scrotum). Males with either complete or partial 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency are also infertile.

Causes Expand Section Causes Expand Section Causes Expand Section 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency is caused by mutations in the CYP17A1 gene. The protein produced from this gene is involved in the formation of steroid hormones. This group of hormones includes sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen, which are needed for normal sexual development and reproduction; mineralocorticoids, which help regulate the body's salt and water balance; and glucocorticoids, which are involved in maintaining blood sugar (glucose) levels and regulating the body's response to stress.Steroid hormones are produced through a series of chemical reactions. The CYP17A1 enzyme performs two important reactions in this process. The enzyme has 17 alpha(α)-hydroxylase activity, which is important for production of glucocorticoids and sex hormones. CYP17A1 also has 17,20-lyase activity, which is integral to the production of sex hormones.17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency results from a shortage (deficiency) of both enzyme activities. The amount of remaining enzyme activity determines whether a person will have the complete or partial form of the disorder. Individuals with the complete form have CYP17A1 gene mutations that result in the production of an enzyme with very little or no 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activity. People with the partial form of this condition have CYP17A1 gene mutations that allow some enzyme activity, although at reduced levels.With little or no 17α-hydroxylase activity, production of glucocorticoids is impaired, and instead, mineralocorticoids are produced. An excess of these salt-regulating hormones leads to hypertension and hypokalemia.Loss of 17,20-lyase activity impairs sex hormone production. Shortage of these hormones disrupts development of the reproductive system and impairs the onset of puberty in males and females with 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency.

  "-7021607504576752544": "17-Hydroxyprogesterone 17-Hydroxyprogesterone What is a 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) test? This test measures the amount of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) in a sample of your blood. 17-OHP is a substance that your adrenal glands make. Your adrenal glands are two small organs that sit on top of each kidney. They make different types of hormones you need to stay alive and healthy. Hormones are chemical messengers in your bloodstream that control the actions of certain cells or organs. Normally, your adrenal glands use 17-OHP to make a hormone called cortisol. Cortisol helps control your energy levels, blood glucose (sugar), blood pressure, and your body's response to stress, illness and injury. A 17-OHP test helps diagnose a group of uncommon, inherited genetic disorders that affect how well your adrenal glands make cortisol. These genetic adrenal gland disorders are called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). People with CAH have a change in a gene that causes the lack of an enzyme that your adrenal glands need to make hormones. The most common type of CAH is caused by a lack of an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase. 21-hydroxylase helps your adrenal glands use 17-OHP to make cortisol. Without enough 21-hydroxylase, the adrenal glands struggle to make enough cortisol. As the adrenal glands work harder to do their job, they become enlarged and make abnormally high levels of 17-OHP. These high levels of 17-OHP are a sign of CAH with 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The adrenal glands use the extra 17-OHP to make larger than normal amounts of male sex hormones. This happens in children and adults of both sexes. So, tests for male hormones, including testosterone, are often used with 17-OHP tests to help diagnose CAH. The symptoms of CAH depend on how much cortisol the adrenal glands are able to make. CAH is often organized into two groups based on how severe the symptoms are: Classic CAH includes the most severe forms of the disorder. It's usually diagnosed at birth. Without diagnosis and treatment, severe CAH can be life-threatening. Serious symptoms may show up shortly after birth. They may include: Dehydration Low blood pressure An irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) Shock Newborn girls with severe CAH may have external genitals that are not clearly female or male. This is caused by high levels of male hormones. In newborn boys, the genitals usually appear normal, but sometimes the penis may be larger than usual. Classic CAH that is caused by a 21-hydroxylase deficiency can be diagnosed with 17-OHP testing. Less often, CAH is caused by a lack of a different enzyme. Nonclassic CAH includes mild forms of the disorder. It's also called late-onset CAH because symptoms show up between early childhood and early adulthood. It is almost always caused by a lack of 21-hydroxylase and can be found with a 17-OHP test. Treatment is only needed if a person has symptoms. The symptoms depend on the person's age and sex. For example: Children may have signs of early puberty, which means having signs of sexual development before age 8 in girls and before age 9 in boys. Teenage girls and women may have more facial and body hair than usual and/or a deep voice. Adults may have infertility. Other names: 17-OH progesterone, 17-OHP, 17 alphahydroxyprogesterone, 17 hydroxy progesterone: serum, progesterone: 17-hydroxy What is it used for? A 17-OHP test is used to help find and monitor the most common type of CAH, which is sometimes called 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The test is used to: Check all newborns for severe CAH (classic CAH). Newborn screening tests can't check for mild CAH (nonclassic). Help diagnose mild CAH in children, teens, and adults who have symptoms that could be caused by the disorder. Find out if treatment for CAH is working. Help rule out CAH in women who have certain symptoms such as large amounts of facial hair and irregular menstrual periods. These symptoms can also be caused by other conditions, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Why do I need a 17-OHP test? Babies need a 17-OHP test as part of routine newborn screening tests to check for severe CAH: If you give birth in a hospital , your baby will usually have a 17-OHP test before going home. The test is most accurate when it's done more than 24 hours after birth. If your baby is tested sooner, ask your child's provider if a second test should be done at a later time. Some states require two tests for all babies. If you give birth at home, make sure your baby has all the necessary screening tests. Symptoms of severe CAH usually begin within days or weeks after birth, but in certain cases, they may not show up until early childhood. These symptoms may be serious and include: Lack of energy Vomiting and other feeding problems Diarrhea Dehydration Failure to thrive (not gaining weight and growing as expected) Children, teens, and adults may need testing if they develop symptoms of mild CAH (nonclassic CAH): In children and teens, symptoms of mild CAH may include: Rapid growth that stops at a younger age than usual. As a result, older teens and adults with CAH may be shorter than average. Signs of early puberty. Severe acne, which may continue into adulthood. In girls and women, symptoms of mild CAH may include: More facial and/or body hair than usual Irregular menstrual periods or no periods at all Thinning hair on the head, especially near the temples (male pattern baldness) Enlarged clitoris Infertility In boys and men, symptoms of mild CAH may include: Enlarged penis with small testicles (testes) Low sperm count Infertility What happens during a 17-OHP test? For a newborn screening, a health care professional will clean your baby's heel with alcohol. Then the provider will stick the baby's heel with a small needle to collect a few drops of blood. The heel will then be bandaged. For older children and adults, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? There are no special preparations needed for a 17-OHP test. Are there any risks to the test? There is very little risk from a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. Your baby may feel a little pinch when the heel is poked. A small bruise may form on the heel, but it should go away quickly. What do the results mean? The results of a 17-OHP test help show whether you or your child have the most common type of CAH, which is caused by a lack of 21-hydroxylase. If test results show a normal amount of 17-OHP, it means that you or your child probably do not have CAH with 21-hydroxylase deficiency. If you or your child has symptoms, the provider may order other tests to figure out the cause. If test results show higher than normal levels of 17-OHP, you or your child probably has CAH. The provider may order other tests to learn more about how CAH is affecting you or your child. If you or your child is being treated for CAH, decreasing levels of 17-OHP over time means that the treatment is working. Treatment for CAH may include medicines to replace the cortisol your body can't make. Other medicines may also be needed, depending on the type of CAH. If a girl is born with atypical external genitals, surgery may also be done. If you, your child, or another family member has been diagnosed with CAH, you may want to talk with a genetic counselor. Genetic counselors are trained in genetics and genetic testing. They can help you learn how likely you are to pass CAH to future children. If you have questions about the results of a 17-OHP test, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results. Is there anything else I need to know about a 17-OHP test? If the results of your 17-OHP test aren't clear, your provider may order another test to measure your 17-OHP. This is called an ACTH stimulation test. It involves measuring your cortisol and 17-OHP levels before and after you have an injection (shot) of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone). ACTH is a hormone your body makes to trigger your adrenal glands to make cortisol. If you have CAH, the ACTH injection will make your 17-OHP levels increase a lot, but it will not increase your cortisol levels. Show references What is a 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) test?

  "6718102118061460192": "17-OH progesterone 17-OH progesterone is a blood test that measures the amount of 17-OH progesterone in the blood. This is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands and sex glands. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed. Most of the time, blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. In infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin. The blood collects in a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip. A bandage is put over the spot to stop any bleeding. How to Prepare for the Test Many medicines can interfere with blood test results. Your health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test. Do not stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first. How the Test will Feel You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn. Why the Test is Performed The main use of this test is to check infants for an inherited disorder that affects the adrenal gland, called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). It is often done on infants who are born with outer genitals that do not clearly look like those of a boy or a girl. This test is also used to identify people who develop symptoms of CAH later in life, a condition called nonclassical adrenal hyperplasia. A provider may recommend this test for women or girls who have male traits such as: Excess hair growth in places where adult men grow hair Deep voice or an increase in muscle mass Absence of menses Infertility Normal Results Normal and abnormal values differ for babies born with low birth weight. In general, normal results are as follows: Babies more than 24 hours old - less than 400 to 600 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL) or 12.12 to 18.18 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L) Children before puberty around 100 ng/dL or 3.03 nmol/L Adults - less than 200 ng/dL or 6.06 nmol/L Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. The examples above show the common measurements for results of these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens. What Abnormal Results Mean A high level of 17-OH progesterone may be due to: Tumors of the adrenal gland Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) In infants with CAH, the 17-OHP level ranges from 2,000 to 40,000 ng/dL or 60.6 to 1212 nmol/L. In adults, a level greater than 200 ng/dL or 6.06 nmol/L may be due to nonclassical adrenal hyperplasia. Considerations Your provider may suggest an ACTH test if 17-OH progesterone level is between 200 to 800 ng/dL or 6.06 to 24.24 nmol/L.

  "-8499627414379109084": "17-hydroxycorticosteroids urine test The 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (17-OHCS) test measures the level of 17-OHCS in the urine. How the Test is Performed A 24-hour urine sample is needed. You will need to collect your urine over 24 hours. Your health care provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly. How to Prepare for the Test Your provider will instruct you, if necessary, to stop medicines that may interfere with the test. These may include: Birth control pills that contain estrogen Certain antibiotics Glucocorticoids How the Test will Feel The test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort. Why the Test is Performed 17-OHCS is a product formed when the liver and other body tissues break down the steroid hormone cortisol. This test can help determine if the body is producing too much cortisol. The test may be used to diagnose Cushing syndrome. This is a disorder that occurs when the body has a constant high level of cortisol. The urine volume and urine creatinine are often done with 17-OHCS test at the same time. This helps the provider interpret the test. This test is not done often now. The free cortisol urine test is a better screening test for Cushing disease. Normal Results Normal values: Male: 3 to 9 mg/24 hours (8.3 to 25 µmol/24 hours) Female: 2 to 8 mg/24 hours (5.5 to 22 µmol/24 hours) Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean A higher than normal level of 17-OHCS may indicate: A type of Cushing syndrome caused by a tumor in the adrenal gland that produces cortisol Depression Hydrocortisone therapy Malnutrition Obesity Pregnancy A hormonal cause of severe high blood pressure Severe physical or emotional stress Tumor in the pituitary gland or elsewhere in the body that releases a hormone called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) A lower than normal level of 17-OHCS may indicate: Adrenal glands are not producing enough of their hormones Pituitary gland is not producing enough of its hormones Hereditary enzyme deficiency Previous surgery to remove the adrenal gland An expected result if part of a standard three- day dexamethasone suppression test Urinating more than 3 liters a day (polyuria) can make the result of the test high even though cortisol production is normal. Risks There are no risks with this test. Alternative Names 17-OH corticosteroids; 17-OHCS References Newell-Price JDC, Auchus RJ. The adrenal cortex.

The adrenal glands are located on top of the kidneys and produce a variety of hormones that regulate many essential functions in the body. In people with 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the adrenal glands produce excess androgens, which are male sex hormones. There are three types of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Two types are classic forms, known as the salt-wasting and simple virilizing types. The third type is called the non-classic type. The salt-wasting type is the most severe, the simple virilizing type is less severe, and the non-classic type is the least severe form. Males and females with either classic form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency tend to have an early growth spurt, but their final adult height is usually shorter than others in their family. Additionally, affected individuals may have a reduced ability to have biological children (decreased fertility). Females may also develop excessive body hair growth (hirsutism), male pattern baldness, and irregular menstruation. Approximately 75 percent of individuals with classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency have the salt-wasting type. Hormone production is extremely low in this form of the disorder. Affected individuals lose large amounts of sodium in their urine, which can be life-threatening in early infancy. Babies with the salt-wasting type can experience poor feeding, weight loss, dehydration, and vomiting. Individuals with the simple virilizing form do not experience salt loss. In both the salt-wasting and simple virilizing forms of this disorder, females typically have external genitalia that do not look clearly male or female. Males usually have male-typical genitalia but the testes may be small. Females with the non-classic type of 21-hydroxylase deficiency have female-typical genitalia. As affected females get older, they may experience hirsutism, male pattern baldness, irregular menstruation, and decreased fertility. Males with the non-classic type may have early beard growth and small testes. Some individuals with this type of 21-hydroxylase deficiency have no symptoms of the disorder.

Causes Expand Section Causes Expand Section Causes Expand Section Mutations in the CYP21A2 gene cause 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The CYP21A2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase. This enzyme is found in the adrenal glands, where it plays a role in producing hormones called cortisol and aldosterone. Cortisol has numerous functions, such as maintaining blood sugar (glucose) levels, protecting the body from stress, and suppressing inflammation. Aldosterone is sometimes called the salt-retaining hormone because it regulates the amount of salt retained by the kidneys. The retention of salt affects fluid levels in the body and blood pressure.21-hydroxylase deficiency is caused by a shortage (deficiency) of the 21-hydroxylase enzyme. When 21-hydroxylase is lacking, substances that are usually used to form cortisol and aldosterone instead build up in the adrenal glands\n\n---\n\nis found in the adrenal glands, where it plays a role in producing hormones called cortisol and aldosterone.

The retention of salt affects fluid levels in the body and blood pressure.21-hydroxylase deficiency is caused by a shortage (deficiency) of the 21-hydroxylase enzyme. When 21-hydroxylase is lacking, substances that are usually used to form cortisol and aldosterone instead build up in the adrenal glands and are converted to androgens. The excess production of androgens leads to abnormalities of sexual development in people with 21-hydroxylase deficiency. A lack of aldosterone production contributes to the salt loss in people with the salt-wasting form of this condition.The amount of functional 21-hydroxylase enzyme determines the severity of the disorder. Individuals with the salt-wasting type have CYP21A2 mutations that result in a completely nonfunctional enzyme. People with the simple virilizing type of this condition have CYP21A2 gene mutations that allow the production of low levels of functional enzyme. Individuals with the non-classic type of this disorder have CYP21A2 mutations that result in the production of reduced amounts of the enzyme, but more enzyme than either of the other types.

Submucosal cleft palate can also interfere with normal speech by causing air to come out of the nose during speech, leading to nasal-sounding speech. Affected individuals may also have breathing problems, kidney abnormalities, low levels of calcium in the blood (which can result in seizures), a decrease in blood platelets (thrombocytopenia), significant feeding difficulties, gastrointestinal problems, and hearing loss. Skeletal differences are possible, including mild short stature and, less frequently, abnormalities of the spinal bones. Many children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome have developmental delays, including delayed growth and speech development, and some have mild intellectual disability or learning disabilities. Older affected individuals have difficulty reading, performing tasks involving math, and problem solving. Children with this condition often need help changing and adapting their behaviors when responding to situations. Additionally, affected children are more likely than children without 22q11.2 deletion syndrome to have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and developmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorder that affect communication and social interaction. Because the signs and symptoms of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are so varied, different groupings of features were once described as separate conditions. Doctors named these conditions DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome (also called Shprintzen syndrome), and conotruncal anomaly face syndrome. In addition, some children with the 22q11.2 deletion were diagnosed with the autosomal dominant form of Opitz G/BBB syndrome and Cayler cardiofacial syndrome. Once the genetic basis for these disorders was identified, doctors determined that they were all part of a single syndrome with many possible signs and symptoms. To avoid confusion, this condition is usually called 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, a description based on its underlying genetic cause.

However, the condition may actually be more common than this estimate because doctors and researchers suspect it is underdiagnosed due to its variable features.

Causes Expand Section Causes Expand Section Causes Expand Section Most people with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are missing a sequence of about 3 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) on one copy of chromosome 22 in each cell. This region contains 30 to 40 genes, many of which have not been well characterized. A small percentage of affected individuals have shorter deletions in the same region. This condition is described as a contiguous gene deletion syndrome because it results from the loss of many genes that are close together.Researchers are working to identify all of the genes that contribute to the features of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. They have determined that the loss of a particular gene on chromosome 22, TBX1, is probably responsible for many of the syndrome's characteristic signs (such as heart defects, a cleft palate, distinctive facial features, hearing loss, and low calcium levels). Some studies suggest that a deletion of this gene may contribute to behavioral problems as well. The loss of another gene, COMT, in the same region of chromosome 22 may also help explain the increased risk of behavioral problems and mental illness. The loss of additional genes in the deleted region likely contributes to the varied features of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.

For most people with overweight, cutting about 500 calories a day is a good place to start. If you can eat 500 fewer calories every day, you should lose about a pound (454 g) a week.\n\nAlways talk with your health care provider to determine a healthy weight for you before starting a weight-loss diet.\n\n**How to Cut Calories**\n\nTry these 10 ways to cut 500 calories every day. It is easier than you may think.\n\n* **Swap Your Snack**: Many people reach for a snack or two in between meals. Snacking is fine as long as you choose options that will fill up with fewer calories. The key is to have some healthy snacks ready when hunger hits.\n\t+ Instead of a 3-ounce (85 g) bag of flavored tortilla chips (425 calories), choose a cup (240 mL) of air-popped popcorn (31 calories), a cup (240 mL) of grapes and a low-fat cheese stick or a small apple and 12 almonds (80 calories).\n* **Cut One High-Calorie Treat**: Try to remove one high-calorie food item each day. Whether it is a donut in the morning, a brownie or bag of chips at lunch, or chocolate cake after dinner, you will save 250 to 350 calories or more.\n\t+ To burn another 150 calories, take a 40-minute brisk walk after lunch or dinner.\n* **Do Not Drink Your Calories**: One 12-ounce (355 mL) regular soda has about 150 calories, and a 16-ounce (475 mL) flavored latte can pack 250 calories or more. Even fruit smoothies have lots of calories, as many as 400 in a 16-ounce (475 mL) serving.\n\t+ Choose water, plain or flavored, sparkling water, or black coffee or tea instead and save your calories for foods that will help you feel full.\n* **Skip Seconds**: Taking a second helping can add up to unwanted calories. It is easy to keep filling your plate when you serve food family style on the table.\n\t+ Instead, fill your plate once and keep extras in the kitchen. Or, if you still do not feel satisfied, add a second helping of vegetables, fruit, or salad.\n* **Make Low Calorie Substitutions**: Substitute lower-calorie options for some of your high-calorie favorites.\n\t+ For example, if a recipe calls for a cup (240 mL) of sour cream (455 calories), use a cup (240 mL) of plain low-fat yogurt or Greek yogurt instead (220 calories).\n* **Ask for a Doggie Bag**: The portions at many restaurants are much larger than recommended serving sizes.\n\t+ Instead of cleaning your whole plate, ask the server to put half in a container for you to take home for another meal. You can also share an entrée with a friend, or make a meal out of an appetizer and a large salad.\n* **Just Say \"No\" to Fried Food**: Frying food can add lots of unhealthy calories and saturated fat to any dish.\n\t+ Instead of fried chicken or fish, choose grilled, broiled, or poached instead. And skip the French fries. A large serving of fries alone can add almost 500 calories to a meal.\n* **Build a Thinner Pizza**: Skip the meat toppings, extra cheese, and deep-dish crust, and have a couple slices of thin-crust vegetable pizza instead.\n\t+ You will save a little over 500 calories.\n* **Use a Plate**: Eat all food from a plate or bowl, including snacks. When you snack out of a bag or box, it is easy to eat more than you intend to.\n\t+ This is especially true if you are sitting in front of the TV. You may be surprised to learn that a large bag of chips could be more than 1000 calories.\n* **Avoid Alcohol**: Cutting back on alcohol is an easy way for many people to trim calories.\n\t+ Alcohol does not have any nutritional value, so when you imbibe (drink) alcohol, you are getting empty calories, up to 500 for some mixed drinks made with syrupy sweeteners, fruit juices, and ice cream or heavy cream.\n\n**References**\n\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.

  "903b5bf9d3f31dc4e5f92a78faca3b10": "**10q26 Deletion Syndrome**\n\n**Description**\n\n10q26 deletion syndrome is a condition that results from the loss (deletion) of a small piece of chromosome 10 in each cell. The deletion occurs on the long (q) arm of the chromosome at a position designated 10q26.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of 10q26 deletion syndrome vary widely, even among affected members of the same family. Among the more common features associated with this chromosomal change are distinctive facial features, mild to moderate intellectual disability, growth problems, and developmental delay. People with 10q26 deletion syndrome often have delayed development of speech and of motor skills such as sitting, crawling, and walking. Some have limited speech throughout life. Affected individuals may experience seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), poor impulse control (impulsivity), or exhibit autistic behaviors that affect communication and social interaction.\n\n**Common Features**\n\n* Distinctive facial features\n* Mild to moderate intellectual disability\n* Growth problems\n* Developmental delay\n* Delayed development of speech and motor skills\n* Limited speech throughout life\n* Seizures\n* Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n* Poor impulse control (impulsivity)\n* Autistic behaviors\n\n**Facial Features**\n\n* Prominent or beaked nose\n* Broad nasal bridge\n* Small jaw (micrognathia)\n* Malformed ears that are low set\n* Thin upper lip\n* Unusually small head size (microcephaly)\n* Widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism) that do not look in the same direction (strabismus)\n* Short neck with extra folds of skin (webbed neck)\n\n**Less Common Signs and Symptoms**\n\n* Skeletal problems:\n\t+ Spine that curves to the side (scoliosis)\n\t+ Limited movement in the elbows or other joints\n\t+ Curved fifth fingers and toes (clinodactyly)\n* Slow growth before and after birth\n* Genital abnormalities in males:\n\t+ Small penis (micropenis)\n\t+ Undescended testes (cryptorchidism)\n\t+ Urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias)\n* Kidney abnormalities\n* Heart defects\n* Breathing problems\n* Recurrent infections\n* Hearing or vision problems\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of 10q26 deletion syndrome is not known. It is a genetic disorder that occurs when there is a loss of a small piece of chromosome 10 in each cell.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition can occur in people with no family history of the disorder. It is usually a random event during cell division.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* 10q26 deletion syndrome\n* Chromosome 10q26 deletion\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information about this condition, you may want to contact:\n\n* National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n* American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)\n\n**References**\n\nThis information is based on the MedlinePlus Genetics entry for 10q26 deletion syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**10q26 Deletion Syndrome**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**What are the signs and symptoms of 10q26 deletion syndrome?**\n\n* Individuals may experience seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), poor impulse control (impulsivity), or exhibit autistic behaviors that affect communication and social interaction.\n* A range of facial features is seen in people with 10q26 deletion syndrome, but not all affected individuals have these features. These features may include:\n\t+ A prominent or beaked nose\n\t+ A broad nasal bridge\n\t+ A small jaw (micrognathia)\n\t+ Malformed ears that are low set\n\t+ A thin upper lip\n\t+ An unusually small head size (microcephaly)\n* Many affected individuals have widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism) that do not look in the same direction (strabismus).\n* Some people with this condition have a short neck with extra folds of skin (webbed neck).\n\n**Less common signs and symptoms**\n\n* Skeletal problems, including:\n\t+ A spine that curves to the side (scoliosis)\n\t+ Limited movement in the elbows or other joints\n\t+ Curved fifth fingers and toes (clinodactyly)\n* Slow growth before and after birth\n* Males with this condition may have genital abnormalities, such as:\n\t+ A small penis (micropenis)\n\t+ Undescended testes (cryptorchidism)\n\t+ The urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias)\n* Some people with 10q26 deletion syndrome have kidney abnormalities, heart defects, breathing problems, recurrent infections, or hearing or vision problems.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n10q26 deletion syndrome is thought to be a rare condition; at least 100 cases have been described in the scientific literature.\n\n**Causes**\n\nPeople with a 10q26 deletion syndrome are missing between 3.5 million and 17 million DNA building blocks (base pairs), also written as 3.5-17 megabases (Mb), at position q26 on chromosome 10. The exact size of the deletion varies, and it is unclear what exact region needs to be deleted to cause the condition.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered chromosome in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. This condition may be inherited or occur as a result of a new chromosomal change. In some cases, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a deleted segment from a parent. Other cases result from a deletion that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) in an affected individual's parent or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\n**Learn more about the chromosome associated with 10q26 deletion syndrome**\n\n* Learn more about chromosome 10\n\n---\n\n**10q26 Deletion Syndrome**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**What is 10q26 Deletion Syndrome?**\n\n*   This condition is caused by the deletion of a segment from chromosome 10.\n*   It can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning one copy of the altered chromosome in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n*   In some cases, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a deleted segment from a parent.

The deletion occurs near the middle of the chromosome at a location designated p11.2.\n\nPeople with 16p11.2 deletion syndrome usually have developmental delay and intellectual disability. Most also have at least some features of autism spectrum disorders. These disorders are characterized by impaired communication and socialization skills, as well as delayed development of speech and language. In 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, expressive language skills (vocabulary and the production of speech) are generally more severely affected than receptive language skills (the ability to understand speech). Some people with this disorder have recurrent seizures (epilepsy).\n\nSome affected individuals have minor physical abnormalities such as low-set ears or partially webbed toes (partial syndactyly). People with this disorder are also at increased risk of obesity compared with the general population. However, there is no particular pattern of physical abnormalities that characterizes 16p11.2 deletion syndrome. Signs and symptoms of the disorder vary even among affected members of the same family. Some people with the deletion have no identified physical, intellectual, or behavioral abnormalities.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThe prevalence of this deletion in the general population is difficult to determine but has been estimated at approximately 3 in 10,000. Most people tested for the 16p11.2 deletion have come to medical attention as a result of developmental delay or autistic characteristics. Other individuals with the 16p11.2 deletion have no associated health or behavioral problems, and so the deletion may never be detected.\n\n**Causes**\n\n* The exact cause of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome is not known.\n* It is believed to occur randomly for unknown reasons.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n* This condition is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning a single copy of the deleted chromosome 16 is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n* However, some cases may be caused by new mutations in people with no family history of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* None\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* More information about this condition can be obtained from MedlinePlus Genetics and other reliable sources.\n\n**References**\n\n* (List of references will be provided upon request)\n\n**Related Conditions**\n\n* Autism spectrum disorders\n* Intellectual disability\n* Developmental delay\n* Epilepsy\n\n---\n\n**16p11.2 Deletion Syndrome**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Prevalence**\n----------------\n\nThe prevalence of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome is difficult to determine, but it has been estimated at approximately 3 in 10,000.\n\n**Causes**\n----------\n\nPeople with 16p11.2 deletion syndrome are missing a sequence of about 600,000 DNA building blocks (base pairs), also written as 600 kilobases (kb), at position p11.2 on chromosome 16. This deletion affects one of the two copies of chromosome 16 in each cell. The 600 kb region contains more than 25 genes, and in many cases little is known about their function.\n\n**Inheritance**\n--------------\n\n16p11.2 deletion syndrome is considered to have an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern because a deletion in one copy of chromosome 16 in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. However, most cases of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome are not inherited. The deletion occurs most often as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n---------------------------------\n\n* Autism, susceptibility to, 14A AUTS14A\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n--------------------------------------\n\n### Genetic Testing Information\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Proximal 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: Proximal 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome\n\n### Patient Support and Advocacy Resources\n\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n### Clinical Trials\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n### Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n\n*   CHROMOSOME 16p11.2 DELETION SYNDROME, 593-KB\n\n### Scientific Articles on PubMed\n\n*   PubMed\n\n**References**\n--------------\n\n1.

This deletion can lead to various physical and developmental abnormalities, including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and other medical conditions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome is not fully understood, but it is believed to be a result of a microdeletion at the 16p11.2 locus on chromosome 16. This deletion can occur spontaneously or be inherited from a parent.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms and Characteristics**\n\nThe symptoms and characteristics of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome can vary widely among affected individuals, but may include:\n\n* Intellectual disability\n* Autism spectrum disorder\n* Speech and language delays\n* Developmental delays\n* Physical abnormalities, such as hemivertebrae or aortic valve problems\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Genetics**\n\nThe genetics of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome are complex and not fully understood. However, it is believed that the microdeletion at the 16p11.2 locus on chromosome 16 is responsible for the development of this condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation, medical history, and genetic testing. Genetic testing can confirm the presence of the microdeletion at the 16p11.2 locus on chromosome 16.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, but various treatments and management strategies can help alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. These may include:\n\n* Speech and language therapy\n* Occupational therapy\n* Physical therapy\n* Medications to manage associated medical conditions\n* Educational support\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with 16p11.2 deletion syndrome varies widely depending on the severity of symptoms and the effectiveness of treatment. Some individuals may experience significant developmental delays or intellectual disability, while others may have milder symptoms.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Autism Spectrum Disorder\n* Developmental Disabilities\n* Genetic Disorders\n* Speech and Communication Disorders\n\n---\n\n**16p11.2 Deletion Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\n\n**What is 16p11.2 deletion syndrome?**\n \nThis condition is caused by a small missing piece of the short arm (p) of chromosome 16. The missing piece contains several genes that are involved in various bodily functions.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Can this condition be inherited?**\n\n* This condition can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n* In some cases, it may occur due to a new mutation in the family and not inherited from either parent.\n\n\\n\\n\n**How are genetic conditions treated or managed?**\n\n* Treatment for 16p11.2 deletion syndrome usually focuses on managing its associated symptoms and complications.\n* Early intervention with speech therapy, occupational therapy, and other forms of support can help improve developmental outcomes.\n* In some cases, medications may be prescribed to manage specific symptoms such as anxiety or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\n\\n\\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* *Autism Spectrum Disorder*\n* *Developmental Disabilities*\n* *Genetic Disorders*\n* *Speech and Communication Disorders*\n\n\\n\\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n* **What is the prognosis of a genetic condition?**\n  The prognosis for a genetic condition depends on its specific cause, severity, and associated symptoms.\n* **How can gene variants affect health and development?**\n  Gene variants can affect various bodily functions, including growth and development, metabolism, and organ function.\n* **What does it mean if a disorder seems to run in my family?**\n  If a disorder seems to run in your family, it may indicate a genetic component.\n* **What are the different ways a genetic condition can be inherited?**\n  Genetic conditions can be inherited in various patterns, including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked.\n\n\\n\\n\n**The information on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.

The gonads direct sexual development before birth and during puberty and are important for reproduction. The adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys, regulate the production of certain hormones, including those that control salt levels in the body. People with 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency have an imbalance of many of the hormones that are made in these glands. 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency is one of a group of disorders, known as congenital adrenal hyperplasias, that impair hormone production and disrupt sexual development and maturation.\n\n**Hormone Imbalances**\n\nHormone imbalances lead to the characteristic signs and symptoms of 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency, which include:\n\n* High blood pressure (hypertension)\n* Low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia)\n* Abnormal sexual development\n\nThe severity of the features varies. Two forms of the condition are recognized: complete 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency, which is more severe, and partial 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency, which is typically less so.\n\n**Sexual Development**\n\nMales and females are affected by disruptions to sexual development differently.\n\n* Females (who have two X chromosomes) with 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency:\n\t+ Are born with normal external female genitalia\n\t+ May have underdeveloped internal reproductive organs\n\t+ Do not develop secondary sex characteristics or menstruate (amenorrhea)\n* Males (who have an X and a Y chromosome) with 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency:\n\t+ May have abnormalities of the external genitalia\n\t+ Have testes that are abnormally located in the abdomen (undescended)\n\t+ Do not develop male secondary sex characteristics or are infertile\n\n**Forms of the Condition**\n\nTwo forms of 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency are recognized:\n\n* Complete 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency: more severe\n* Partial 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency: typically less severe\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThe inheritance pattern of 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency is not well understood.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Congenital adrenal hyperplasia\n* 17 alpha(α)-hydroxylase deficiency\n* 17,20-lyase deficiency\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nThis section will be updated with additional information and resources as needed.\n\n**References**\n\nThis section will be updated with references to relevant studies and articles.\n\n---\n\n**17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency**\n\n**What is 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency?**\n\n17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency is a condition that affects the function of certain hormone-producing glands called the gonads (ovaries in females and testes in males) and the adrenal glands.

The protein produced from this gene is involved in the formation of steroid hormones. This group of hormones includes sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen, which are needed for normal sexual development and reproduction; mineralocorticoids, which help regulate the body's salt and water balance; and glucocorticoids, which are involved in maintaining blood sugar (glucose) levels and regulating the body's response to stress.\n\nSteroid hormones are produced through a series of chemical reactions. The CYP17A1 enzyme performs two important reactions in this process:\n\n* 17 alpha(α)-hydroxylase activity, which is important for production of glucocorticoids and sex hormones.\n* 17,20-lyase activity, which is integral to the production of sex hormones.\n\n17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency results from a shortage (deficiency) of both enzyme activities. The amount of remaining enzyme activity determines whether a person will have the complete or partial form of the disorder.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means:\n\n* Both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.\n* The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMales with 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency may experience:\n\n* A small penis (micropenis)\n* The opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis (hypospadias)\n* A scrotum divided into two lobes (bifid scrotum)\n\nMales and females with 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency may experience:\n\n* Infertility\n* Disrupted development of the reproductive system\n* Impaired onset of puberty\n\n---\n\n**17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency**\n\n**Category:** diseases\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.

They make different types of hormones you need to stay alive and healthy. Hormones are chemical messengers in your bloodstream that control the actions of certain cells or organs.\n\n**17-OHP Test and Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)**\n\nA 17-OHP test helps diagnose a group of uncommon, inherited genetic disorders that affect how well your adrenal glands make cortisol. These genetic adrenal gland disorders are called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). People with CAH have a change in a gene that causes the lack of an enzyme that your adrenal glands need to make hormones.\n\n**Symptoms of CAH**\n\nThe symptoms of CAH depend on how much cortisol the adrenal glands are able to make. CAH is often organized into two groups based on how severe the symptoms are:\n\n*   **Classic CAH**: The most severe forms of the disorder, usually diagnosed at birth.\n    *   Symptoms may include:\n        *   Dehydration\n        *   Low blood pressure\n        *   An irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)\n        *   Shock\n        *   Newborn girls with severe CAH may have external genitals that are not clearly female or male. In newborn boys, the genitals usually appear normal, but sometimes the penis may be larger than usual.\n*   **Nonclassic CAH**: Mild forms of the disorder, also called late-onset CAH because symptoms show up between early childhood and early adulthood.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nA 17-OHP test is used to help find and monitor the most common type of CAH, which is sometimes called 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The test is used to:\n\n*   Check all newborns for severe CAH (classic CAH). Newborn screening tests can't check for mild CAH (nonclassic).\n*   Help diagnose mild CAH in children, teens, and adults who have symptoms that could be caused by the disorder.\n*   Find out if treatment for CAH is working.\n*   Help rule out CAH in women who have certain symptoms such as large amounts of facial hair and irregular menstrual periods.\n\n**Why do I need a 17-OHP test?**\n\nBabies need a 17-OHP test as part of routine newborn screening tests to check for severe CAH. Children, teens, and adults may need testing if they develop symptoms of mild CAH (nonclassic CAH).\n\n**What happens during a 17-OHP test?**\n\nFor a newborn screening, a health care professional will clean your baby's heel with alcohol. Then the provider will stick the baby's heel with a small needle to collect a few drops of blood. The heel will then be bandaged.\n\nFor older children and adults, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nThere are no special preparations needed for a 17-OHP test.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk from a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. Your baby may feel a little pinch when the heel is poked. A small bruise may form on the heel, but it should go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nThe results of a 17-OHP test help show whether you or your child have the most common type of CAH, which is caused by a lack of 21-hydroxylase. If test results show a normal amount of 17-OHP, it means that you or your child probably do not have CAH with 21-hydroxylase deficiency.\n\n---\n\n**What is a 17-Hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) Test?**\n\nA 17-OHP test measures the amount of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) in a sample of your blood. 17-OHP is a substance that your adrenal glands make.\n\nYour adrenal glands are two small organs that sit on top of each kidney. They make different types of hormones you need to stay alive and healthy. Hormones are chemical messengers in your bloodstream that control the actions of certain cells or organs.\n\nNormally, your adrenal glands use 17-OHP to make a hormone called cortisol. Cortisol helps control your energy levels, blood glucose (sugar), blood pressure, and your body's response to stress, illness and injury.\n\n**What is Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)?**\n\nA 17-OHP test helps diagnose a group of uncommon, inherited genetic disorders that affect how well your adrenal glands make cortisol. These genetic adrenal gland disorders are called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).\n\nPeople with CAH have a change in a gene that causes the lack of an enzyme that your adrenal glands need to make hormones. The most common type of CAH is caused by a lack of an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase. 21-hydroxylase helps your adrenal glands use 17-OHP to make cortisol.\n\n**Symptoms of CAH**\n\nThe symptoms of CAH depend on how much cortisol the adrenal glands are able to make. CAH is often organized into two groups based on how severe the symptoms are:\n\n* **Classic CAH**: includes the most severe forms of the disorder. It's usually diagnosed at birth. Without diagnosis and treatment, severe CAH can be life-threatening.\n\t+ Newborn girls with severe CAH may have external genitals that are not clearly female or male.\n\t+ In newborn boys, the genitals usually appear normal, but sometimes the penis may be larger than usual.\n* **Nonclassic CAH**: includes mild forms of the disorder. It's also called late-onset CAH because symptoms show up between early childhood and early adulthood.\n\n**What is a 17-OHP Test Used For?**\n\nA 17-OHP test is used to help find and monitor the most common type of CAH, which is sometimes called 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

These symptoms may be serious and include:\n\t+ Lack of energy\n\t+ Vomiting and other feeding problems\n\t+ Diarrhea\n\t+ Dehydration\n\t+ Failure to thrive (not gaining weight and growing as expected)\n* Children, teens, and adults may need testing if they develop symptoms of mild CAH (nonclassic CAH), which include:\n\t+ Rapid growth that stops at a younger age than usual\n\t+ Signs of early puberty\n\t+ Severe acne, which may continue into adulthood\n\t+ More facial and/or body hair than usual\n\t+ Irregular menstrual periods or no periods at all\n\t+ Thinning hair on the head, especially near the temples (male pattern baldness)\n\t+ Enlarged clitoris\n\t+ Infertility\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Happens During a 17-OHP Test?**\n\n* For a newborn screening, a health care professional will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and then stick the baby's heel with a small needle to collect a few drops of blood.

If you or your child has symptoms, the provider may order other tests to figure out the cause.\n* If test results show higher than normal levels of 17-OHP, you or your child probably has CAH. The provider may order other tests to learn more about how CAH is affecting you or your child.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About a 17-OHP Test?**\n\n* If the results of your 17-OHP test aren't clear, your provider may order another test to measure your 17-OHP. This is called an ACTH stimulation test.\n* An ACTH stimulation test involves measuring your cortisol and 17-OHP levels before and after you have an injection (shot) of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone).\n* If you have CAH, the ACTH injection will make your 17-OHP levels increase a lot, but it will not increase your cortisol levels.\n\n---\n\n**17-Hydroxyprogesterone: MedlinePlus Medical Test**\n\n**What is 17-Hydroxyprogesterone?**\n\n17-Hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands. It plays a crucial role in triggering the production of cortisol, another important hormone.\n\n**How is 17-Hydroxyprogesterone related to Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)?**\n\nIn individuals with CAH, the body's ability to produce cortisol is impaired. As a result, the adrenal glands produce more 17-OHP in an attempt to compensate for the lack of cortisol.\n\n**Testing for 17-Hydroxyprogesterone**\n\nA blood test can be used to measure the levels of 17-OHP in the blood. This test is often performed on newborns as part of routine screening tests.\n\n* **Why is this test important?**\n\t+ It helps diagnose Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) and other adrenal gland disorders.\n\t+ It can help identify individuals with genetic disorders that affect hormone production.\n\n**What to Expect During the Test**\n\nThe 17-OHP blood test involves a simple blood draw from a vein in the arm. The results of the test will be used to determine if further testing or treatment is necessary.\n\n* **Interpreting Test Results**\n\t+ Normal levels of 17-OHP are typically between 20-100 ng/dL.\n\t+ Elevated levels may indicate CAH or other adrenal gland disorders.\n\n**References**\n\n* Allina Health.

The adrenal glands are located on top of the kidneys and produce a variety of hormones that regulate many essential functions in the body. In people with 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the adrenal glands produce excess androgens, which are male sex hormones.\n\nThere are three types of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Two types are classic forms, known as the salt-wasting and simple virilizing types. The third type is called the non-classic type. The salt-wasting type is the most severe, the simple virilizing type is less severe, and the non-classic type is the least severe form.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMales and females with either classic form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency tend to have an early growth spurt, but their final adult height is usually shorter than others in their family. Additionally, affected individuals may have a reduced ability to have biological children (decreased fertility). Females may also develop excessive body hair growth (hirsutism), male pattern baldness, and irregular menstruation.\n\n**Types of 21-hydroxylase Deficiency**\n\n* **Salt-wasting type**: This is the most severe form, accounting for approximately 75 percent of individuals with classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Hormone production is extremely low in this form of the disorder. Affected individuals lose large amounts of sodium in their urine, which can be life-threatening in early infancy.\n* **Simple virilizing type**: Individuals with this form do not experience salt loss. Females typically have external genitalia that do not look clearly male or female, while males usually have male-typical genitalia but the testes may be small.\n* **Non-classic type**: This is the least severe form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Females with this type have female-typical genitalia and may experience hirsutism, male pattern baldness, irregular menstruation, and decreased fertility as they get older. Males with this type may have early beard growth and small testes.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nApproximately 75 percent of individuals with classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency have the salt-wasting type.\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Inherited disorder that affects the adrenal glands\n* Excess production of androgens, which are male sex hormones\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n* This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Congenital adrenal hyperplasia\n* CAH\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* For more information about 21-hydroxylase deficiency, contact the following organizations:\n  * National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n  * American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM)\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: References are not provided in this cleaned output)\n\n---\n\n**What is 21-hydroxylase deficiency?**\n\n\\n\\n\n21-hydroxylase deficiency is an inherited disorder that affects the adrenal glands.

The severity of the disorder varies among these types:\n\n*   **Classic Salt-Wasting Type**: This is the most severe form, where hormone production is extremely low.\n*   **Classic Simple Virilizing Type**: This type is less severe than the salt-wasting type but more severe than the non-classic type.\n*   **Non-Classic Type**: This is the least severe form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n\\n\\n\nIndividuals with 21-hydroxylase deficiency may experience a range of symptoms, including:\n\n*   Reduced ability to have biological children (decreased fertility)\n*   Excessive body hair growth (hirsutism) in females\n*   Male pattern baldness and irregular menstruation in females\n*   Poor feeding, weight loss, dehydration, and vomiting in infants with the salt-wasting type\n*   Small testes in males\n\n**Frequency**\n\n\\n\\n\nThe classic forms of 21-hydroxylase deficiency occur in approximately 1 in 15,000 newborns. The prevalence of the non-classic form is estimated to be 1 in 1,000 individuals.\n\n**Causes**\n\n\\n\\n\nMutations in the CYP21A2 gene cause 21-hydroxylase deficiency. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase, which plays a role in producing hormones called cortisol and aldosterone.\n\n**Genetic Basis**\n\n\\n\\n\nThe amount of functional 21-hydroxylase enzyme determines the severity of the disorder:\n\n*   Individuals with the salt-wasting type have CYP21A2 mutations that result in a completely nonfunctional enzyme.\n*   People with the simple virilizing type of this condition have CYP21A2 gene mutations that allow the production of low levels of functional enzyme.\n*   Individuals with the non-classic type of this disorder have CYP21A2 mutations that result in the production of reduced amounts of the enzyme.\n\n---\n\n**21-hydroxylase deficiency**\n\n**Category:** diseases\n\n**What is 21-hydroxylase deficiency?**\n\n*   Individuals with the non-classic type of this disorder have CYP21A2 mutations that result in the production of reduced amounts of the enzyme, but more enzyme than either of the other types.\n\n**The Gene Associated with 21-hydroxylase Deficiency**\n\n*   The CYP21A2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase.\n*   This enzyme is found in the adrenal glands, where it plays a role in producing hormones called cortisol and aldosterone.\n*   Cortisol has numerous functions, such as maintaining blood sugar (glucose) levels, protecting the body from stress, and suppressing inflammation.\n*   Aldosterone is sometimes called the salt-retaining hormone because it regulates the amount of salt retained by the kidneys.\n\n**Causes of 21-hydroxylase Deficiency**\n\n*   A shortage (deficiency) of the 21-hydroxylase enzyme causes 21-hydroxylase deficiency.\n*   When 21-hydroxylase is lacking, substances that are usually used to form cortisol and aldosterone instead build up in the adrenal glands and are converted to androgens.\n*   The excess production of androgens leads to abnormalities of sexual development in people with 21-hydroxylase deficiency.\n\n**Types of 21-hydroxylase Deficiency**\n\n*   Individuals with the salt-wasting type have CYP21A2 mutations that result in a completely nonfunctional enzyme.\n*   People with the simple virilizing type of this condition have CYP21A2 gene mutations that allow the production of low levels of functional enzyme.\n*   Individuals with the non-classic type of this disorder have CYP21A2 mutations that result in the production of reduced amounts of the enzyme, but more enzyme than either of the other types.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n*   This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.\n*   The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n*   CAH1\n*   Congenital adrenal hyperplasia 1\n*   Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21 hydroxylase deficiency\n*   CYP21 deficiency\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Hyperandrogenism, nonclassic type, due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n\n---\n\n**21-hydroxylase deficiency**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n    *   ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA, CONGENITAL, DUE TO 21-HYDROXYLASE DEFICIENCY\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed\n    *   PubMed\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency\n*   Genetic Testing Registry: Hyperandrogenism, nonclassic type, due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency\n*   Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center\n    *   Classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency\n    *   Congenital adrenal hyperplasia\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n*   National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n*   Clinical Trials\n    *   ClinicalTrials.gov\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n    *   ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA, CONGENITAL, DUE TO 21-HYDROXYLASE DEFICIENCY\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed\n    *   PubMed\n\n**References**\n\n1.

The deletion occurs near the middle of the chromosome at a location designated q11.2.\n\nThis condition has many possible signs and symptoms that can affect almost any part of the body. The features of this syndrome vary widely, even among affected members of the same family. People with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome commonly have:\n\n* Heart abnormalities that are often present from birth\n* Recurrent infections caused by problems with the immune system\n* Distinctive facial features\n\nIn addition, individuals with this condition may experience:\n\n* Submucosal cleft palate (a condition where the muscles that form the roof of the mouth do not close completely)\n* Bifid uvula (a split in the soft flap of tissue that hangs from the back of the mouth)\n* Breathing problems\n* Kidney abnormalities\n* Low levels of calcium in the blood, which can result in seizures\n* Decrease in blood platelets (thrombocytopenia)\n* Significant feeding difficulties\n* Gastrointestinal problems\n* Hearing loss\n\nSkeletal differences are also possible, including:\n\n* Mild short stature\n* Abnormalities of the spinal bones\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThe frequency of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is not well established.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThis condition is caused by a deletion of a small piece of chromosome 22.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThe inheritance pattern of this condition is autosomal dominant, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* DiGeorge syndrome\n* Velocardiofacial syndrome (also called Shprintzen syndrome)\n* Conotruncal anomaly face syndrome\n* Opitz G/BBB syndrome (autosomal dominant form)\n* Cayler cardiofacial syndrome\n\n**Developmental Delays and Learning Disabilities**\n\nMany children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome have developmental delays, including:\n\n* Delayed growth and speech development\n* Mild intellectual disability or learning disabilities\n* Difficulty reading, performing tasks involving math, and problem solving\n\nChildren with this condition often need help changing and adapting their behaviors when responding to situations. Additionally, affected children are more likely than children without 22q11.2 deletion syndrome to have:\n\n* Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n* Developmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorder that affect communication and social interaction.\n\n**References**\n\nThis information is based on the MedlinePlus Genetics article on 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**What are the signs and symptoms of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome?**\n\n* Significant feeding difficulties\n* Gastrointestinal problems\n* Hearing loss\n* Skeletal differences, including mild short stature and abnormalities of the spinal bones\n\nMany children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome have developmental delays, including delayed growth and speech development, and some have mild intellectual disability or learning disabilities.\n\n**Common Features**\n\n* Heart abnormalities that are often present from birth\n* Recurrent infections caused by problems with the immune system\n* Distinctive facial features\n* Submucosal cleft palate (the muscles that form the roof of the mouth may not close completely)\n* Breathing problems\n* Kidney abnormalities\n* Low levels of calcium in the blood (which can result in seizures)\n* Decrease in blood platelets (thrombocytopenia)\n\n**Developmental Delays and Learning Disabilities**\n\n* Many children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome have developmental delays, including delayed growth and speech development\n* Some have mild intellectual disability or learning disabilities\n* Older affected individuals have difficulty reading, performing tasks involving math, and problem solving\n\n**Other Conditions**\n\n* Affected children are more likely than children without 22q11.2 deletion syndrome to have:\n\t+ Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n\t+ Autism spectrum disorder that affect communication and social interaction\n\n**History of the Condition**\n\nBecause the signs and symptoms of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are so varied, different groupings of features were once described as separate conditions.\n\n* DiGeorge syndrome\n* Velocardiofacial syndrome (also called Shprintzen syndrome)\n* Conotruncal anomaly face syndrome\n* Opitz G/BBB syndrome (autosomal dominant form)\n* Cayler cardiofacial syndrome\n\nOnce the genetic basis for these disorders was identified, doctors determined that they were all part of a single syndrome with many possible signs and symptoms.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n22q11.2 deletion syndrome affects an estimated 1 in 4,000 people. However, the condition may actually be more common than this estimate because doctors and researchers suspect it is underdiagnosed due to its variable features.\n\n---\n\n**22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome**\n\n**What is 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome?**\n\n22q11.2 deletion syndrome affects an estimated 1 in 4,000 people. However, the condition may actually be more common than this estimate because doctors and researchers suspect it is underdiagnosed due to its variable features. The condition may not be identified in people with mild signs and symptoms, or it may be mistaken for other disorders with overlapping features.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe causes of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are related to a missing sequence of about 3 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) on one copy of chromosome 22 in each cell. This region contains 30 to 40 genes, many of which have not been well characterized.\n\n* Most people with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are missing a sequence of about 3 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) on one copy of chromosome 22 in each cell.\n* A small percentage of affected individuals have shorter deletions in the same region.\n* Researchers are working to identify all of the genes that contribute to the features of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.\n\nThe loss of a particular gene on chromosome 22, TBX1, is probably responsible for many of the syndrome's characteristic signs (such as heart defects, a cleft palate, distinctive facial features, hearing loss, and low calcium levels). Some studies suggest that a deletion of this gene may contribute to behavioral problems as well. The loss of another gene, COMT, in the same region of chromosome 22 may also help explain the increased risk of behavioral problems and mental illness.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Learn More**\n\n* Learn more about the genes and chromosome associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome:\n\t+ **COMT**\n\t+ **TBX1**\n\t+ **chromosome 22**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThe inheritance of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is considered autosomal dominant because a deletion in one copy of chromosome 22 in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition.\n\n* Most cases of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are not inherited, however.\n* The deletion occurs most often as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development.\n* Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family, though they can pass the condition to their children.\n* In about 10 percent of cases, a person with this condition inherits the deletion in chromosome 22 from a parent.\n\n---\n\n**22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome**\n\n**What is 22q11.2 deletion syndrome?**\n\nPeople with this condition may have heart problems, such as a hole in the wall between the two sides of the heart or an abnormality of the aorta.

It's used to diagnose and monitor conditions related to vitamin D deficiency or excess.\n\n**Understanding Your Results**\n\n* The normal range for 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels is measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) or nanomoles/liter (nmol/L).\n* Many experts recommend a level from 20-40 ng/mL or 60-100 nmol/L.\n* Others recommend a level from 30-50 ng/mL (75-125 nmol/L).\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nA lower-than-normal level can be due to:\n\n* Lack of skin exposure to sunlight, darkly pigmented skin, or consistent use of high-SPF sunscreen\n* Lack of enough vitamin D in the diet\n* Liver and kidney diseases\n* Poor food absorption\n* Use of certain medicines, including phenytoin, phenobarbital, and rifampin\n* Poor vitamin D absorption due to advanced age, weight-loss surgery, or conditions in which fat is not absorbed well\n\nA low vitamin D level is more common in:\n\n* African American children (especially in the winter)\n* Infants who are breastfed only\n\nA higher-than-normal vitamin D level (hypervitaminosis D) can be caused by taking too much vitamin D. This can result in:\n\n* Too much calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia)\n* Many symptoms and kidney damage\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. However, other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* 25-OH vitamin D test\n* Calcidiol\n* 25-hydroxycholecalciferol test\n\n**References**\n\n* Bouillon R, Verlinden L, Carmeliet G.

Most babies with 2q37 deletion syndrome are born with weak muscle tone (hypotonia), which usually improves with age. Other neurological abnormalities that are common in affected individuals include:\n\n* Mild to severe intellectual disability\n* Delayed development of motor skills, such as sitting and walking\n* Behavioral problems\nAbout 25 percent of people with this condition have autism spectrum disorder, a developmental condition that affects communication and social interaction.\n\nUnusual physical features are also common in people with 2q37 deletion syndrome. About half of affected individuals have unusually short fingers and toes (brachydactyly), often with abnormally short fourth toes that may overlap the other toes. Additional features of this condition may include:\n\n* Short stature\n* Obesity\n* Sparse hair\n\nMany people with 2q37 deletion syndrome have characteristic facial features that can include:\n\n* A prominent forehead\n* A low frontal hairline\n* Thin eyelids\n* Skin folds covering the inner corner of the eyes (epicanthal folds)\n* Outside corners of the eyes that point upward (upslanting palpebral fissures)\n* A small nose\n* A small mouth with thin lips\n* A smooth space between the upper lip and nose (smooth philtrum)\n* Prominent cheekbones\n* A large chin\n* Minor ear abnormalities\n\nOther features of 2q37 deletion syndrome can include:\n\n* Seizures\n* An inflammatory skin disorder called eczema\n* Malformations of the brain, heart, gastrointestinal system, kidneys, or genitalia\n* A rare form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Frequency**\n\nNo information available.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe cause of 2q37 deletion syndrome is a deletion in chromosome 2 that involves a region known as q37. This deletion can occur randomly during the formation of reproductive cells or eggs and sperm, or it can be inherited from an affected parent.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n2q37 deletion syndrome is usually caused by a random event during the formation of reproductive cells or eggs and sperm. However, in some cases, it may be inherited from an affected parent. If one parent has 2q37 deletion syndrome, each child has a:\n\n* 50% chance of inheriting the condition\n* 25% chance of not being affected but carrying the deletion\n* 25% chance of not being affected and not carrying the deletion\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\nNo information available.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information about 2q37 deletion syndrome, you can contact:\n\n* The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)\n* The National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\nNo information available.\n\n---\n\n**2q37 Deletion Syndrome**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Description**\n2q37 deletion syndrome is a rare condition characterized by various physical and neurological features. It is caused by deletions of genetic material from the long (q) arm of chromosome 2, specifically at location 2q37.\n\n**Physical Features**\n\n* *Unusual physical characteristics:*\n + Unusually short fingers and toes (brachydactyly)\n + Abnormally short fourth toes that may overlap other toes\n + Short stature\n + Obesity\n + Sparse hair\n* *Characteristic facial features:*\n + Prominent forehead\n + Low frontal hairline\n + Thin eyelids\n + Skin folds covering the inner corner of the eyes (epicanthal folds)\n + Outside corners of the eyes that point upward (upslanting palpebral fissures)\n + Small nose\n + Small mouth with thin lips\n + Smooth space between the upper lip and nose (smooth philtrum)\n + Prominent cheekbones\n + Large chin\n + Minor ear abnormalities\n\n**Other Features**\n\n* Seizures\n* Inflammatory skin disorder called eczema\n* Malformations of the brain, heart, gastrointestinal system, kidneys, or genitalia\n* Rare form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor\n\n**Frequency**\n2q37 deletion syndrome appears to be a rare condition. At least 115 cases have been reported worldwide.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe deletions occur near the end of chromosome 2 at location 2q37. The size of the deletion varies among affected individuals, with most missing 2 million to 9 million DNA building blocks (2 Mb to 9 Mb). Researchers are working to identify all genes whose loss contributes to the features of 2q37 deletion syndrome.\n\n* **HDAC4 gene:** Loss of this gene is likely to account for many characteristic signs of the syndrome, such as intellectual disability and skeletal abnormalities.\n* Other genes on chromosome 2 may also play a role in the disorder.\n\n**Inheritance**\nMost cases are not inherited. They result from a chromosomal deletion that occurs randomly during reproductive cell formation or early fetal development. Rarely, an affected individual inherits a copy of chromosome 2 with a deleted segment from an affected parent.\n\n---\n\n**2q37 Deletion Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\n\n**What is 2q37 deletion syndrome?**\n\n2q37 deletion syndrome, also known as 2q37 microdeletion syndrome or Albright hereditary osteodystrophy-like syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder caused by the deletion of a segment on chromosome 2. This condition typically results from a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Causes and Inheritance**\n\nThe causes of 2q37 deletion syndrome are not fully understood, but it is believed to result from a chromosomal deletion that occurs as a random event. Most cases are not inherited, meaning affected individuals typically have no history of the disorder in their family. However, rarely, an affected individual may inherit a copy of chromosome 2 with a deleted segment from an affected parent.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* 2q37 microdeletion syndrome\n* Albright hereditary osteodystrophy-like syndrome\n* Brachydactyly-mental retardation syndrome\n* Chromosome 2q37 deletion syndrome (disorder)\n* Deletion 2q37\n* Monosomy 2q37\n\n\\n\\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Chromosome 2q37 deletion syndrome\n\n\\n\\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center: 2q37 microdeletion syndrome\n* Patient Support and Advocacy Resources:\n\t+ National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* Clinical Trials:\n\t+ ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ CHROMOSOME 2q37 DELETION SYNDROME\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n\t+ PubMed\n\n\\n\\n\n**References**\n\n1.

Additionally, the disorder prevents the body from making ketones, which are compounds that are used for energy during periods without food (fasting).\n\nThe signs and symptoms of HMG-CoA lyase deficiency usually appear within the first year of life. The condition causes episodes of vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, extreme tiredness (lethargy), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). During an episode, blood sugar (glucose) levels can become dangerously low (hypoglycemia), and a buildup of harmful compounds can cause the blood to become too acidic (metabolic acidosis). If untreated, the disorder can lead to breathing problems, convulsions, coma, and death. Episodes are often triggered by an infection, fasting, strenuous exercise, or other types of stress.\n\nHMG-CoA lyase deficiency is sometimes mistaken for Reye syndrome, a severe disorder that develops in children while they appear to be recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or flu. Most cases of Reye syndrome are associated with the use of aspirin during these viral infections.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Frequency**\n-------------\n\nHMG-CoA lyase deficiency is a rare condition; it has been reported in fewer than 100 individuals worldwide. Most people diagnosed with this disorder have been from Saudi Arabia, Portugal, or Spain.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Causes**\n----------\n\nMutations in the HMGCL gene cause HMG-CoA lyase deficiency. The HMGCL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme known as 3-hydroxymethyl-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A lyase (HMG-CoA lyase). This enzyme plays a critical role in breaking down dietary proteins and fats for energy. Specifically, it is responsible for processing leucine, an amino acid that is part of many proteins. HMG-CoA lyase also produces ketones during the breakdown of fats.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n---------------------------------\n\n* HMG-CoA lyase deficiency\n\n\\n\\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n--------------------------------------\n\n* For more information about this condition, you may want to contact a university or medical school library that has a genetics expertise.

For example, ketones are important sources of energy during periods of fasting.\n\nIf a mutation in the HMGCL gene reduces or eliminates the activity of HMG-CoA lyase, the body is unable to process leucine or make ketones properly. When leucine is not processed normally, a buildup of chemical byproducts called organic acids can result in metabolic acidosis. A shortage of ketones often leads to hypoglycemia. Metabolic acidosis and hypoglycemia can damage cells, particularly in the brain, resulting in serious illness in children with HMG-CoA lyase deficiency.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Genetics**\n\n*   The HMGCL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme known as 3-hydroxymethyl-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A lyase (HMG-CoA lyase).\n*   This enzyme plays a critical role in breaking down dietary proteins and fats for energy.\n*   Specifically, it is responsible for processing leucine, an amino acid that is part of many proteins.

The HADH gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase.\n\nNormally, through a process called fatty acid oxidation, several enzymes work in a step-wise fashion to break down (metabolize) fats and convert them to energy. The 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase enzyme is required for a step that metabolizes groups of fats called medium-chain fatty acids and short-chain fatty acids.\n\nMutations in the HADH gene lead to a shortage of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Medium-chain and short-chain fatty acids cannot be metabolized properly without sufficient levels of this enzyme. As a result, these fatty acids are not converted to energy, which can lead to characteristic features of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, such as lethargy and hypoglycemia.\n\nMedium-chain and short-chain fatty acids that are not broken down can build up in tissues and damage the liver, heart, and muscles, causing serious complications. Conditions that disrupt the metabolism of fatty acids, including 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, are known as fatty acid oxidation disorders.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.

People with this disorder have a shortage of an enzyme that helps break down proteins that contain a particular building block (amino acid) called leucine.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of MCC deficiency can vary among individuals, even among individuals in the same family. Some people with the genetic changes that cause MCC deficiency will not develop symptoms until adulthood, while many will never develop signs or symptoms.\n\nSome affected individuals develop signs and symptoms in infancy or early childhood after an event such as an infection, a long period without food, or the introduction of a high-protein diet. Features of MCC deficiency may include:\n\n* *Feeding difficulties*\n* *Delayed development*\n* *Vomiting*\n* *Excessive tiredness (lethargy)*\n* *Weak muscle tone (hypotonia)*\n\nIf untreated, MCC deficiency can lead to seizures; breathing difficulties; and comas, which can be life-threatening.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n\\n\\n\nAs many as 1 in 36,000 newborns may receive a diagnosis of MCC deficiency.\n\n**Causes**\n\n\\n\\n\nVariants (also called mutations) in the MCCC1 or MCCC2 gene cause 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency. The condition is sometimes referred to as 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase 1 deficiency or 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase 2 deficiency depending on the specific gene that is affected.\n\nThese two genes provide instructions for making different parts (subunits) of an enzyme called 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC). This enzyme plays a critical role in breaking down proteins obtained from food. Specifically, MCC is responsible for the fourth step in the breakdown of leucine, an amino acid that is part of many proteins.\n\nVariants in the MCCC1 or MCCC2 gene reduce or eliminate the activity of MCC, preventing the body from processing leucine properly. In some people, these variants do not cause signs or symptoms. In others, toxic byproducts of leucine processing build up to harmful levels, which can damage the brain. This damage underlies the signs and symptoms of MCC deficiency.\n\n---\n\n**3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\n* Variants (also called mutations) in the MCCC1 or MCCC2 gene cause 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency.\n* These two genes provide instructions for making different parts (subunits) of an enzyme called 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC).\n* This enzyme plays a critical role in breaking down proteins obtained from food, specifically the fourth step in the breakdown of leucine.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n* This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.\n* Both copies of either the MCCC1 gene or the MCCC2 gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder.\n* These gene variants increase the risk of developing the signs and symptoms of MCC deficiency.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* 3-MCC deficiency\n* 3-methylcrotonylglycinuria\n* BMCC deficiency\n* Deficiency of methylcrotonoyl-CoA carboxylase\n* MCC deficiency\n* MCCD\n* Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency\n* Methylcrotonyl-coenzyme A carboxylase deficiency\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Genetic Testing Information**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase 1 deficiency\n* Genetic Testing Registry: 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase 2 deficiency\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n* **Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**\n\t+ 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency\n* **Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\t+ National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* **Clinical Trials**\n\t+ ClinicalTrials.gov\n* **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\t+ 3-METHYLCROTONYL-CoA CARBOXYLASE 1 DEFICIENCY; MCC1D\n\t+ 3-METHYLCROTONYL-CoA CARBOXYLASE 2 DEFICIENCY; MCC2D\n* **Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\t+ PubMed\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n* Arnold GL, Koeberl DD, Matern D, Barshop B, Braverman N, Burton B, Cederbaum S, Fiegenbaum A, Garganta C, Gibson J, Goodman SI, Harding C, Kahler S, Kronn D, Longo N.

Beginning in infancy to early childhood, children with this condition often have delayed development of mental and motor skills (psychomotor delay), speech delay, involuntary muscle cramping (dystonia), and spasms and weakness of the arms and legs (spastic quadriparesis). Affected individuals can also have optic atrophy, which is the breakdown (atrophy) of nerve cells that carry visual information from the eyes to the brain.\n\nIn some cases, signs and symptoms of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency begin in adulthood, often in a person's twenties or thirties. These individuals have damage to a type of brain tissue called white matter (leukoencephalopathy). This damage likely contributes to progressive problems with speech (dysarthria), difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), stiffness (spasticity), optic atrophy, and a decline in intellectual function (dementia).\n\nAffected individuals who show symptoms of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency in childhood often go on to develop leukoencephalopathy and other neurological problems in adulthood.\n\nAll people with 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency accumulate large amounts of a substance called 3-methylglutaconic acid in their body fluids. As a result, they have elevated levels of acid in their blood (metabolic acidosis) and excrete large amounts of acid in their urine (aciduria). 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency is one of a group of metabolic disorders that can be diagnosed by the presence of increased levels 3-methylglutaconic acid in urine (3-methylglutaconic aciduria). People with 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency also have high urine levels of another acid called 3-methylglutaric acid.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n* The exact frequency of this condition is not known.\n\n**Causes**\n\n* This condition is caused by mutations in the AUH gene.\n* It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n* Autosomal recessive\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* 3-Methylglutaconic aciduria\n* 3-Methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* For more information about this condition, you can visit the National Institutes of Health (NIH) website or contact a genetics professional.\n\n**References**\n\n* [List of references]\n\nNote: The provided content was cleaned and formatted for display.

It affects the breakdown of an amino acid called leucine, leading to a buildup of related compounds in the body.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the AUH gene cause 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency. This gene provides instructions for producing 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase, an enzyme that is involved in breaking down leucine to provide energy for cells. AUH gene mutations lead to an absence of enzyme activity, resulting in a buildup of related compounds, including multiple acids: 3-methylglutaconic acid, 3-methylglutaric acid, and 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nThis condition is rare; at least 20 cases have been reported in the scientific literature.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nAffected individuals often experience delayed development of mental and motor skills (psychomotor delay), speech delay, involuntary muscle cramping (dystonia), spasms and weakness of the arms and legs (spastic quadriparesis), optic atrophy, progressive problems with speech (dysarthria), difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), stiffness (spasticity), and a decline in intellectual function (dementia).\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.\n\n**Complications**\n\nAffected individuals who show symptoms of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency in childhood often go on to develop leukoencephalopathy and other neurological problems in adulthood.

  "6cf562ad7bd6c6686c42f655da943dbe": "**5-HTP**\n\n\\n\\n\n**What is it?**\n-----------------\n\n5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) can be converted to serotonin in the body. It is often used for depression. It has less evidence for insomnia and anxiety.\n\n5-HTP is a chemical byproduct of the protein building block L-tryptophan. It is produced commercially from the seeds of an African plant known as Griffonia simplicifolia. 5-HTP works in the brain and central nervous system by increasing the production of the chemical serotonin. Serotonin can affect sleep, appetite, temperature, sexual behavior, and pain sensation.\n\nSince 5-HTP increases serotonin levels, it is used for conditions in which serotonin is believed to play an important role. These include depression, anxiety, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.\n\n\\n\\n\n**How effective is it?**\n-------------------------\n\nNatural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\n\nThe effectiveness ratings for 5-HTP are as follows:\n\n* **Possibly effective for:** Depression. Taking 5-HTP by mouth seems to improve symptoms of depression in some people. It might work as well as some prescription antidepressant drugs.\n* **Possibly ineffective for:** Down syndrome. Most research shows that taking 5-HTP by mouth does not improve muscle strength or development in children with Down syndrome.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Is it safe?**\n-----------------\n\nWhen taken by mouth: It is possibly safe to take 5-HTP in doses of up to 400 mg daily for up to one year. The most common side effects include heartburn, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, drowsiness, sexual problems, and muscle problems. Large doses of 5-HTP, such as 6-10 grams daily, are possibly unsafe. These doses have been linked to severe stomach problems and muscle spasms.\n\nSome people who have taken 5-HTP have developed a serious health condition called eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS). Some people think EMS might be caused by an accidental contaminant in some 5-HTP products. But there's not enough scientific evidence to know if EMS is caused by 5-HTP, a contaminant, or some other factor. Until more is known, 5-HTP should be used cautiously.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Special precautions & warnings:**\n-----------------------------------\n\n* **Pregnancy and breast-feeding:** There isn't enough reliable information to know if 5-HTP is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n* **Children:** It is possibly safe for children to take 5-HTP by mouth at appropriate doses. In children under 12 years of age, 5-HTP seems to be safe at a dose of up to 5 mg/kg daily for up to 3 years.\n* **Surgery:** 5-HTP can affect a brain chemical called serotonin. Some drugs administered during surgery can also affect serotonin. Taking 5-HTP before surgery might cause too much serotonin in the brain and can result in serious side effects including heart problems, shivering, and anxiety. Tell patients to stop taking 5-HTP at least 2 weeks before surgery.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Other names:**\n-----------------\n\n* Griffonia simplicifolia\n\n\\n\\n\n**Methodology:**\n------------------\n\nThis information is based on the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database, which rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\n\n\\n\\n\n**References:**\n-----------------\n\n* Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database\n\n---\n\n**5-HTP: MedlinePlus Supplements (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Category:** drug&supplements\n\n**Children**\nIt is possibly safe for children to take 5-HTP by mouth at appropriate doses. In children under 12 years of age, 5-HTP seems to be safe at a dose of up to 5 mg/kg daily for up to 3 years.\n\n**Surgery**\n5-HTP can affect a brain chemical called serotonin. Some drugs administered during surgery can also affect serotonin. Taking 5-HTP before surgery might cause too much serotonin in the brain and can result in serious side effects including heart problems, shivering, and anxiety. Tell patients to stop taking 5-HTP at least 2 weeks before surgery.\n\n**Interactions with Medications**\n\n*   **Moderate**: Be cautious with this combination.\n    *   Carbidopa (Lodosyn)\n        + 5-HTP can affect the brain. Carbidopa can also affect the brain. Taking 5-HTP along with carbidopa can increase the risk of serious side effects including rapid speech, anxiety, aggressiveness, and others.\n    *   Sedative medications (CNS depressants)\n        + 5-HTP might cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Some medications, called sedatives, can also cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Taking 5-HTP with sedative medications might cause breathing problems and/or too much sleepiness.\n    *   Serotonergic drugs\n        + 5-HTP might increase a brain chemical called serotonin. Some medications also have this effect. Taking 5-HTP along with these medications might increase serotonin too much. This might cause serious side effects including heart problems, seizures, and vomiting.\n\n**Interactions with Herbs and Supplements**\n\n*   **Herbs and supplements with sedative properties**\n    + 5-HTP might cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Taking it along with other supplements with similar effects might cause too much sleepiness and/or slowed breathing in some people. Examples of supplements with this effect include hops, kava, L-tryptophan, melatonin, and valerian.\n*   **Herbs and supplements with serotonergic properties**\n    + 5-HTP increases a brain chemical called serotonin. Taking it along with other supplements that have this effect might cause serious side effects, including heart problems, seizures, and vomiting. Examples of supplements with this effect include black seed, L-tryptophan, SAMe, and St. John's wort.\n\n**Interactions with Foods**\nThere are no known interactions with foods.\n\n**How is it typically used?**\n5-HTP has most often been used by adults in doses of 150-800 mg daily. Very large doses of 5-HTP, such as 6-10 grams daily, can cause serious side effects and should be avoided. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what dose might be best for a specific condition.\n\n**Other names**\n2-Amino-3-(5-Hydroxy-1H-Indol-3-yl) Propanoic Acid, 5 Hydroxy-Tryptophan, 5 Hydroxy-Tryptophane, 5-Hydroxytryptophan, 5-Hydroxytryptophane, 5-Hydroxy L-Tryptophan, 5-Hydroxy L-Tryptophane, 5-Hydroxy Tryptophan, 5-L-Hydroxytryptophan, L-5 HTP, L-5-Hydroxytryptophan, L-5-Hydroxytryptophane, Oxitriptan.\n\n**References**\n1.

A clinical trial is a study using people who agree to participate in new tests or treatments. Clinical trials help researchers know whether a new treatment works well and is safe. Trials are available for many cancers and all stages of cancer, not just advanced cancer.\n\n**What is a Clinical Trial for Cancer?**\n\nClinical trials for cancer look at ways to:\n\n* Prevent cancer\n* Screen or test for cancer\n* Treat or manage cancer\n* Reduce symptoms or side effects of cancer or cancer treatments\n\nA clinical trial will recruit many people to participate. During the study, each group of people will receive a different test or treatment. Some will get the new treatment being tested. Others will get standard treatment. The researchers will collect the results to see what works best.\n\n**Why Should You Consider a Clinical Trial?**\n\nThe decision to join a clinical trial is a personal one. It is a decision you have to make based on your values, goals, and expectations. Plus, there are benefits and risks when you join a trial.\n\nSome of the benefits include:\n\n* You may receive a new treatment that is not yet available to other people.\n* You may receive treatment that is better than what is currently available.\n* You will receive close attention and monitoring by your providers.\n* You will help researchers understand your cancer and learn better ways to help other people with the same cancer.\n\nSome of the potential risks include:\n\n* You may experience side effects.\n* The new treatment may not work for you.\n* The new treatment may not be as good as standard treatment.\n* You may need more office visits and more tests.\n* Your insurance may not pay for all of your costs in a clinical trial.\n\n**Is It Safe?**\n\nThere are strict federal rules in place to protect your safety during a clinical trial. Safety guidelines (protocols) are agreed to before the study begins. These guidelines are reviewed by health experts to make sure that the study is based on good science and the risks are low. Clinical trials are also monitored during the entire study.\n\n**Is There a Cost?**\n\nBefore you join a trial, make sure you look into which costs are covered.

You can also go over all of the risks and benefits to decide whether joining a trial is a good move for you.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n*   *Intervention study - cancer*\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n*   American Cancer Society website.

Know that what you tell your child will help your child face cancer. Explaining things honestly at the right level for your child's age will help your child be less afraid.\n\n**Children Understand Things Differently Based on Their Age**\n\nKnowing what your child may understand, and what questions they may ask, can help you know better what to say.\n\n**What Can My Child Understand?**\n\nEach child is different. Some children understand more than others. Your day-to-day approach will depend on your child's age and maturity. Here is a general guide.\n\n*   **CHILDREN AGES 0 to 2 YEARS**\n    *   Children this age:\n        *   Only understand things that they can sense by touch and sight\n        *   Do not understand cancer\n        *   Focus on what is happening in the moment\n        *   Are afraid of medical tests and pain\n        *   Are afraid of being away from their parents\n\n    *   How to talk to children ages 0 to 2 years:\n        *   Talk to your child about what is happening in the moment or that day.\n        *   Explain procedures and tests before you arrive. For example, let your child know that the needle will hurt for a bit, and it is OK to cry.\n        *   Give your child choices, such as fun ways to take medicine, new books or videos during treatments, or mixing medicines with different juices.\n        *   Let your child know you will always be by their side at the hospital.\n        *   Explain how long they will be in the hospital and when they will be going home.\n\n*   **CHILDREN AGES 2 to 7 YEARS**\n    *   Children this age:\n        *   May understand cancer when you explain using simple words\n        *   Look for cause and effect. They may blame the illness on a specific event, such as not finishing dinner.\n        *   Are afraid of being away from their parents.\n        *   May be afraid that they will have to live in the hospital.\n        *   Are afraid of medical tests and pain.\n\n    *   How to talk to children ages 2 to 7 years:\n        *   Use simple terms like \"good cells\" and \"bad cells\" to explain the cancer. You can say it is a contest between the two types of cells.\n        *   Tell your child that they need treatment so that the hurting will go away and the good cells can get stronger.\n        *   Make sure your child knows that nothing they did caused the cancer.\n        *   Explain procedures and tests before you arrive.

People use them to help prevent or cure disease, get relief from symptoms, boost energy, relax, or lose weight.\n\n**Herbals Are Not Medicines**\n\nYou have to be careful when using an herbal remedy. They are a type of dietary supplement and not medicines. Here are some things you should know about herbals:\n\n* Herbals are not regulated like medicines.\n* Herbals do not need to be rigidly tested before they are sold.\n* Herbals may not work as claimed.\n* Labels do not need to be approved by any authority, and it may not list the correct amount of an ingredient.\n* Some herbal remedies may contain ingredients or contaminants not listed on the label.\n\n**Natural Does Not Mean Safe**\n\nMany people think that using plants to treat illness is safer than taking medicine. However, \"natural\" does not mean safe. Unless taken as directed, some herbals can interact with other medicines or be toxic at high doses. Also, some may cause side effects.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n* Kava: an herb used for anxiety, insomnia, symptoms of menopause, and other ailments. It may work for anxiety but can also cause severe liver damage.\n* St. John's Wort: may work for mild to moderate depression but can interact with birth control pills, antidepressants, and other medicines, causing side effects such as stomach upset and anxiety.\n* Yohimbe: a bark used to treat erectile dysfunction. It can cause high blood pressure, increased heart rate, anxiety, and other side effects.\n\n**How to Choose and Use Herbal Remedies Safely**\n\nSome herbals can make you feel better and help keep you healthy. But you need to be a smart consumer. Use these tips when choosing herbal remedies:\n\n* Look closely at the claims made about the product.\n* Be wary of \"miracle\" pills or products that claim to work faster than regular care.\n* Remember that real-life stories are not scientific proof.\n* Talk with your provider before trying a product, and ask for their opinion on its safety and effectiveness.\n* Buy only from companies that have certification on the label, such as \"USP Verified\" or \"ConsumerLab.com Approved Quality.\"\n* Do not give herbal supplements to children or use them if you are older than age 65 years. Talk to your provider first.\n* Do not use herbals without talking to your provider if you are taking any medicines.\n* Do not use them if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Do not use them if you are having surgery.\n\n**Where to Get More Information**\n\nThese sites can help you learn more about specific herbal supplements:\n\n* NIH MedlinePlus database of herbs and supplements\n* The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH): Herbs at a glance\n* American Cancer Society: Complementary and alternative medicine\n\n---\n\n**A Guide to Herbal Remedies**\n\n**Choosing and Using Herbal Remedies Safely**\n\nSome herbal remedies can make you feel better and help keep you healthy, but you need to be a smart consumer.

If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is not true.\n* Remember that \"real-life stories\" are not scientific proof.\n* Before trying a product, talk with your provider.

Some herbals can cause high blood pressure, increased heart rate, anxiety, and other side effects. They can also interact with certain medicines for depression. Taking them in high doses or for a long time can be dangerous.\n\n**The Importance of Choosing Herbal Remedies Safely**\n\nWhile some herbal remedies have been tested and work well for their intended purpose, many are not safe to use without proper guidance. The word \"natural\" does not mean safe. Unless taken as directed, some herbals can interact with other medicines or be toxic at high doses. They may also cause side effects.\n\n**How to Choose and Use Herbal Remedies Safely**\n\n*   Look closely at the claims made about the product. Be wary of products that promise \"miracle\" results or are described as a secret that your health care provider and drug companies don't want you to know.\n*   Remember that \"real-life stories\" are not scientific proof. Many products are promoted with real-life stories, but there's no proof that other people will get the same results.\n*   Before trying a product, talk with your provider. Ask for their opinion on whether the product is safe and effective.\n*   Buy only from companies that have certification on the label, such as \"USP Verified\" or \"ConsumerLab.com Approved Quality.\"\n*   Do not give herbal supplements to children or use them if you are older than age 65 years without talking to your provider first.\n*   Do not use herbals without talking to your provider if you are taking any medicines.\n*   Do not use them if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or having surgery.\n\n**Where to Get More Information**\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about specific herbal supplements, consider the following resources:\n\n*   NIH MedlinePlus database of herbs and supplements: <https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/herb_All.html>\n*   The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH): Herbs at a glance: <https://nccih.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm>\n*   American Cancer Society: Complementary and alternative medicine: <https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/complementary-and-alternative-medicine.html>\n\n**References**\n\nAronson JK.

It helps to show how well you are controlling your blood sugar to prevent complications from diabetes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThere are two methods available for performing an A1C test:\n\n*   Blood drawn from a vein, done at a lab\n*   Finger stick, which can be done in a healthcare provider's office or at home with a prescribed kit. Results by finger stick may differ slightly from blood drawn from a vein but can still be used to monitor treatment.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is needed for an A1C test. The food you have recently eaten does not affect the test, so fasting is not required.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\n*   Finger stick: You may feel slight pain\n*   Blood drawn from a vein: You may feel a slight pinch or some stinging when the needle is inserted. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise, which soon goes away.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nYour healthcare provider may order an A1C test if you have diabetes to show how well you are controlling your condition. The test can also be used to screen for diabetes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Ask Your Provider**\n\n*   How often you should have your A1C level tested\n*   Usually, people with diabetes should test every 3 or 6 months\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe following results are common when using the A1C test to diagnose diabetes:\n\n*   Normal (no diabetes): Less than 5.7%\n*   Pre-diabetes: 5.7% to 6.4%\n*   Diabetes: 6.5% or higher\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAn abnormal result means that you have had a high blood sugar level over a period of weeks to months.\n\n*   If your A1C is 6.5% or higher and you do not already have diabetes, you may be diagnosed with diabetes.\n*   If your level is above 7% and you have diabetes, it often means that your blood sugar is not as well controlled as would be ideal. You and your provider should determine your target A1C.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. However, other risks of having blood drawn are slight but may include:\n\n*   Excessive bleeding\n*   Multiple punctures to locate veins\n*   Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n*   Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n*   Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Topics**\n\n*   A1C\n*   Blood Glucose\n*   Diabetes\n*   Diabetes Type 1\n*   Diabetes Type 2\n*   Diabetes in Children and Teens\n\n---\n\n**A1C Test**\n\nThe A1C test is a lab test that shows the average level of blood sugar (glucose) over the previous 3 months. It helps to determine how well you are controlling your blood sugar and preventing complications from diabetes.\n\n**How the Test is Performed**\n\nThere are two methods available for performing an A1C test:\n\n*   Blood drawn from a vein, which is done at a lab.\n*   Finger stick, which can be done in your health care provider's office or at home using a prescribed kit. Results by finger stick may differ slightly from blood drawn from a vein.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nNo special preparation is needed for an A1C test. The food you have recently eaten does not affect the test, so fasting is not required.\n\n**What to Expect During the Test**\n\nWith a finger stick, you may feel slight pain. With blood drawn from a vein, you may feel a slight pinch or some stinging when the needle is inserted. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise, but this usually goes away soon.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nYour provider may order an A1C test if you have diabetes to determine how well you are controlling your condition. The test may also be used to screen for diabetes. Your provider will recommend how often you should have your A1C level tested, which is usually every 3 or 6 months for people with diabetes.\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe following are the results when an A1C test is being used to diagnose diabetes:\n\n*   Normal (no diabetes): Less than 5.7%\n*   Pre-diabetes: 5.7% to 6.4%\n*   Diabetes: 6.5% or higher\n\nIf you have diabetes, your provider will discuss the ideal range for you based on your age. For many people, the goal is to keep the level below 7%.\n\n---\n\n**A1C Test**\n\nThe A1C test is a blood test that measures the average level of glucose in your blood over the past 2 to 3 months.\n\n**When Is an A1C Test Ordered?**\n\nAn A1C test may be ordered if you have symptoms of diabetes, such as:\n\n* Increased thirst and urination\n* Fatigue\n* Blurred vision\n* Cuts or wounds that are slow to heal\n\nThe test may also be ordered for people who do not have symptoms but are at risk for developing diabetes, such as those with a family history of the disease, certain ethnic backgrounds, or obesity.\n\n**How Is an A1C Test Performed?**\n\nAn A1C test is performed by taking a sample of your blood. The blood is then sent to a laboratory where it is analyzed for glucose levels.\n\n**What Do A1C Results Mean?**\n\nThe results of an A1C test can indicate whether you have diabetes or are at risk for developing the disease. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n* **Normal Result:** Less than 5.7%\n* **Prediabetes:** 5.7% to 6.4%\n* **Diabetes:** 6.5% or higher\n\nIf your A1C is 6.5% or higher and you do not already have diabetes, you may be diagnosed with diabetes.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nAn abnormal result means that you have had a high blood sugar level over a period of weeks to months.\n\n* If your A1C is 6.5% or higher and you do not already have diabetes, you may be diagnosed with diabetes.\n* If your level is above 7% and you have diabetes, it often means that your blood sugar is not as well controlled as would be ideal. You and your provider should determine your target A1C.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks of having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\n* Excessive bleeding\n* Multiple punctures to locate veins\n* Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n* Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n* Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* HbA1C test\n* Glycated hemoglobin test\n* Glycohemoglobin test\n* Hemoglobin A1C\n* Diabetes - A1C\n* Diabetic - A1C\n\n**Patient Instructions**\n\n* If you have diabetes, work with your healthcare provider to manage your blood sugar levels.\n* Follow a healthy diet and exercise plan to help control your blood sugar.\n* Monitor your blood sugar levels regularly using a glucose meter or continuous glucose monitor.\n\n**References**\n\n* American Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 6.

It measures your average blood glucose, or blood sugar, level over the past 3 months. Doctors may use the A1C alone or in combination with other diabetes tests to make a diagnosis. They also use the A1C to see how well you are managing your diabetes.\n\n**How is A1C measured?**\n\nYour A1C test result is given in percentages. The higher the percentage, the higher your blood sugar levels have been:\n\n* A normal A1C level is below 5.7%\n* Prediabetes is between 5.7 to 6.4%. Having prediabetes is a risk factor for getting type 2 diabetes.\n* Type 2 diabetes is above 6.5%\n\n**When should you get an A1C test?**\n\nIf you have diabetes, you should have the A1C test at least twice a year.

Within cells, ALADIN is found in the nuclear envelope, the structure that surrounds the nucleus and separates it from the rest of the cell. Based on its location, ALADIN is thought to be involved in the movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Triple A syndrome\n  At least 49 mutations in the AAAS gene have been found to cause triple A syndrome. These mutations change the structure of ALADIN in different ways; however, almost all mutations prevent this protein from reaching its proper location in the nuclear envelope. The absence of ALADIN likely disrupts the movement of molecules across this membrane. Researchers suspect that DNA repair proteins may be unable to enter the nucleus if ALADIN is missing from the nuclear envelope. DNA damage that is not repaired can cause the cell to become unstable and lead to cell death. Although the nervous system is particularly vulnerable to DNA damage, it remains unknown exactly how mutations in the AAAS gene lead to the signs and symptoms of triple A syndrome.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* AAA\n* AAAS_HUMAN\n* AAASb\n* achalasia, adrenocortical insufficiency, alacrimia (Allgrove, triple-A)\n* ADRACALA\n* ADRACALIN\n* ALADIN\n* DKFZp586G1624\n* GL003\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n  * Tests of AAAS\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n  * PubMed\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n  * ALADIN WD REPEAT NUCLEOPORIN; AAAS\n\n---\n\n**AAAS Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Gene and Variant Databases**\n\n*   **NCBI Gene**\n*   **ClinVar**\n\n**Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry**\n\n*   **Tests of AAAS**\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/)\n*   Brooks BP, Kleta R, Stuart C, Tuchman M, Jeong A, Stergiopoulos SG, Bei T, Bjornson B, Russell L, Chanoine JP, Tsagarakis S, Kalsner L, Stratakis C.

This enzyme is found in most tissues, with the highest amounts found in the liver. Aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase is involved in the breakdown of the amino acid lysine, a building block of most proteins. It is called a bifunctional enzyme because it performs two functions:\n\n* One function, called lysine-ketoglutarate reductase, breaks down lysine to a molecule called saccharopine.\n* The other function, called saccharopine dehydrogenase, breaks down saccharopine to a molecule called alpha-aminoadipate semialdehyde.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nHyperlysinemia\n\nAt least five mutations in the AASS gene have been found to cause hyperlysinemia. Most of these mutations change single amino acids in aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase. These mutations are thought to decrease or eliminate enzyme activity, resulting in an inability to break down lysine. Lysine that is not broken down accumulates in the blood, but it typically causes no health problems.\n\nWhen mutations in the AASS gene impair the breakdown of saccharopine, this molecule builds up in blood and urine. This buildup is sometimes referred to as saccharopinuria, which is considered to be a variant of hyperlysinemia. It is unclear if saccharopinuria causes any symptoms.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* AASS_HUMAN\n* alpha-aminoadipate semialdehyde synthase\n* aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase\n* LKR/SDH\n* lysine-2-oxoglutarate reductase\n* lysine-ketoglutarate reductase / saccharopine dehydrogenase\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n  * Tests of AASS\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n  * PubMed\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n  * ALPHA-AMINOADIPIC SEMIALDEHYDE SYNTHASE; AASS\n\n---\n\n**AASS Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Gene and Variant Databases**\n\n*   **NCBI Gene**\n*   **ClinVar**\n\n**Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry**\n\n*   **Tests of AASS**\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   Markovitz PJ, Chuang DT, Cox RP.

This enzyme helps break down a brain chemical (neurotransmitter) called GABA when it is not needed. GABA normally helps slow down (inhibit) brain cell activity when necessary, to prevent the brain from being overloaded with too many signals. For this reason GABA is called an inhibitory neurotransmitter.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nGABA-transaminase deficiency\n* At least 10 mutations in the ABAT gene have been identified in people with GABA-transaminase deficiency, which is a brain disease (encephalopathy) that begins in infancy.\n* Babies with this disorder have recurrent seizures (epilepsy), movement problems, and profoundly delayed development. They may grow more rapidly in length than usual (accelerated linear growth), even though they have feeding problems and may not gain weight as quickly as expected (failure to thrive). Individuals with this disorder usually do not survive past the first 2 years of life, but some live longer into childhood.\n\nThe ABAT gene mutations that cause GABA-transaminase deficiency lead to a shortage (deficiency) of functional GABA-transaminase enzyme. As a result, GABA is not properly broken down, so this neurotransmitter and another molecule called beta-alanine accumulate abnormally in brain cells. This accumulation alters the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain, leading to the neurological problems characteristic of GABA-transaminase deficiency.\n\nExcess GABA also leads to abnormal release of a protein that is necessary for growth of the body's bones and tissues (growth hormone), resulting in the accelerated linear growth that sometimes occurs in this disorder.\n\n---\n\n**ABAT Gene**\n\n**What is the ABAT gene?**\n\nThe ABAT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called GABA transaminase, which plays a crucial role in the breakdown of a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain.\n\n**How does mutations in the ABAT gene affect the body?**\n\nMutations in the ABAT gene can lead to a condition known as GABA-transaminase deficiency.

These genes provide instructions for making proteins that transport molecules across cell membranes. The ABCA1 protein is produced in many tissues, but high levels of this protein are found in the liver and in immune cells called macrophages.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe ABCA1 protein helps move cholesterol and certain fats called phospholipids across the cell membrane to the outside of the cell. These substances are then picked up by a protein called apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), which is produced from the APOA1 gene. ApoA-I, cholesterol, and phospholipids combine to make high-density lipoprotein (HDL), often referred to as \"good cholesterol\" because high levels of this substance reduce the chances of developing heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease.\n\nHDL carries cholesterol and phospholipids through the bloodstream from the body's tissues to the liver. Once in the liver, cholesterol and phospholipids are redistributed to other tissues or removed from the body. The process of removing excess cholesterol from cells is extremely important for balancing cholesterol levels and maintaining cardiovascular health.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Familial HDL Deficiency**\n  * Variants (also called mutations) in the ABCA1 gene can cause a condition called familial HDL deficiency.\n  * People with this condition have reduced levels of HDL in their blood and may experience early-onset cardiovascular disease, often before age 50.\n  * While one copy of the altered ABCA1 gene causes familial HDL deficiency, two copies of the altered gene cause a more severe disorder called Tangier disease (described below).\n  * Most ABCA1 gene variants that cause familial HDL deficiency change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ABCA1 protein.

Most of these variants change single amino acids in the ABCA1 protein. These variants prevent the release of cholesterol and phospholipids from cells. As a result, these substances accumulate within cells, causing certain body tissues to enlarge and the tonsils to acquire a yellowish-orange color. A buildup of cholesterol can be toxic to cells, leading to impaired cell function or cell death. In addition, the inability to transport cholesterol and phospholipids out of cells results in very low HDL levels, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. All these factors cause the signs and symptoms of Tangier disease.\n\n**Familial HDL Deficiency**\n\n* Variants (also called mutations) in the ABCA1 gene can cause a condition called familial HDL deficiency.\n* People with this condition have reduced levels of HDL in their blood and may experience early-onset cardiovascular disease, often before age 50.\n* While one copy of the altered ABCA1 gene causes familial HDL deficiency, two copies of the altered gene cause a more severe disorder called Tangier disease (described below).\n* Most ABCA1 gene variants that cause familial HDL deficiency change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ABCA1 protein.

Surfactant is a mixture of certain fats (called phospholipids) and proteins that lines the lung tissue and makes breathing easy. Without normal surfactant, the tissue surrounding the air sacs in the lungs (the alveoli) sticks together after exhalation (because of a force called surface tension), causing the alveoli to collapse. As a result, filling the lungs with air on each breath becomes very difficult, and delivery of oxygen to the body is impaired.\n\nThe ABCA3 protein is found in the membrane that surrounds lamellar bodies, which are the cellular structures in which the phospholipids and proteins that make up surfactant are packaged. The ABCA3 protein transports phospholipids into the lamellar bodies where they interact with surfactant proteins to form surfactant. The ABCA3 protein also appears to be involved in the formation of normal lamellar bodies. In addition to packaging, lamellar bodies are important for the correct processing of surfactant proteins, which is necessary for the proteins to mature and become functional.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nSurfactant dysfunction due to mutations in this gene (often called ABCA3 deficiency) can cause severe, often fatal breathing problems in newborns or gradual onset of milder breathing problems in children or adults. Some mutations in the ABCA3 gene lead to the production of a protein that is not inserted into the lamellar body membrane. Other mutations lead to the production of an abnormal protein that is found in the lamellar body membrane but has little or no function.\n\nWithout ABCA3 protein function, the transport of surfactant phospholipids is decreased. In addition, lamellar body formation is impaired, which causes abnormal processing of surfactant proteins. ABCA3 gene mutations result in abnormal surfactant composition and function. The loss of functional surfactant raises surface tension in the alveoli, causing difficulty breathing and collapse of the lungs.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n*   (no information available)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   (no information available)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n*   (no information available)\n\n---\n\n**ABCA3 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Surfactant Dysfunction**\n\n* More than 100 ABCA3 gene mutations that cause surfactant dysfunction have been identified.\n* Surfactant dysfunction due to mutations in this gene (often called ABCA3 deficiency) can cause severe, often fatal breathing problems in newborns or gradual onset of milder breathing problems in children or adults.\n\nSome mutations in the ABCA3 gene lead to the production of a protein that is not inserted into the lamellar body membrane.

It is estimated that ABCA4 gene variants account for 30 to 60 percent of cases of cone-rod dystrophy that are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder.\n  Most of the ABCA4 gene variants that cause cone-rod dystrophy change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ABCA4 protein. The altered protein cannot remove N-retinylidene-PE from photoreceptors. As a result, N-retinylidene-PE combines with another substance to produce a molecule called N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine (A2E), which builds up in these cells. The buildup of A2E is toxic to photoreceptors and leads to their deterioration, causing progressive vision loss in people with cone-rod dystrophy.\n\n* **Stargardt Macular Degeneration**\n  More than 1,000 variants in the ABCA4 gene have been found to cause Stargardt macular degeneration. Variants in this gene are the most common cause of this eye disease. Stargardt macular degeneration is characterized by vision loss that worsens over time.\n  Most of these variants change amino acids in the ABCA4 protein. A malfunctioning ABCA4 protein cannot remove N-retinylidene-PE from photoreceptors. As a result, N-retinylidene-PE combines with another substance to produce a fatty yellow pigment called lipofuscin, which builds up in retinal cells. The buildup of lipofuscin is toxic to the cells of the retina and causes progressive vision loss in people with Stargardt macular degeneration.\n\n* **Age-Related Macular Degeneration**\n  MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Age-related macular degeneration\n\n---\n\n**ABCA4 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Retinitis Pigmentosa**\n\n*   MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Retinitis pigmentosa.

Bile salts are a component of bile that help the body digest fats. Bile salts are produced by liver cells and then transported out of the cell by the BSEP to make bile. The release of bile salts from liver cells is critical for the normal secretion of bile.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Benign Recurrent Intrahepatic Cholestasis (BRIC2)**\n  Variants in the ABCB11 gene can cause benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (BRIC2). This condition is characterized by episodes of liver dysfunction, severe itching (pruritus), and yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice).\n  Affected individuals have a variant in both copies of the ABCB11 gene. Variants that cause BRIC2 lead to a 40 to 50 percent reduction of bile salt transport. The resulting buildup of bile salts in the liver leads to the signs and symptoms of BRIC2.\n\n* **Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis Type 2 (PFIC2)**\n  Many variants in the ABCB11 gene have been found to cause a severe form of liver disease called progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (PFIC2). PFIC2 is a disorder that causes progressive liver disease, which often leads to liver failure. To develop this condition, a person needs to have a disease-causing variant in both copies of the ABCB11 gene.\n  Variants that cause PFIC2 result in either a significant reduction or a complete absence of bile salt transport out of the liver.

The protein essentially flips the phospholipids from the inside to the outside of the cells. The protein then releases the phospholipids into a digestive fluid called bile. Outside the liver cells, in the bile duct, phospholipids attach (bind) to bile acids, which are the component of bile that digests fats. Large amounts of bile acids are potentially harmful to cells. When bile acids are bound to phospholipids, they are less toxic.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nSeveral variants in the ABCB4 gene have been found to cause severe forms of liver disease.\n\n* **Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC3)**\n  * Several variants in the ABCB4 gene have been found to cause a severe form of liver disease called progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3).

ABC transporter proteins carry many types of molecules across membranes in cells.\n\n* The ABCB7 protein is located in the inner membrane of cell structures called mitochondria.\n* Mitochondria are involved in a wide variety of cellular activities, including energy production, chemical signaling, and regulation of cell growth and division.\n* In the mitochondria of developing red blood cells (erythroblasts), the ABCB7 protein plays a critical role in the production of heme. Heme contains iron and is a component of hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in the blood.\n\nThe ABCB7 protein is also involved in the formation of certain proteins containing clusters of iron and sulfur atoms (Fe-S clusters). Researchers suspect that the ABCB7 protein transports Fe-S clusters from mitochondria, where they are formed, to the surrounding cellular fluid (cytosol), where they can be incorporated into proteins. Overall, researchers believe that the ABCB7 protein helps maintain an appropriate balance of iron (iron homeostasis) in developing red blood cells.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia: At least three mutations in the ABCB7 gene have been identified in people with this condition.\n* Each of these mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the ABCB7 protein, slightly altering its structure. These changes disrupt the protein's usual role in heme production and iron homeostasis.\n* Anemia results when heme cannot be produced normally, and therefore not enough hemoglobin is made. It is unclear how changes in the ABCB7 gene lead to problems with coordination and balance (ataxia) and other movement abnormalities.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* No information available.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* No information available.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n* No information available.\n\n---\n\n**ABCB7 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\nThe ABCB7 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 7, which is involved in heme production and iron homeostasis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is the Function of the ABCB7 Gene?**\n\nThe ABCB7 gene plays a crucial role in producing heme, a component of hemoglobin that carries oxygen in the blood.

This protein is found primarily in the liver and kidneys, with small amounts in other tissues such as the skin, stomach, blood vessels, and eyes. The MRP6 protein belongs to a group of proteins that transport molecules across cell membranes; however, little is known about the substances transported by MRP6.\n\n* Some studies suggest that MRP6 stimulates the release of a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from cells through an unknown mechanism.\n* This ATP is quickly broken down into other molecules called adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate. Pyrophosphate helps control deposition of calcium (calcification) and other minerals (mineralization) in the body.\n* Other studies suggest that MRP6 transports a substance that is involved in the breakdown of ATP. This unidentified substance is thought to help prevent mineralization of tissues.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nGeneralized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) is a life-threatening disorder characterized by abnormal calcification in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the arteries).

  "091bbe112d097926427a12fe6157499b": "**ABCC8 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe ABCC8 gene provides instructions for making the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) protein. The SUR1 protein is one part (subunit) of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channel that is found across cell membranes in the beta cells of the pancreas. Beta cells secrete insulin, which is a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels. Insulin controls how much sugar (in the form of glucose) is passed from the bloodstream into cells to be used as energy. The K-ATP channel controls the secretion of insulin out of beta cells and into the bloodstream. These channels open and close in response to the amount of glucose in the bloodstream, which helps regulate insulin secretion and control blood glucose levels. The closing of the channels results in a process that triggers insulin secretion by beta cells.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Congenital Hyperinsulinism**\n  More than 300 mutations in the ABCC8 gene have been found to cause congenital hyperinsulinism. This condition causes frequent episodes of low blood glucose (hypoglycemia), decreased energy, and irritability. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SUR1 protein.\n  Some ABCC8 mutations prevent the SUR1 protein from reaching the cell membrane, interfering with the proper formation of the K-ATP channel. Other mutations interfere with the K-ATP channel's function or its responses to outside molecules. Defective K-ATP channels lead to the constant release of insulin from beta cells. As a result, glucose is rapidly removed from the bloodstream. Without treatment, the hypoglycemia caused by congenital hyperinsulinism may result in serious complications such as intellectual disability and seizures.\n\n* **Permanent Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus**\n  At least 14 mutations in the ABCC8 gene have been identified in people with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus. Individuals with this condition often have a low birth weight and develop increased blood sugar (hyperglycemia) within the first 6 months of life.\n  ABCC8 gene mutations that cause permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus change single amino acids in the protein sequence. These mutations result in K-ATP channels that do not close, leading to reduced insulin secretion from beta cells and impaired blood sugar control.\n\n* **Maturity-onset Diabetes of the Young**\n  MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Maturity-onset diabetes of the young\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* \n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* \n\n**References**\n\n*\n\n---\n\n**ABCC8 Gene**\n\n**Diseases Associated with the ABCC8 Gene**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Permanent Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus**\n  At least 14 mutations in the ABCC8 gene have been identified in people with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus. Individuals with this condition often have a low birth weight and develop increased blood sugar (hyperglycemia) within the first 6 months of life.\n  ABCC8 gene mutations that cause permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus change single amino acids in the protein sequence. These mutations result in K-ATP channels that do not close, leading to reduced insulin secretion from beta cells and impaired blood sugar control.\n\n* **Transient Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus**\n  Other ABCC8 gene mutations that have a relatively mild effect on K-ATP channel function as compared to that seen in permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (see above) cause a condition called transient neonatal diabetes mellitus.\n  Infants with this condition have hyperglycemia during the first 6 months of life, but their blood sugar returns to normal by age 18 months. However, affected individuals usually develop hyperglycemia again during adolescence or early adulthood.\n  As in permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus, ABCC8 gene mutations that cause transient neonatal diabetes mellitus interfere with K-ATP channel closure and lead to a reduction in insulin secretion.\n\n* **Congenital Hyperinsulinism**\n  More than 300 mutations in the ABCC8 gene have been found to cause congenital hyperinsulinism. This condition causes frequent episodes of low blood glucose (hypoglycemia), decreased energy, and irritability.\n  Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SUR1 protein.\n  Some ABCC8 mutations prevent the SUR1 protein from reaching the cell membrane, interfering with the proper formation of the K-ATP channel. Other mutations interfere with the K-ATP channel's function or its responses to outside molecules.\n  Defective K-ATP channels lead to the constant release of insulin from beta cells. As a result, glucose is rapidly removed from the bloodstream. Without treatment, the hypoglycemia caused by congenital hyperinsulinism may result in serious complications such as intellectual disability and seizures.\n\n* **Type 2 Diabetes**\n  Some studies suggest that normal variations (polymorphisms) in the ABCC8 gene are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, the most common form of diabetes.\n  Other studies, however, have not found an association between ABCC8 gene variants and type 2 diabetes.\n  People with this disease have hyperglycemia because the body does not respond correctly to the insulin secreted from beta cells.\n  Although changes in the ABCC8 gene may be associated with type 2 diabetes, a combination of lifestyle, genetic, and environmental factors all play a part in determining the risk of this complex disorder.\n\n* **Maturity-onset Diabetes of the Young**\n  MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Maturity-onset diabetes of the young.\n\n---\n\n**ABCC8 Gene**\n\nCategory: Diseases\n\nThe ABCC8 gene provides instructions for making a protein called the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1). This protein is part of a channel in cells that helps regulate the amount of sugar (glucose) in the blood. The channel, known as the ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channel, is found in many types of cells, including those in the pancreas.\n\n**What Is the Function of the ABCC8 Gene?**\n\nThe ABCC8 gene plays a crucial role in regulating insulin secretion and glucose levels in the blood. The protein produced from this gene helps to close the K-ATP channel when glucose levels are high, which allows cells to take up more glucose. When glucose levels are low, the protein helps to open the K-ATP channel, allowing potassium ions to leave the cell and causing it to release insulin.\n\n**What Are the Consequences of ABCC8 Gene Mutations?**\n\nMutations in the ABCC8 gene can lead to various conditions, including:\n\n*   **Permanent Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus**: This is a rare condition characterized by high blood sugar levels from birth. It is caused by mutations that interfere with K-ATP channel closure and lead to a reduction in insulin secretion.\n*   **Transient Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus**: This is a milder form of neonatal diabetes, where infants have high blood sugar levels during the first 6 months of life but return to normal by age 18 months. However, affected individuals often develop hyperglycemia again during adolescence or early adulthood.\n*   **Type 2 Diabetes**: Some studies suggest that variations in the ABCC8 gene may be associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, although other studies have not found a link.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n*   ABC36\n*   ABCC8_HUMAN\n*   ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C (CFTR/MRP), member 8\n*   ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C, member 8\n*   MRP8\n*   SUR\n*   SUR1\n*   TNDM2\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   **Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry**: Tests of ABCC8\n*   **Scientific Articles on PubMed**: PubMed\n*   **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**: ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY C, MEMBER 8; ABCC8\n    DIABETES MELLITUS, TRANSIENT NEONATAL, 2; TNDM2\n*   **Gene and Variant Databases**: NCBI Gene ClinVar\n\n**References**\n\n1.

  "58858e799537615ccc46dd3cca2e8160": "**ABCC9 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe ABCC9 gene provides instructions for making the sulfonylurea receptor 2 (SUR2) protein. This protein forms one part (subunit) of a channel that transports charged atoms of potassium (potassium ions) across cell membranes. Each of these channels consists of eight subunits: four SUR2 proteins and four proteins produced from either the KCNJ8 or KCNJ11 gene. The SUR2 subunits regulate the activity of the channel, determining whether it is open or closed.\n\nChannels made with the SUR2 protein are known as ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channels. The channels open and close in response to the amount of ATP, the cell's main energy source, inside the cell. The resulting transport of potassium ions is part of a complex network of signals that relay chemical messages into and out of cells.\n\nAlthough K-ATP channels are present in cells and tissues throughout the body, the highest levels of SUR2-containing channels are found in skeletal and heart (cardiac) muscle. These channels indirectly help regulate the concentration of calcium ions in cells. This regulation is essential for normal heart function. The function of these channels in other tissues is unclear.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Cantú Syndrome**\n    *   At least 14 mutations in the ABCC9 gene have been found to cause Cantú syndrome, a rare condition characterized by excess hair growth (hypertrichosis), a distinctive facial appearance, and heart defects. Each of the mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the SUR2 protein. These changes likely alter the structure of the protein and its ability to regulate the activity of K-ATP channels. Studies suggest that the abnormal channels are open when they should be closed. However, it is unknown how this problem with potassium channel function leads to excess hair growth, heart defects, and the other features of Cantú syndrome.\n*   **Familial Atrial Fibrillation**\n    *   MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Familial atrial fibrillation\n*   **Familial Dilated Cardiomyopathy**\n    *   MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Familial dilated cardiomyopathy\n\n---\n\n**ABCC9 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nAt least two mutations in the ABCC9 gene have been identified in people with dilated cardiomyopathy, a form of heart disease that enlarges and weakens the cardiac muscle, preventing the heart from pumping blood efficiently. Signs and symptoms of this condition can include an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), shortness of breath, extreme tiredness (fatigue), and swelling of the legs and feet. Research suggests that each mutation changes the structure of the SUR2 protein and disrupts the regulation of the K-ATP channel. Although K-ATP channels appear to play an important role in cardiac muscle, little is known about how malfunctioning channels are related to dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\n**Cantú Syndrome**\n\nAt least 14 mutations in the ABCC9 gene have been found to cause Cantú syndrome, a rare condition characterized by excess hair growth (hypertrichosis), a distinctive facial appearance, and heart defects.

These changes likely alter the structure of the protein and its ability to regulate the activity of K-ATP channels. Studies suggest that the abnormal channels are open when they should be closed.

ALDP is located in the membranes of cell structures called peroxisomes. Peroxisomes are small sacs within cells that process many types of molecules. ALDP brings a group of fats called very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) into peroxisomes, where they are broken down.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy\n    *   More than 650 mutations in the **ABCD1 gene** have been found to cause X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. This condition is characterized by varying degrees of cognitive and movement problems as well as hormone imbalances.\n    *   The mutations that cause X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy prevent the production of any ALDP in about 75 percent of people with this disorder. Other people with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy can produce ALDP, but the protein is not able to perform its normal function.\n    *   With little or no functional ALDP, VLCFAs are not broken down, and they build up in the body. The accumulation of these fats may be toxic to the adrenal glands (small glands on top of each kidney) and to the fatty layer of insulation (myelin) that surrounds many nerves in the body.\n    *   Research suggests that the accumulation of VLCFAs triggers an inflammatory response in the brain, which could lead to the breakdown of myelin.

Urate is a byproduct of certain normal biochemical reactions in the body. In the bloodstream, it acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from the damaging effects of unstable molecules called free radicals. Urate levels are regulated by the kidneys and, to a lesser extent, by the intestines.\n\nThe ABCG2 protein also transports certain drugs out of cells. For example, this protein clears some chemotherapy drugs from organs and tissues. Transport of these drugs allows them to have their intended effects and be eliminated from the body.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n\\n\\n\nGenetic changes in the ABCG2 gene are associated with a condition called **gout**, which is a form of arthritis that causes painful joint inflammation.\n\n*   The ABCG2 gene changes associated with gout decrease the protein's ability to release urate.\n*   One variant replaces the protein building block (amino acid) glutamine with the amino acid lysine at position 141 in the protein (written as Gln141Lys or Q141K). This change reduces the protein's ability to secrete urate by half.\n*   Another variant creates a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the ABCG2 protein (written as Gln126Ter or Q126X), which results in no functional ABCG2 protein.\n\nVariants in the ABCG2 gene reduce the removal of urate from the blood, causing the blood level of urate to rise. The excess urate can accumulate in the body's joints in the form of crystals, triggering an inflammatory response from the immune system and leading to gout.\n\nWhile changes in the ABCG2 gene can alter urate levels in the body, they are not enough to cause gout by themselves.

The other half of the sterolin protein, sterolin-2, is produced from a gene called ABCG8. Sterolin is involved in eliminating plant sterols, which are fatty components of plant-based foods that cannot be used by human cells.\n\nSterolin is a transporter protein, which is a type of protein that moves substances across cell membranes. It is found mostly in cells of the intestines and liver and transports plant sterols. After plant sterols are absorbed from food into intestinal cells, the sterolin transporters in these cells pump them back into the intestinal tract.

This process removes most of the dietary plant sterols, and allows only about 5 percent of these substances to get into the bloodstream.

The other half of the sterolin protein, sterolin-1, is produced from a gene called ABCG5. Sterolin is involved in eliminating plant sterols, which are fatty components of plant-based foods that cannot be used by human cells.\n\nSterolin is a transporter protein, which is a type of protein that moves substances across cell membranes. It is found mostly in cells of the intestines and liver and transports plant sterols.

The ATGL enzyme plays a role in breaking down fats called triglycerides, which are a major source of stored energy in cells. Cells primarily store triglycerides in structures called lipid droplets (also called adiposomes). The ABHD5 protein and the ATGL enzyme are found on the surface of lipid droplets. Once activated, the ATGL enzyme breaks down triglycerides in these structures to provide energy for the body.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nSeveral variants (also called mutations) in the **ABHD5 gene** have been found to cause Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome, a condition in which triglycerides build up in the body.

This leads to uncontrolled growth and division of cells, resulting in cancer.\n\n**Other Cancers Associated with ABL1**\n\n*   Acute leukemias: The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene is also involved in fast-growing blood cell cancers called acute leukemias.\n*   Rarely, translocations that lead to fusion of the ABL1 gene with genes other than BCR are associated with acute leukemias.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n*   Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase 1\n*   ABL bcr/abl\n*   bcr/c-abl oncogene protein c-ABL\n*   c-abl oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase\n*   c-ABL1\n*   JTK7\n*   p150 proto-oncogene\n*   c-Abl proto-oncogene\n*   Tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1 isoform a\n*   Tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1 isoform b\n*   v-abl\n*   Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n    *   Tests of ABL1\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n    *   PubMed\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n    *   ABL PROTOONCOGENE 1, NONRECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASE; ABL1\n    *   LEUKEMIA, ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC; ALL\n*   Gene and Variant Databases:\n    *   NCBI Gene\n    *   ClinVar\n\n**References**\n\n*   Chereda B, Melo JV.

The types are based on small substances (molecules) on the surface of the blood cells.\n\nWhen people who have one blood type receive blood from someone with a different blood type, it may cause their immune system to react. This is called ABO incompatibility.\n\nDue to modern testing techniques, this problem is very rare.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   The different blood types are:\n    *   Type A\n    *   Type B\n    *   Type AB\n    *   Type O\n\nPeople who have one blood type may form proteins (antibodies) that cause their immune system to react against one or more of the other blood types.\n\nBeing exposed to another type of blood can cause a reaction. This is important when someone needs to receive a blood transfusion or have an organ transplant. The blood types must be compatible to avoid an ABO incompatibility reaction.\n\nFor example:\n\n*   People with type A blood will react against type B or type AB blood.\n*   People with type B blood will react against type A or type AB blood.\n*   People with type O blood will react against type A, type B, or type AB blood.\n*   People with type AB blood will not react against type A, type B, type AB, or type O blood.\n\nType O blood does not cause an immune response when it is given to people with type A, type B, or type AB blood. This is why type O blood cells can be given to people of any blood type. People with type O blood are called universal donors. But people with type O can only receive type O blood.\n\nBoth blood and plasma transfusions must be matched to avoid an immune reaction. Before anyone receives blood, both the blood and the person receiving it are tested carefully to avoid a reaction. Usually, a reaction occurs because of a clerical error causing someone to receive incompatible blood.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*   Low back pain\n*   Blood in urine\n*   Chills\n*   Feeling of impending doom\n*   Fever\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Increased heart rate\n*   Pain at infusion site\n*   Chest pain\n*   Dizziness\n*   Bronchospasm (spasm of the muscles lining the lung; causes cough)\n*   Yellow skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n*   Acute kidney failure\n*   Low blood pressure\n*   Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam.

Treatment may also include:\n\n*   Medicines used to treat allergic reactions (antihistamines)\n*   Medicines used to treat swelling and allergies (steroids)\n*   Fluids given through a vein (intravenously)\n*   Medicines to raise blood pressure if it drops too low\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nABO incompatibility can be a very serious problem that can result in death.

  "3965b804042a8dac2ebe103fb07a0d82": "**ACAD8 Gene**\n\n**Category:** diseases\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe ACAD8 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IBD). This enzyme is found in mitochondria, the energy-producing centers inside cells. The IBD enzyme is involved in breaking down proteins from food. Specifically, this enzyme is responsible for the third step in the breakdown of a protein building block (amino acid) called valine. The IBD enzyme converts a molecule called isobutyryl-CoA into a molecule called methacrylyl-CoA. Other enzymes further break down methacrylyl-CoA into molecules that cells can use for energy.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nIsobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency\n\n* Variants (also called mutations) in the ACAD8 gene have been found to cause IBD deficiency. People with IBD deficiency cannot effectively break down valine.\n* Normally, proteins from food are broken down into amino acids, which are further processed to provide energy for growth and development. IBD deficiency disrupts this process.\n* Most people with IBD deficiency do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition. If signs or symptoms do appear, they typically show up early in life and only last for a short period of time.\n* The ACAD8 gene variants that cause IBD deficiency reduce or eliminate the activity of the IBD enzyme. As a result, isobutyryl-CoA is not converted to methacrylyl-CoA and the breakdown of valine is impaired. An inability to process valine may reduce energy production, and some people may develop health problems related to IBD deficiency.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* ACAD-8\n* ACAD8_HUMAN\n* Activator-recruited cofactor 42 kDa component\n* acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family, member 8\n* acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase 8\n* ARC42\n* FLJ22590\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n  * Tests of ACAD8\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n  * PubMed\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n  * ACYL-CoA DEHYDROGENASE FAMILY, MEMBER 8; ACAD8\n\n---\n\n**ACAD8 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Gene and Variant Databases**\n\n*   **NCBI Gene**\n*   **ClinVar**\n\n**Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry**\n\n*   **Tests of ACAD8**\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   **PubMed**\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   **ACYL-CoA DEHYDROGENASE FAMILY, MEMBER 8; ACAD8**\n\n**Genomic Location**\n\nThe ACAD8 gene is found on chromosome 11.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   **Genes and Gene Therapy**\n*   **Genetic Disorders**\n\n**References**\n\n1.

  "95422876ae88d924765d65fc90a71099": "**ACAD9 Deficiency**\n\n**Description**\n\\n\\n\nACAD9 deficiency is a condition that varies in severity and can cause muscle weakness (myopathy), heart problems, and intellectual disability. Nearly all affected individuals have a buildup of a chemical called lactic acid in the body (lactic acidosis). Additional signs and symptoms that affect other body systems occur in rare cases.\n\n* Mildly affected individuals with ACAD9 deficiency usually experience nausea and extreme fatigue in response to physical activity (exercise intolerance).\n* People with ACAD9 deficiency who are moderately affected have low muscle tone (hypotonia) and weakness in the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles).\n* Severely affected individuals have brain dysfunction combined with myopathy (encephalomyopathy); these individuals usually also have an enlarged and weakened heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), which is typically fatal in infancy or childhood.\n* Individuals with ACAD9 deficiency who survive past early childhood often have intellectual disability and may develop seizures. Rare signs and symptoms of ACAD9 deficiency include movement disorders and problems with liver and kidney function.\n\nSome individuals with ACAD9 deficiency have had improvement in muscle strength and a reduction in lactic acid levels with treatment.\n\n**Frequency**\n\\n\\n\nThe prevalence of ACAD9 deficiency is unknown. At least 25 people with this condition have been described in the scientific literature.\n\n**Causes**\n\\n\\n\nACAD9 deficiency is caused by mutations in the ACAD9 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is critical in helping assemble a group of proteins known as complex I. Complex I is found in mitochondria, which are the energy-producing structures inside cells. Complex I is one of several complexes that carry out a multistep process called oxidative phosphorylation, through which cells derive much of their energy.\n\nThe ACAD9 enzyme also plays a role in fatty acid oxidation, a multistep process that occurs within mitochondria to break down (metabolize) fats and convert them into energy.\n\n---\n\n**ACAD9 Deficiency**\n\n**Category:** diseases\n\nThe ACAD9 enzyme helps metabolize a certain group of fats called long-chain fatty acids. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods without food (fasting), fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.\n\nSome ACAD9 gene mutations disrupt complex I assembly as well as long-chain fatty acid oxidation, while others affect only complex I assembly. The mutations that affect both of the enzyme's functions tend to be associated with the most severe signs and symptoms of ACAD9 deficiency, such as encephalomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\nAlthough the exact mechanism is unclear, it is likely that cells that are less able to produce energy die off, particularly cells in the brain, skeletal muscle, and other tissues and organs that require a lot of energy. The loss of cells in these tissues is thought to lead to the signs and symptoms of ACAD9 deficiency.\n\n**Causes**\n\nACAD9 deficiency is caused by mutations in the ACAD9 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is critical in helping assemble a group of proteins known as complex I. Complex I is found in mitochondria, which are the energy-producing structures inside cells.\n\nThe ACAD9 enzyme also plays a role in fatty acid oxidation, a multistep process that occurs within mitochondria to break down (metabolize) fats and convert them into energy. The ACAD9 enzyme helps metabolize a certain group of fats called long-chain fatty acids.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n* **Other Names for This Condition:**\n  * Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 9 deficiency\n  * Deficiency of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family member 9\n  * Mitochondrial complex I deficiency due to ACAD9 deficiency\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* **Genetic Testing Information:**\n  * Genetic Testing Registry: Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 9 deficiency\n* **Patient Support and Advocacy Resources:**\n  * National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:**\n  * MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 20; MC1DN20\n\n---\n\n**ACAD9 Deficiency**\n\n**What is ACAD9 deficiency?**\n\nACAD9 deficiency is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ACAD9 gene. This condition affects the production of energy within cells, leading to various symptoms and complications.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nACAD9 deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition. The risk factors for ACAD9 deficiency include:\n\n*   Family history: Having a family member with ACAD9 deficiency increases the risk.\n*   Genetic mutations: Mutations in the ACAD9 gene can cause the condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms and Complications**\n\nThe symptoms of ACAD9 deficiency can vary depending on the individual, but common complications include:\n\n*   Muscle weakness\n*   Fatigue\n*   Lactic acidosis (buildup of lactic acid in the blood)\n*   Cardiac hypertrophy (enlargement of the heart muscle)\n*   Exercise intolerance\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nACAD9 deficiency can be diagnosed through various tests, including:\n\n*   Genetic testing: Identifying mutations in the ACAD9 gene\n*   Blood tests: Measuring lactic acid levels and other biomarkers\n*   Imaging studies: Evaluating heart function and muscle strength\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment and Management**\n\nThere is no cure for ACAD9 deficiency, but various treatments can help manage symptoms and complications. These may include:\n\n*   Riboflavin supplements: To improve energy production within cells\n*   Exercise therapy: To improve muscle strength and endurance\n*   Cardiac medications: To manage cardiac hypertrophy\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with ACAD9 deficiency varies depending on the severity of symptoms and complications. Some people may experience mild symptoms, while others may have more severe complications.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n*   Aintablian HK, Narayanan V, Belnap N, Ramsey K, Grebe TA.

It leads to complex I deficiency, which affects the mitochondria's ability to produce energy.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Related Health Topics:**\n\n* Genetic Disorders\n* Mitochondrial Diseases\n\n\\n\\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\nThe prognosis of a genetic condition depends on various factors, including the severity of the disorder and the effectiveness of treatment. Gene variants can affect health and development in different ways, such as by causing birth defects or increasing the risk of certain diseases.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Inheritance Patterns:**\n\n* ACAD9 deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition.\n* Carriers of the mutated gene may not exhibit symptoms but can pass the gene to their offspring.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Treatment and Management:**\n\nWhile there is no cure for ACAD9 deficiency, treatment options are available to manage its symptoms. These may include dietary changes, medication, and physical therapy to improve muscle strength and mobility.\n\n\\n\\n\n**References:**\n\n* \"Mitochondrial complex I deficiency as key manifestation of novel compound heterozygous ACAD9 mutations.\" (2017) Neuromuscul Disord, 27(5), 473-476. doi: 10.1016/j.nmd.2017.02.005.

The ACAD9 enzyme is critical in helping assemble a group of proteins known as complex I. Complex I is one of several complexes that carry out a multistep process called oxidative phosphorylation, through which cells derive much of their energy.\n\nThe ACAD9 enzyme also plays a role in fatty acid oxidation, a multistep process that occurs within mitochondria to break down (metabolize) fats and convert them into energy. The ACAD9 enzyme helps metabolize two fats called palmitate and oleate, which belong to a certain group of fats called long-chain fatty acids. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods without food (fasting), fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nACAD9 deficiency is caused by at least 30 ACAD9 gene mutations. This condition varies in severity and can cause muscle weakness (myopathy), heart problems, intellectual disability, and other signs and symptoms. Most ACAD9 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ACAD9 enzyme.\n\n* Some mutations disrupt only complex I assembly.\n* Decreased complex I formation can impair oxidative phosphorylation and reduce the amount of energy available in the cell.\n* Other mutations affect the ACAD9 enzyme's structure or stability and likely disrupt both complex I assembly and long-chain fatty acid oxidation. A reduction in both of these energy production processes tends to be associated with the most severe signs and symptoms of ACAD9 deficiency.\n\nAlthough the exact mechanism that causes the signs and symptoms of ACAD9 deficiency is unclear, it is likely that cells that are less able to produce energy die off, particularly cells in the brain, skeletal muscle, and other tissues and organs that require a lot of energy.

Normally, the body breaks down proteins from food into smaller parts called amino acids. Amino acids can be further processed to provide energy for the body. In cells throughout the body, SBCAD is found within specialized structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria convert energy from food into a form that cells can use.\n\nThe SBCAD enzyme helps break down a particular amino acid called isoleucine. Specifically, this enzyme helps with the third step of the process, performing a chemical reaction that converts a molecule called 2-methylbutyryl-CoA to another molecule, tiglyl-CoA. Additional chemical reactions convert tiglyl-CoA into molecules that are used for energy. Through similar chemical reactions, the SBCAD enzyme also aids in the breakdown of other amino acids.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   Short/branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency\n    *   Researchers have identified more than 10 ACADSB gene mutations in people with short/branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SBCAD) deficiency.

Other mutations lead to an abnormally small version of this enzyme that is missing several amino acids. As a result of these mutations, SBCAD has little or no activity. With a shortage (deficiency) of normal enzyme activity, the body is unable to break down isoleucine properly.\n    *   Researchers speculate that some features of this disorder, such as lethargy and muscle weakness, occur because isoleucine is not converted to energy.

This enzyme functions within mitochondria, the energy-producing centers in cells.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nVery long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is essential for fatty acid oxidation, which is the multistep process that breaks down (metabolizes) fats and converts them to energy. Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is required to break down a group of fats called very long-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids are found in food and body fat. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods without food (fasting), fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency\n\nVariants (also known as mutations) in the **ACADVL gene** have been found to cause very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency. Many of these variants change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the VLCAD enzyme. Other variants delete part of the ACADVL gene or create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making VLCAD. These variants lead to a change in the enzyme's structure, severely reducing or eliminating its activity.\n\nAs a result, very little functional enzyme is produced. With a shortage (deficiency) of functional VLCAD enzyme, very-long chain fatty acids are not broken down properly.  As a result, these fats are not converted to energy, which can lead to signs and symptoms of this disorder such as the lack of energy (lethargy) and low blood glucose (hypoglycemia). Very long-chain fatty acids or partially metabolized fatty acids may build up in tissues and damage the heart, liver, and muscles. This abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of VLCAD deficiency.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* Not specified\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Not specified\n\n**References**\n\n* Not specified\n\n---\n\n**ACADVL Gene**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nThe ACADVL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD).

Aggrecan is a type of protein known as a proteoglycan, which means it has several sugar molecules attached to it. It is the most abundant proteoglycan in cartilage, a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone (a process called ossification), except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose, airways, and external ears.\n\n* Aggrecan attaches to the other components of cartilage, organizing the network of molecules that gives cartilage its strength.\n* These interactions occur at a specific region of the aggrecan protein called the C-type lectin domain (CLD).\n* Because of the attached sugars, aggrecan attracts water molecules and gives cartilage its gel-like structure. This feature enables the cartilage to resist compression, protecting bones and joints.\n* Although its role is unclear, aggrecan affects bone development.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nAt least one variant (also known as a mutation) in the ACAN gene has been found to cause familial osteochondritis dissecans. This condition is characterized by areas of bone damage (lesions) caused by the detachment of cartilage and some of the underlying bone from the end of the bone at a joint.\n\n* People with familial osteochondritis dissecans have multiple lesions that affect the knees, elbows, hips, or ankles.\n* Other common features are short stature and early development of a painful joint disorder called osteoarthritis.\n\nThe ACAN gene variant associated with this condition changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the CLD of the aggrecan protein. Specifically, the amino acid valine is replaced by the amino acid methionine at protein position 2303 (written as Val2303Met or V2303M).

As a result, the cartilage is disorganized and weak.\n\n* It is unclear how the abnormal cartilage is involved in the development of the lesions and osteoarthritis characteristic of familial osteochondritis dissecans.\n* Researchers have suggested that a disorganized cartilage network in growing bones impairs their growth, leading to short stature.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* No information available\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* No information available\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n* No information available\n\n---\n\n**ACAN Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nTwo other conditions associated with short stature are caused by variants in the ACAN gene:\n\n*   **Spondyloepimetaphyseal Dysplasia, Aggrecan Type**\n    *   People have extremely short stature, short fingers and toes, and distinctive facial features.\n    *   This condition is caused by a variant that changes the amino acid at position 2267 in the aggrecan protein from aspartic acid to asparagine (written as Asp2267Asn or D2267N).\n    *   The amino acid change alters aggrecan's interaction with at least one component of the cartilage network.\n*   **Spondyloepiphyseal Dysplasia, Kimberley Type**\n    *   Characterized by short stature and early development of osteoarthritis, particularly in the knees, ankles, and hips.\n    *   This condition is caused by a variant in which a single DNA building block is inserted into the ACAN gene.\n    *   The abnormal protein may be produced or have unknown effects.\n\n**Familial Osteochondritis Dissecans**\n\nAt least one variant (also known as a mutation) in the ACAN gene has been found to cause familial osteochondritis dissecans.

This enzyme is able to cut (cleave) proteins. It is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure and the balance of fluids and salts in the body.\n\n* By cutting a protein called angiotensin I at a particular location, the angiotensin-converting enzyme converts this protein to angiotensin II.\n* Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to narrow (constrict), which results in increased blood pressure.\n* This protein also stimulates production of the hormone aldosterone, which triggers the absorption of salt and water by the kidneys.\n* The increased amount of fluid in the body also increases blood pressure.\n* Proper blood pressure during fetal growth, which delivers oxygen to the developing tissues, is required for normal development of the kidneys, particularly of structures called the proximal tubules, and other tissues.\n* In addition, angiotensin II may play a more direct role in kidney development, perhaps by affecting growth factors involved in the development of kidney structures.\n\nThe angiotensin-converting enzyme can cleave other proteins, including bradykinin. Bradykinin causes blood vessels to widen (dilate), which decreases blood pressure. Cleavage by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inactivates bradykinin, helping to increase blood pressure.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Renal tubular dysgenesis: Mutations in the ACE gene are the most common cause of a severe kidney disorder called renal tubular dysgenesis; at least 33 ACE gene mutations have been found in people with this disorder.\n* Characteristics:\n\t+ Abnormal kidney development before birth\n\t+ Inability to produce urine (anuria)\n\t+ Severe low blood pressure (hypotension)\n\n---\n\n**ACE Gene**\n\nThe ACE gene plays a crucial role in the renin-angiotensin system, which helps regulate blood pressure. Mutations in the ACE gene can lead to severe kidney disorders.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Renal Tubular Dysgenesis**\n\n*   Characterized by abnormal kidney development before birth\n*   Inability to produce urine (anuria)\n*   Severe low blood pressure (hypotension)\n\nThese problems result in a reduction of amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios), leading to a set of birth defects known as the Potter sequence.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Renal Tubular Dysgenesis**\n\nMutations in both copies of any of the genes involved in the renin-angiotensin system can cause renal tubular dysgenesis. The ACE gene mutations that cause this disorder prevent the production of functional angiotensin-converting enzyme, impairing the formation of angiotensin II and resulting in a nonfunctional renin-angiotensin system.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Effects of Renal Tubular Dysgenesis**\n\nWithout a functioning renin-angiotensin system, the kidneys cannot control blood pressure. Low blood pressure reduces the flow of blood (hypoperfusion), leading to inadequate oxygen supply during fetal development. This impairs kidney development, resulting in the features of renal tubular dysgenesis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Disorders Associated with ACE Gene**\n\nA certain variation in the ACE gene has been associated with increased risk of several conditions, including:\n\n*   Stroke\n*   Complications of diabetes\n\nThis genetic variation, called the ACE I/D polymorphism, involves a region of DNA that spans 287 DNA building blocks (nucleotides). The DD pattern is associated with higher levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme than the II pattern. People with the DD pattern of alleles have an increased risk of stroke and developing diabetic nephropathy in people with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**ACE I/D Polymorphism**\n\n*   The ACE gene includes this region; it is called the insertion, or I, allele.\n*   Another variant is missing this region of DNA and is called the deletion, or D, allele.\n*   Each individual can have two I alleles (II), two D alleles (DD), or one allele of each (ID).\n\n---\n\n**ACE Gene**\n\nThe ACE gene is responsible for producing the angiotensin-converting enzyme, which plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure and fluid balance in the body.\n\n**What are the variants of the ACE gene?**\n\n*   The ACE gene has two main variants:\n    *   **Insertion (I) allele**: This variant includes a region of DNA that spans 287 nucleotides.\n    *   **Deletion (D) allele**: This variant is missing this region of DNA.\n\n**How do these variants affect the levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme?**\n\n*   People with two D alleles (DD pattern) have higher levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme than those with two I alleles (II pattern).\n*   Those with one allele of each (ID pattern) have intermediate levels.\n\n**Association with diseases**\n\n*   The DD pattern is associated with an increased risk of stroke, which can be caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain (ischemic stroke) or bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage).\n*   In people with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes, the DD pattern is associated with an increased risk of developing diabetic nephropathy, a kidney disorder that can lead to kidney failure.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n*   ACE1\n*   ACE_HUMAN\n*   Angiotensin converting enzyme, somatic isoform\n*   Angiotensin I converting enzyme (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) 1\n*   Angiotensin I converting enzyme peptidyl-dipeptidase A 1 transcript\n*   Angiotensin-converting enzyme\n*   CD143\n*   CD143 antigen\n*   DCP\n*   DCP1\n*   Dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase 1\n*   Dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase I\n*   EC 3.4.15.1\n*   ICH\n*   Kininase II\n*   MVCD3\n\n**References**\n\n*   Gribouval O, Gonzales M, Neuhaus T, Aziza J, Bieth E, Laurent N, Bouton JM, Feuillet F, Makni S, Ben Amar H, Laube G, Delezoide AL, Bouvier R, Dijoud F, Ollagnon-Roman E, Roume J, Joubert M, Antignac C, Gubler MC.

  "bac4656eb55d5284dcb5f9232fe44fd1": "**ACL Reconstruction - Discharge**\n\nYou had surgery to repair a damaged ligament in your knee called the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). This article tells you how to care for yourself when you go home from the hospital.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When You're in the Hospital**\n\nYou had surgery to reconstruct your anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The surgeon drilled sockets and tunnels in the bones of your knee and attached the new ligament to the bone. You may also have had surgery to repair other tissue in your knee.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nYou may need help taking care of yourself when you first go home. Plan for a spouse, friend, or neighbor to help you. It can take from a few days to a few months to be ready to return to work. How soon you return to work will depend on the kind of work you do. It often takes 4 to 6 months to return to your full level of activity and take part in sports again after surgery.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Activity**\n\n* Keep your leg propped up on 1 or 2 pillows. Place the pillows under your foot or calf muscle. This helps keep swelling down.\n* Do this 4 to 6 times a day for the first week after surgery.\n* Do not put the pillow behind your knee. Keep your knee straight.\n* Be careful not to get the dressing on your knee wet.\n* Do not use a heating pad.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Using Crutches and Knee Brace**\n\nYou will need to use crutches when you go home. You may be able to begin putting your full weight on your repaired leg without crutches 2 to 3 weeks after surgery, if your surgeon says it is OK. If you had work on your knee in addition to ACL reconstruction, it may take 4 to 8 weeks to regain full use of your knee.\n\n* Ask your surgeon how long you will need to be on crutches.\n* You may also need to wear a special knee brace. The brace will be set so that your knee can move only a certain amount in any direction.\n* Do not change the settings on the brace yourself.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Physical Therapy**\n\nPhysical therapy most often begins about 1 to 2 weeks after surgery, however you can do some simple postoperative knee exercises immediately after surgery. The duration of physical therapy may be 2 to 6 months.\n\n* You will need to limit your activity and movement while your knee mends.\n* Your physical therapist will give you an exercise program to help you build strength in your knee and avoid injury.\n* Staying active and building strength in the muscles of your legs will help speed your recovery.\n* Getting full range of motion in your leg soon after surgery is also important.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Wound Care**\n\nYou will go home with a dressing and an elastic bandage around your knee. Do not remove them until the surgeon says it is OK.\n\n* Keep the dressing and bandage clean and dry.\n* You can shower again after your dressing is removed.\n* When you shower, wrap your leg in plastic to keep it from getting wet until your stitches or tape strips (Steri-Strips) have been removed.\n* Make sure that your surgeon says this is OK.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Pain**\n\nPain is normal after knee arthroscopy. It should ease up over time.\n\n* Your surgeon will give you a prescription for pain medicine before your surgery.\n* Get it filled ahead of time so that you have it when you need it.\n* Take your pain medicine when you start having pain so the pain doesn't get too bad.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your surgeon if:\n\n* Blood is soaking through your dressing, and the bleeding does not stop when you put pressure on the area\n* Pain does not go away after you take pain medicine\n* You have swelling or pain in your calf muscle\n* Your foot or toes look darker than normal or are cool to the touch\n* You have redness, pain, swelling, or yellowish discharge from your incisions\n* You have a temperature higher than 101°F (38.3°C)\n\n---\n\n**ACL Reconstruction - Discharge**\n\n**Category:** General\n\n**Activity**\n\nAfter surgery, it takes 4 to 6 months to return to your full level of activity and participate in sports again.\n\n* Keep your leg propped up on 1 or 2 pillows when you first go home. Place the pillows under your foot or calf muscle to help keep swelling down.\n* Do this 4 to 6 times a day for the first week after surgery.\n* Be careful not to get the dressing on your knee wet.\n* Do not use a heating pad.\n\nYou may need to wear special support stockings to help prevent blood clots from forming. Your surgeon will also give you exercises to keep the blood moving in your foot, ankle, and leg. These exercises will also lower your risk for blood clots.\n\n* You will need to use crutches when you go home.\n* You may be able to begin putting your full weight on your repaired leg without crutches 2 to 3 weeks after surgery, if your surgeon says it is OK.\n* If you had work on your knee in addition to ACL reconstruction, it may take 4 to 8 weeks to regain full use of your knee. Ask your surgeon how long you will need to be on crutches.\n\nYou may also need to wear a special knee brace. The brace will be set so that your knee can move only a certain amount in any direction. Do not change the settings on the brace yourself.\n\n* When the brace is off for any reason, be careful not to move your knee more than you can when you have the brace on.\n* Ask your surgeon or physical therapist about sleeping without the brace and removing it for showers.\n\nYou will need to learn how to go up and down stairs using crutches or with a knee brace on.\n\n**Physical Therapy**\n\nPhysical therapy most often begins about 1 to 2 weeks after surgery, however you can do some simple postoperative knee exercises immediately after surgery. The duration of physical therapy may be 2 to 6 months.\n\n* You will need to limit your activity and movement while your knee mends.\n* Your physical therapist will give you an exercise program to help you build strength in your knee and avoid injury.\n* Staying active and building strength in the muscles of your legs will help speed your recovery.\n* Getting full range of motion in your leg soon after surgery is also important.\n\n**Wound Care**\n\nYou will go home with a dressing and an elastic bandage around your knee. Do not remove them until the surgeon says it is OK.\n\n* Keep the dressing and bandage clean and dry.\n* You can shower again after your dressing is removed.\n* When you shower, wrap your leg in plastic to keep it from getting wet until your stitches or tape strips (Steri-Strips) have been removed.\n* Make sure that your surgeon says this is OK.\n\nIf you need to change your dressing for any reason, put the elastic bandage back on over the new dressing. Wrap the elastic bandage loosely around your knee. Start from the calf and wrap it around your leg and knee. Do not wrap it too tightly.\n\n**Pain**\n\nPain is normal after knee arthroscopy. It should ease up over time.\n\n* Your surgeon will give you a prescription for pain medicine before your surgery.\n* Get it filled ahead of time so that you have it when you need it.\n* Take your pain medicine when you start having pain so the pain doesn't get too bad.\n* You may have received a nerve block during surgery, so that your nerves do not feel pain. It is normal that your leg will feel a bit numb after the nerve block.\n* The numbness can last for hours and sometimes up to a day.\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your surgeon if:\n\n* Blood is soaking through your dressing, and the bleeding does not stop when you put pressure on the area\n* Pain does not go away after you take pain medicine\n* You have swelling or pain in your calf muscle\n* Your foot or toes look darker than normal or are cool to the touch\n* You have redness, pain, swelling, or yellowish discharge from your incisions\n* You have a temperature higher than 101°F (38.3°C)\n\n---\n\n**ACL Reconstruction - Discharge**\n\n\\n\\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nYou may need help taking care of yourself when you first go home. Plan for a spouse, friend, or neighbor to help you. It can take from a few days to a few months to be ready to return to work. How soon you return to work will depend on the kind of work you do. It often takes 4 to 6 months to return to your full level of activity and take part in sports again after surgery.\n\n**Activity**\n\n* Keep your leg propped up on 1 or 2 pillows. Place the pillows under your foot or calf muscle. This helps keep swelling down.\n* Do this 4 to 6 times a day for the first week after surgery.\n* Be careful not to get the dressing on your knee wet.\n* Do not use a heating pad.\n\nYou may need to wear special support stockings to help prevent blood clots from forming. Your surgeon will also give you exercises to keep the blood moving in your foot, ankle, and leg. These exercises will also lower your risk for blood clots.\n\n* You will need to use crutches when you go home.\n* You may be able to begin putting your full weight on your repaired leg without crutches 2 to 3 weeks after surgery, if your surgeon says it is OK.\n* If you had work on your knee in addition to ACL reconstruction, it may take 4 to 8 weeks to regain full use of your knee. Ask your surgeon how long you will need to be on crutches.\n\nYou may also need to wear a special knee brace. The brace will be set so that your knee can move only a certain amount in any direction. Do not change the settings on the brace yourself.\n\n* The brace is usually locked when you are using crutches when walking for the first few weeks.\n* You can unlock to work on range of motion if it's OK with your surgeon\n* Ask your surgeon or physical therapist about sleeping without the brace and removing it for showers.\n* When the brace is off for any reason, be careful not to move your knee more than you can when you have the brace on.\n\nYou will need to learn how to go up and down stairs using crutches or with a knee brace on.\n\n**Physical Therapy**\n\n* Physical therapy most often begins about 1 to 2 weeks after surgery.\n* However, you can do some simple postoperative knee exercises immediately after surgery.\n* The duration of physical therapy may be 2 to 6 months.\n* You will need to limit your activity and movement while your knee mends. Your physical therapist will give you an exercise program to help you build strength in your knee and avoid injury.\n\n**Staying Active**\n\n* Staying active and building strength in the muscles of your legs will help speed your recovery.\n* Getting full range of motion in your leg soon after surgery is also important.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Wound Care**\n\nYou will go home with a dressing and an elastic bandage around your knee. Do not remove them until the surgeon says it is OK. Until then, keep the dressing and bandage clean and dry.\n\n* You can shower again after your dressing is removed.\n\n---\n\n**ACL Reconstruction - Discharge**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Wound Care**\n\nYou will go home with a dressing and an elastic bandage around your knee. Do not remove them until the surgeon says it is OK. Until then, keep the dressing and bandage clean and dry.\n\nYou can shower again after your dressing is removed.\n\nWhen you shower, wrap your leg in plastic to keep it from getting wet until your stitches or tape strips (Steri-Strips) have been removed. Make sure that your surgeon says this is OK.\nAfter that, you may get the incisions wet when you shower. Be sure to dry the area well.\n\nIf you need to change your dressing for any reason, put the elastic bandage back on over the new dressing. Wrap the elastic bandage loosely around your knee. Start from the calf and wrap it around your leg and knee. Do not wrap it too tightly.

It is normal that your leg will feel a bit numb after the nerve block. The numbness can last for hours and sometimes up to a day. Make sure you take your pain medicine, even when the block is working. The block will wear off, and pain can return very quickly.\n\nIbuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or another medicine like it may also help. Ask your surgeon or health care provider what other medicines are safe to take with your pain medicine.\n\nDo not drive if you are taking narcotic pain medicine. This medicine may make you too sleepy to drive safely.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Call the Doctor**\n\nContact your surgeon if:\n\n* Blood is soaking through your dressing, and the bleeding does not stop when you put pressure on the area\n* Pain does not go away after you take pain medicine\n* You have swelling or pain in your calf muscle\n* Your foot or toes look darker than normal or are cool to the touch\n* You have redness, pain, swelling, or yellowish discharge from your incisions\n* You have a temperature higher than 101°F (38.3°C)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nAnterior cruciate ligament reconstruction - discharge\n\n---\n\n**ACL Reconstruction - Discharge**\n\n**What to Expect at Home**\n\nAfter an ACL reconstruction, you will need to rest and recover for several weeks.

The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) connects your shin bone (tibia) to your thigh bone (femur). A tear of this ligament can cause your knee to give way during physical activity, most often during side-step or crossover movements.\n\n**Description**\n\nMost people have general anesthesia right before surgery. This means you will be asleep and pain-free. Other kinds of anesthesia, like regional anesthesia or a block, may also be used for this surgery.\n\nThe tissue to replace your damaged ACL will come from your own body or from a donor. A donor is a person who has died and chose to give all or part of their body to help others.\n\n* Tissue taken from your own body is called an autograft.\n* The most common places to take tissue from are the knee cap tendon, quadriceps tendon, or hamstring tendon.\n* Your hamstrings are the muscles behind your knee.\n* Tissue taken from a donor is called an allograft or cadaver graft.\n\n**The Procedure**\n\nThe procedure is usually performed with the help of knee arthroscopy. With arthroscopy, a tiny camera is inserted into the knee through a small surgical cut. The camera is connected to a video monitor in the operating room. Your surgeon will use the camera to check the ligaments and other tissues of your knee.\n\nYour surgeon will make other small cuts around your knee and insert other medical instruments. Your surgeon will fix any other damage found, and then will replace your ACL by following these steps:\n\n* The torn ligament will be removed with a shaver or other instruments.\n* If your own tissue is being used to make your new ACL, your surgeon will make a larger cut. Then, the autograft will be removed through this cut.\n* Your surgeon will make tunnels and sockets in your bone through which to bring the new tissue. This new tissue will be put at the same place as your old ACL.\n* Your surgeon will attach the new ligament to the bone with screws or other devices to hold it in place. As it heals, the graft will remodel to become your new ligament.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nACL reconstruction may be used for these knee problems:\n\n* Knee that gives way or feels unstable during daily activities\n* Knee pain\n* Inability to return to sports or other activities\n* When other ligaments are also injured\n* When your meniscus is torn\n\n**Risks**\n\nThe risks from any anesthesia are:\n\n* Allergic reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n\nThe risks from any surgery are:\n\n* Bleeding\n* Infection\n\nOther risks from this surgery may include:\n\n* Blood clot in the leg\n* Failure of the ligament to heal\n* Failure of the surgery to relieve symptoms\n* Injury to a nearby blood vessel\n* Pain in the knee\n* Stiffness of the knee or lost range of motion\n* Weakness of the knee\n\n**Before Surgery**\n\nAlways tell your provider what medicines you are taking, even medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n\nDuring the 2 weeks before your surgery:\n\n* You may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot.\n* Ask your provider which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\n* If you have diabetes, heart disease, or other medical conditions, your surgeon will ask you to see the provider who treats you for these conditions.\n* Tell your provider if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 drink per day for women or 2 drinks per day for men.\n* If you smoke, try to stop. Smoking can slow down wound and bone healing.\n\n**After Surgery**\n\nMost people can go home the day of the surgery. You may have to wear a knee brace for the first 1 to 6 weeks. You also may need crutches for 1 to 6 weeks. How long you will need to use a crutch and brace will depend on the type of surgery you had and the extent of the reconstruction.\n\n**Recovery**\n\nPhysical therapy can help many people regain motion and strength in their knee. Therapy can last up to 4 to 6 months.\n\nHow soon you return to work will depend on the kind of work you do. It can be from a few days to a few months. A full return to activities and sports will often take 4 to 6 months. Sports that involve quick changes in direction, such as soccer, basketball, and football, may require up to 9 to 12 months of rehabilitation.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost people will have a stable knee that does not give way after ACL reconstruction.

  "47af6f5d8b6c399c4d97c1261f646261": "**ACOX1 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\nThe ACOX1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called peroxisomal straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase. This enzyme is found in sac-like cell structures (organelles) called peroxisomes, which contain a variety of enzymes that break down many different substances.\n\n* **Normal Function:**\n  The peroxisomal straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase enzyme plays a role in the breakdown of certain fat molecules called very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). Specifically, it is involved in the first step of a process called the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. This process shortens the VLCFA molecules by two carbon atoms at a time until the VLCFAs are converted to a molecule called acetyl-CoA, which is transported out of the peroxisomes for reuse by the cell.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nPeroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency is a condition that affects the breakdown of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in the body. More than 20 ACOX1 gene mutations have been identified in people with this condition.\n\n* **Causes:**\n  These mutations prevent the peroxisomal straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase enzyme from breaking down VLCFAs efficiently. As a result, these fatty acids accumulate in the body.\n* **Effects:**\n  It is unclear exactly how VLCFA accumulation leads to the specific features of peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency. However, researchers suggest that the abnormal fatty acid accumulation triggers inflammation in the nervous system that leads to the breakdown of myelin, which is the covering that protects nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses.\n* **Consequences:**\n  Destruction of myelin leads to a loss of myelin-containing tissue (white matter) in the brain and spinal cord; loss of white matter is described as leukodystrophy. Leukodystrophy is likely involved in the development of the neurological abnormalities that occur in peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* ACOX1\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* More information about this health condition can be found on MedlinePlus Genetics.\n\n---\n\n**ACOX1 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**What is ACOX1?**\n\nThe ACOX1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called acyl-CoA oxidase 1, which is involved in the breakdown of certain fatty acids within peroxisomes.

Like TRAP5b in bone cells, the TRAP5a enzyme inactivates osteopontin in macrophages and dendritic cells when it is no longer needed.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Spondyloenchondrodysplasia with Immune Dysregulation (SPENCDI)**\n    *   At least 10 mutations in the ACP5 gene have been found to cause SPENCDI.\n    *   This condition is characterized by abnormalities in bone growth and immune system function.\n    *   The ACP5 gene mutations that cause SPENCDI typically change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the TRAP enzyme or result in the production of an abnormally short enzyme.\n    *   These mutations affect both TRAP isoforms and impair or eliminate TRAP's ability to inactivate osteopontin.\n    *   As a result, osteopontin is abnormally active, prolonging bone breakdown by osteoclasts and triggering abnormal inflammation and immune responses by immune cells.\n    *   In people with SPENCDI, increased bone breakdown contributes to the skeletal abnormalities, including irregularly shaped bones and short stature.\n    *   An overactive immune system leads to increased susceptibility to autoimmune disorders, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs.\n    *   Immune system abnormalities also impair the body's normal response to harmful invaders, resulting in frequent infections.\n\n---\n\n**ACP5 Gene**\n\n**What is the ACP5 Gene?**\n\nThe ACP5 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP).

The ACSF3 enzyme performs a chemical reaction that converts malonic acid to malonyl-CoA, which is the first step of fatty acid synthesis. Based on this activity, the enzyme is classified as a malonyl-CoA synthetase. The ACSF3 enzyme also converts methylmalonic acid to methylmalonyl-CoA, making it a methylmalonyl-CoA synthetase as well.\n\nFatty acid synthesis occurs through two pathways, one of which takes place in cellular structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use, and fatty acid synthesis in these structures is thought to be important for their proper functioning. The ACSF3 enzyme is found only in mitochondria and is involved in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nCombined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria\n* About a dozen mutations in the **ACSF3 gene** have been found in people with combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA), a condition characterized by elevated levels of chemicals known as malonic acid and methylmalonic acid in the body.

Actin proteins are important for cell movement and the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction). These proteins also help maintain the cytoskeleton, which is the structural framework that determines cell shape and organizes cell contents.\n\nSkeletal α-actin plays an important role in skeletal muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. Within skeletal muscle cells, skeletal α-actin is an essential component of structures called sarcomeres. Sarcomeres are composed of thin filaments made up of actin and thick filaments made up of another protein called myosin.

Actin proteins are important for cell movement and the tensing (contraction) of muscles.\n\nSmooth muscle α-2 actin is found in smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscles line the internal organs, including the blood vessels, stomach, and intestines. Within smooth muscle cells, smooth muscle α-2 actin forms the core of structures called sarcomeres, which are necessary for muscles to contract. Smooth muscles contract and relax as part of their normal function without being consciously controlled.\n\nLayers of smooth muscle cells are found in the walls of the arteries, which are blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Smooth muscle α-2 actin contributes to the ability of these muscles to contract, which allows the arteries to maintain their shape instead of stretching out as blood is pumped through them.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection\n  More than 30 ACTA2 gene mutations have been identified in people with familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (familial TAAD). This disorder involves problems with the aorta, which is the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body. The aorta can weaken and stretch, causing a bulge in the blood vessel wall (an aneurysm). Stretching of the aorta may also lead to a sudden tearing of the layers in the aorta wall (aortic dissection). Aortic aneurysm and dissection can cause life-threatening internal bleeding.\n\nACTA2 gene mutations that are associated with familial TAAD change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the smooth muscle α-2 actin protein. These changes likely affect the way the protein functions in smooth muscle contraction, interfering with the sarcomeres' ability to prevent arteries from stretching. The aorta, where the force of pumping blood coming directly from the heart is most intense, is particularly vulnerable to this stretching, resulting in the aortic aneurysms and dissections associated with familial TAAD.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* \n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* \n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n*\n\n---\n\n**ACTA2 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nAt least one mutation in the ACTA2 gene causes multisystemic smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome.

  "d850090756efd33d77f84539e610bd5a": "**ACTG2 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe ACTG2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called gamma (γ)-2 actin, which is part of the actin protein family. Actin proteins are organized into filaments, which are important for the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction) and cell movement. These filaments also help maintain the cytoskeleton, which is the structural framework that determines cell shape and organizes cell contents.\n\nThe γ-2 actin protein is found in smooth muscle cells of the urinary and intestinal tracts. Smooth muscles line the internal organs; they contract and relax without being consciously controlled. The γ-2 actin protein is necessary for contraction of the smooth muscles in the bladder and intestines. These contractions empty urine from the bladder and move food through the intestines as part of the digestive process.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nSeveral inherited mutations in the ACTG2 gene have been identified in people with intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a condition that impairs the smooth muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract (peristalsis). This condition mimics a physical blockage of the intestines without an actual obstruction. Problems with emptying the bladder can also occur in people with this disorder.\n\n*   **Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction**: The ACTG2 gene mutations that cause intestinal pseudo-obstruction are thought to hinder the formation of actin filaments in the cytoskeleton and reduce the ability of smooth muscles in the intestines and bladder to contract. As a result, peristalsis in the intestines is impaired and the bladder is less able to contract and expel urine, leading to the signs and symptoms of this condition.\n\n*   **Megacystis-Microcolon-Intestinal Hypoperistalsis Syndrome (MMIHS)**: At least 22 ACTG2 gene mutations have been found to cause megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS), which is characterized by impairment of peristalsis and emptying the bladder. The ACTG2 gene mutations that cause MMIHS are not inherited; rather they occur as a random (de novo) event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development. The alterations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the γ-2 actin protein. These changes hinder the formation of actin filaments and reduce the ability of smooth muscles in the bladder and intestines to contract. As a result, the bladder cannot empty normally, leading to an enlarged bladder (megacystis) and painful abdominal swelling (distention). In addition, partially digested food can build up in the intestines, which also contributes to distention. Poor digestion may lead to malnutrition in people with MMIHS.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n*   ACTG2 gene\n*   actin gamma 2, smooth muscle\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   More About Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction\n*   More About Megacystis-Microcolon-Intestinal Hypoperistalsis Syndrome (MMIHS)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n(No references provided)\n\n---\n\n**ACTG2 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\n*   ACTG2 gene mutations cause a spectrum of disorders (sometimes referred to as ACTG2-related disorders), with megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) at the severe end.\n*   Most of these mutations change single amino acids in the γ-2 actin protein.\n*   In less severely affected individuals, the mutations are usually inherited.\n*   These mutations often cause intestinal pseudo-obstruction and may also result in episodic smooth muscle problems that come and go throughout life.\n*   Intestinal malrotation can occur in people with ACTG2 gene mutations, which is a condition where the intestines do not fold properly and twist abnormally, impeding food movement.\n*   Effects on the urinary tract include recurrent urinary tract infections and impaired bladder function.\n\n**Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction**\n\n*   Several inherited mutations in the ACTG2 gene have been identified in people with intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a condition that impairs smooth muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract (peristalsis).\n*   This condition mimics a physical blockage of the intestines without an actual obstruction.\n*   Problems with emptying the bladder can also occur in people with this disorder.\n\n**Megacystis-Microcolon-Intestinal Hypoperistalsis Syndrome (MMIHS)**\n\n*   At least 22 ACTG2 gene mutations have been found to cause megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS), which is characterized by impairment of peristalsis and emptying the bladder.\n*   The ACTG2 gene mutations that cause MMIHS are not inherited; rather they occur as a random (de novo) event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development.\n*   These changes hinder the formation of actin filaments and reduce the ability of smooth muscles in the bladder and intestines to contract, leading to an enlarged bladder (megacystis), painful abdominal swelling (distention), and poor digestion that may result in malnutrition.\n\n---\n\n**ACTG2 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\nThe ACTG2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called gamma-2 actin, which is found in smooth muscle cells that line the intestines and urinary tract. Individuals with inherited ACTG2 gene mutations can have one or more of these intestinal or urinary tract abnormalities; they are usually milder than MMIHS, or they begin later in life.\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nACTG2 gene mutations cause a spectrum of disorders (sometimes referred to as ACTG2-related disorders), with MMIHS (described above) at the severe end. As in MMIHS, most of these mutations change single amino acids in the γ-2 actin protein. However, in less severely affected individuals, the mutations are usually inherited.\n\nThese mutations often cause intestinal pseudo-obstruction (described above). In some affected individuals, the smooth muscle problems are episodic and come and go throughout life. Intestinal malrotation can also occur in people with ACTG2 gene mutations. This condition occurs when the intestines do not fold properly; instead, they twist abnormally, which can impede the movement of food.\n\nEffects on the urinary tract include recurrent urinary tract infections and impaired bladder function. Individuals with inherited ACTG2 gene mutations can have one or more of these intestinal or urinary tract abnormalities; they are usually milder than MMIHS, or they begin later in life.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n*   ACT\n*   ACTA3\n*   ACTE\n*   actin, gamma-enteric smooth muscle isoform 1 precursor\n*   actin, gamma-enteric smooth muscle isoform 2 precursor\n*   actin-like protein\n*   ACTL3\n*   ACTSG\n*   alpha-actin-3\n*   VSCM\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n    *   Tests of ACTG2\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n    *   PubMed\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n    *   ACTIN, GAMMA-2, SMOOTH MUSCLE, ENTERIC; ACTG2\n*   Gene and Variant Databases:\n    *   NCBI Gene\n    *   ClinVar\n\n**References**\n\n1.

BMP receptors span the cell membrane, so that one end of the protein remains inside the cell and the other end projects from the outer surface of the cell. This arrangement allows receptors to receive signals from outside the cell and transmit them inside to affect cell development and function.\n\nThe ACVR1 protein is found in many tissues of the body including skeletal muscle and cartilage. It helps to control the growth and development of the bones and muscles, including the gradual replacement of cartilage by bone (ossification). This process occurs in normal skeletal maturation from birth to young adulthood.\n\nThe ACVR1 protein is normally turned on (activated) at appropriate times by molecules called ligands. Activation may occur when these ligands, such as BMPs or a protein called activin A, attach (bind) to the receptor or to other proteins with which it forms a complex. Another protein called FKBP12 can turn off (inhibit) ACVR1 by binding to the receptor and preventing inappropriate (leaky) activation in the absence of ligands.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva\n  * Variants (also known as mutations) in the ACVR1 gene cause fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, a disorder in which muscles and connective tissue such as tendons and ligaments are gradually replaced by bone (ossified). The formation of bone tissue outside the skeleton freezes joints and limits movement in affected individuals.\n  * The most common variant, which occurs in all individuals with the classic features of the condition, substitutes the protein building block (amino acid) histidine for the amino acid arginine at position 206 of the ACVR1 protein (written as Arg206His or R206H).\n  * Other variants in the ACVR1 gene cause rarer forms of the condition that can be more severe and often involve skeletal abnormalities, such as multiple abnormally formed fingers and toes.\n  * The variants that cause fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva occur as a random (de novo) event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) in an affected person's parent or in early embryonic development. The genetic change is found in all of the affected person's cells.\n  * Studies show that the R206H variant changes the shape of the ACVR1 protein.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* Not specified\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Not specified\n\n**References**\n\n* Not specified\n\n---\n\n**ACVR1 Gene**\n\n**Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva**\n\nVariants (also known as mutations) in the ACVR1 gene cause fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, a disorder in which muscles and connective tissue such as tendons and ligaments are gradually replaced by bone (ossified). The formation of bone tissue outside the skeleton freezes joints and limits movement in affected individuals. The most common variant, which occurs in all individuals with the classic features of the condition, substitutes the protein building block (amino acid) histidine for the amino acid arginine at position 206 of the ACVR1 protein (written as Arg206His or R206H).

The genetic change is found in all of the affected person's cells.\n\n* Studies show that the R206H variant changes the shape of the ACVR1 protein.\n* This shape change disrupts the binding of the inhibitor protein FKBP12.\n* As a result, the receptor is constantly turned on (constitutively activated), even in the absence of ligands.\n* Other ACVR1 gene variants result in a receptor protein that is turned on by ligands more easily than the normal version of the protein.\n* Too much receptor activity causes overgrowth of bone and cartilage, resulting in the signs and symptoms of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.\n* Although the same ACVR1 gene variants that cause fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva are associated with a rare brain cancer (described below), people with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva do not have an increased risk of developing cancer.\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nVariants in the ACVR1 gene contribute to the development of a rare brain cancer in children called diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG).\n\n* Most people with DIPG have a particular genetic change in another gene, but a second variant in a different gene (such as ACVR1) is required for a tumor to develop.\n* The same ACVR1 gene variants that cause fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva are associated with DIPG.\n* In DIPG, the variant occurs during a person’s lifetime and is found only in cells that become cancerous (a somatic variant).\n* Abnormal ACVR1 receptor activity can make cells grow and divide uncontrollably, leading to cancer.\n\n---\n\n**ACVR1 Gene**\n\nThe ACVR1 gene is associated with the development of a rare brain cancer in children called diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). Most people with DIPG have a particular genetic change in another gene, but a second variant in a different gene (such as ACVR1) is required for a tumor to develop. ACVR1 variants are found in around 25 percent of children with DIPG.\n\n**Relationship to Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva**\n\nMost of the ACVR1 gene variants involved in DIPG are the same as those that cause fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). However, in DIPG, the variant occurs during a person's lifetime and is found only in cells that become cancerous. This type of genetic change is called a somatic variant.\n\n**How ACVR1 Variants Contribute to Cancer**\n\nAs in FOP, the ACVR1 variant increases the activity of the ACVR1 receptor. In combination with other cellular changes, abnormal ACVR1 receptor activity can make cells grow and divide uncontrollably, leading to cancer.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* Activin A receptor type I\n* Activin A receptor, type I\n* Activin A receptor, type II-like kinase 2\n* Activin A type I receptor\n* Activin A type I receptor precursor\n* ActR-IA protein, human\n* ACTRI\n* ACVR1_HUMAN\n* ACVR1A\n* ACVRLK2\n* ALK2\n* Hydroxyalkyl-protein kinase\n* SKR1\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* **Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry**: Tests of ACVR1\n* **Scientific Articles on PubMed**: PubMed\n* **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**: ACTIVIN A RECEPTOR, TYPE I; ACVR1\n* **Gene and Variant Databases**: NCBI Gene, ClinVar\n\n**References**\n\n1.

This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of proteins when they are no longer needed. Many proteins in the body have a chemical group called an acetyl group attached to one end. This modification, called N-acetylation, helps protect and stabilize the protein. Aminoacylase 1 performs the final step in the breakdown of these proteins by removing the acetyl group from certain protein building blocks (amino acids). The amino acids can then be recycled and used to build other proteins.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nAminoacylase 1 deficiency is a condition characterized by delayed development of mental and motor skills and other neurological problems. Some people with this condition have no signs or symptoms. Most associated ACY1 gene mutations change single amino acids in the aminoacylase 1 enzyme, leading to production of an enzyme with little or no function.\n\nWithout the enzyme's function, acetyl groups are not efficiently removed from a subset of amino acids (including methionine, glutamic acid, alanine, serine, glycine, leucine, valine, threonine, and isoleucine) during the breakdown of proteins.

This enzyme is produced in all cells, but the highest levels of adenosine deaminase are found in immune system cells called lymphocytes. These cells defend the body against foreign invaders, such as viruses or bacteria. Lymphocytes are produced in specialized lymphoid tissues throughout the body, including in a gland located behind the breastbone called the thymus and in the lymph nodes.\n\nThe function of the adenosine deaminase enzyme is to get rid of a molecule called deoxyadenosine, which is generated when DNA is broken down. A buildup of deoxyadenosine in cells can lead to early cell death. Adenosine deaminase converts deoxyadenosine to another molecule called deoxyinosine, which is not harmful.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency**\n  Many variants (also called mutations) in the ADA gene have been found to cause adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. This condition impairs the immune system and causes health problems that typically begin early in life. Most of the ADA gene variants that cause ADA deficiency change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the adenosine deaminase enzyme. Other variants cause the enzyme to be unstable or prevent it from being produced at all. These variants reduce the levels of functional adenosine deaminase enzyme in cells and prevent the normal breakdown of deoxyadenosine.\n\n  The severity of the condition generally depends on how much functional enzyme is available. Individuals with no enzyme activity have ADA deficiency with severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID). Those with greatly reduced enzyme activity have a form of the condition known as delayed or late-onset combined immunodeficiency (ADA-CID), and those with somewhat reduced enzyme activity have partial ADA deficiency.\n\n  A buildup of deoxyadenosine can lead to the early death of lymphocytes, which are very sensitive to changes in the level of adenosine deaminase.

This enzyme breaks down molecules called adenosine and 2'-deoxyadenosine. Because this enzyme functions in the spaces between cells, it is described as extracellular. Another form of the enzyme, adenosine deaminase 1, breaks down the same molecules inside cells. This other version of the enzyme is produced from the ADA gene.\n\nResearchers are still working to determine the functions of adenosine deaminase 2. Studies suggest that it acts as a growth factor, which means that it stimulates cell growth and division. In particular, the enzyme appears to be involved in the growth and development of certain immune system cells, including macrophages, which are a type of white blood cell that plays a critical role in inflammation. Inflammation is a normal immune system response to injury and foreign invaders (such as bacteria). Some macrophages are pro-inflammatory, meaning they promote inflammation, while others are anti-inflammatory, meaning they reduce inflammation.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Adenosine deaminase 2 deficiency\n  More than 60 mutations in the ADA2 gene have been found to cause adenosine deaminase 2 deficiency, a disorder characterized by abnormal inflammation of various organs and tissues, particularly the blood vessels (vasculitis).

Each of these mutations prevents the cell from producing any functional ADAMTS10 enzyme.\n* Researchers speculate that a loss of this enzyme disrupts skeletal development, leading to short stature and unusually short fingers and toes (brachydactyly).\n* A shortage of the ADAMTS10 enzyme also interferes with the development and function of the lens of the eye, causing eye abnormalities and impaired vision.\n* Additionally, a lack of  this enzyme may disrupt the normal development of the heart, resulting in the heart defects occasionally seen in people with Weill-Marchesani syndrome.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 10\n* A disintegrin-like and metalloprotease (reprolysin type) with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 10\n* A disintegrin-like and metalloprotease domain with thrombospondin type I repeats 10\n* ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 10\n* ADAM-TS10\n* ADAMTS-10\n* ATS10_HUMAN\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n\t+ Tests of **ADAMTS10**\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n\t+ PubMed\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ A DISINTEGRIN-LIKE AND METALLOPROTEINASE WITH THROMBOSPONDIN TYPE 1 MOTIF, 10; ADAMTS10\n\n---\n\n**ADAMTS10 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Gene and Variant Databases**\n\n*   **NCBI Gene**: \n*   **ClinVar**: \n\n**Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry**\n\n*   **Tests of ADAMTS10**\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   **PubMed**: \n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   **A DISINTEGRIN-LIKE AND METALLOPROTEINASE WITH THROMBOSPONDIN TYPE 1 MOTIF, 10; ADAMTS10**\n\n**References**\n\n*   Dagoneau N, Benoist-Lasselin C, Huber C, Faivre L, Megarbane A, Alswaid A, Dollfus H, Alembik Y, Munnich A, Legeai-Mallet L, Cormier-Daire V.

The ADAMTS13 enzyme processes a large protein called von Willebrand factor. This protein is involved in the first step of blood clotting at the site of injury, which is to help cells called platelets stick together and attach to the walls of blood vessels, forming temporary clots.\n\nThe ADAMTS13 enzyme cuts von Willebrand factor into smaller pieces to regulate its interaction with platelets. By processing von Willebrand factor in this way, the enzyme prevents it from triggering the formation of blood clots in normal circulation.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)**\n  More than 150 mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene have been reported in people with the familial form of TTP. This condition causes blood clots (thrombi) to form in small blood vessels throughout the body, leading to serious medical problems if they block vessels and restrict blood flow to organs such as the brain, kidneys, and heart.\n\n  Complications resulting from these clots can include neurological problems (such as personality changes, headaches, confusion, and slurred speech), fever, abnormal kidney function, abdominal pain, and heart problems. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ADAMTS13 enzyme, while others lead to the production of an abnormally small version of the enzyme that cannot function properly.\n\n  These mutations severely reduce the activity of the ADAMTS13 enzyme, causing von Willebrand factor to be processed abnormally in the bloodstream. If the factor is not cut into smaller fragments by the ADAMTS13 enzyme, it promotes the formation of abnormal clots throughout the body. The uncut version of von Willebrand factor is hyperactive and may induce platelets to stick together, even in the absence of injury, leading to the signs and symptoms of TTP.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 13\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* More information about this gene can be found on MedlinePlus Genetics.\n* References:\n  * (Add references here)\n\n---\n\n**ADAMTS13 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**What is the ADAMTS13 gene?**\n\nThe ADAMTS13 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called ADAMTS13, which plays a critical role in preventing abnormal blood clots from forming throughout the body.

Procollagens are the precursors of collagens, which are complex molecules found in the spaces between cells that add strength, support, and stretchiness (elasticity) to many body tissues. The ADAMTS2 enzyme cuts a short chain of protein building blocks (amino acids) off one end of procollagens. This clipping step is necessary for the resulting collagen molecules to assemble into strong, slender fibrils.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nSeveral mutations in the ADAMTS2 gene have been identified in people with a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome called the dermatosparaxis type. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect the connective tissues supporting the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. The dermatosparaxis type is characterized by soft, fragile skin that sags and wrinkles; easy bruising; and distinctive facial features.\n\nMutations in the ADAMTS2 gene greatly reduce the production or activity of the ADAMTS2 enzyme. Without enough of this enzyme, procollagens cannot be processed correctly. As a result, collagen fibrils are not assembled properly. The resulting fibrils are disorganized, which weakens connective tissues and leads to the signs and symptoms of the disorder.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 2\n* A disintegrin-like and metalloprotease (reprolysin type) with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 2\n* ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 2\n* ADAM-TS2\n* ATS2_HUMAN\n* hPCPNI\n* NPI\n* PCINP\n* PCPNI\n* pNPI\n* Procollagen I N-proteinase\n* Procollagen I/II amino-propeptide processing enzyme\n* Procollagen N-endopeptidase\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n  * Tests of ADAMTS2\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n  * PubMed\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n  * A DISINTEGRIN-LIKE AND METALLOPROTEINASE WITH THROMBOSPONDIN TYPE 1 MOTIF, 2; ADAMTS2\n\n---\n\n**ADAMTS2 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Gene and Variant Databases**\n\n*   **NCBI Gene**\n*   **ClinVar**\n\n**Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry**\n\n*   **Tests of ADAMTS2**\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   **PubMed**\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   **A DISINTEGRIN-LIKE AND METALLOPROTEINASE WITH THROMBOSPONDIN TYPE 1 MOTIF, 2; ADAMTS2**\n\n**References**\n\n*   Colige A, Nuytinck L, Hausser I, van Essen AJ, Thiry M, Herens C, Ades LC, Malfait F, Paepe AD, Franck P, Wolff G, Oosterwijk JC, Smitt JH, Lapiere CM, Nusgens BV.

  "13973329f1c2597d2ad2302b4a8dd4b7": "**ADAMTSL4 Gene**\n\nThe **ADAMTSL4 gene** provides instructions for making a protein that is found throughout the body. The ADAMTSL4 protein is released from cells into the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. In this matrix, the ADAMTSL4 protein attaches (binds) to another protein called fibrillin-1. Fibrillin-1 proteins bind to each other and other proteins to form threadlike filaments called microfibrils. It is likely that the binding of ADAMTSL4 to fibrillin-1 promotes microfibril assembly. Microfibrils provide support to many tissues, including the lenses of the eyes, which are held in their central position by these filaments.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Isolated Ectopia Lentis**\n  At least 15 mutations in the ADAMTSL4 gene have been found to cause isolated ectopia lentis. In this condition, the lens in one or both eyes is off-center (displaced), which leads to vision problems. An ADAMTSL4 gene mutation that is frequently found in affected individuals of European ancestry deletes 20 DNA building blocks (nucleotides) from the gene (written as 767_787del20). This mutation leads to the production of a protein that is abnormally short and nonfunctional. A lack of functional ADAMTSL4 protein likely diminishes the ability of fibrillin-1 to effectively form microfibrils. As a result, there is a reduction in filaments to anchor the lens in its central position at the front of the eye, leading to its displacement and the vision problems characteristic of isolated ectopia lentis. While the ADAMTSL4 protein is found throughout the body, it is thought that other proteins can compensate for its function in tissues other than the eyes, which likely explains why only the eyes are affected in this condition.\n\n* **Other Disorders**\n  Some ADAMTSL4 gene mutations cause an eye condition called ectopia lentis et pupillae. In this condition, both the lenses and the pupils are off-center; they are usually displaced in opposite directions. People with ectopia lentis et pupillae have eye and vision problems similar to those with isolated ectopia lentis (described above), including nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), or an irregular curvature of the front of the eye (astigmatism). They may also develop clouding of the lenses (cataracts) or increased pressure in the eyes (glaucoma) at an early age. Similar to isolated ectopia lentis, the ADAMTSL4 gene mutations that cause ectopia lentis et pupillae lead to decreased production of microfibrils or the formation of impaired microfibrils, which prevents the proper anchoring of certain structures in the eyes.

This protein is involved in making changes to (editing) RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. Specifically, it attaches (binds) to RNA and changes an RNA building block (nucleotide) called adenosine to another nucleotide called inosine.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe ADAR1 protein is involved in the control of the innate immune response, which is the immune system's early response to foreign invaders (pathogens). The immune system sometimes fails to recognize the body’s own RNA and may act as though it belongs to a pathogen that should be attacked. By changing adenosine to inosine, ADAR1 may prevent the immune system from targeting the body's own tissues.\n\nThe ADAR1 protein is also thought to inhibit the replication and spread of certain viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C, by modifying their RNA. In addition, the ADAR1 protein controls the function of certain chemical messengers called neurotransmitters at particular sites in the body by modifying the RNA blueprint for the receptor proteins that interact with the neurotransmitters. Studies suggest that the ADAR1 protein may have other functions that are not well understood.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Aicardi-Goutières syndrome\n  Variants (also called mutations) in the ADAR gene have been identified in people with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a disorder that typically involves severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), skin lesions, immune system abnormalities, and other health problems. Some of these variants lead to the production of an ADAR1 protein that is less able to bind to RNA; others impair the protein's RNA editing function.

This enzyme helps convert a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to another molecule called cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). ATP is a molecule that supplies energy for cells' activities, including muscle contraction, and cAMP is involved in signaling for many cellular functions.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **ADCY5-related dyskinesia**\n  At least six ADCY5 gene mutations have been identified in people with ADCY5-related dyskinesia, a disorder that causes abnormal involuntary movements. These mutations are thought to enhance adenylate cyclase 5 enzyme activity and lead to higher levels of cAMP within cells, so they are described as \"gain-of-function\" mutations. Other ADCY5 gene mutations prevent production of adenylate cyclase 5. It is unclear how either type of mutation leads to the abnormal movements that occur in this disorder.\n* **Other disorders**\n  Certain normal variations (polymorphisms) in the ADCY5 gene have been associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, which is the most common form of diabetes and results in impaired control of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. cAMP normally increases in response to increases in blood glucose and is involved in signaling that stimulates the production of insulin. Researchers suggest that the polymorphisms associated with increased type 2 diabetes risk may decrease the ability of the adenylate cyclase 5 enzyme to produce cAMP, resulting in the abnormal response to glucose that occurs in type 2 diabetes.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* AC5\n* Adenylate cyclase type 5\n* Adenylate cyclase type 5 isoform 1\n* Adenylate cyclase type 5 isoform 2\n* Adenylate cyclase type V\n* Adenylyl cyclase 5\n* ATP pyrophosphate-lyase 5\n* FDFM\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n  * Tests of ADCY5\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n  * PubMed\n\n---\n\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n  \n    \n      ADENYLATE CYCLASE 5; ADCY5\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  Gene and Variant Databases\n  \n    \n      NCBI Gene \n    \n      ClinVar\nTests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry\n  \n    \n      Tests of ADCY5\nScientific Articles on PubMed\n  \n    \n      PubMed\nCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n  \n    \n      ADENYLATE CYCLASE 5; ADCY5\nGene and Variant Databases\n  \n    \n      NCBI Gene \n    \n      ClinVar\nReferences\n\t\nExpand Section\nReferences\n\t\nExpand Section\nReferences\nExpand Section\nCarapito R, Paul N, Untrau M, Le Gentil M, Ott L, Alsaleh G, Jochem P,\nRadosavljevic M, Le Caignec C, David A, Damier P, Isidor B, Bahram S.

  "2c11926cf56ebbcc958dadc5341194d2": "**ADCY5-related Dyskinesia**\n\n**Description**\n\\n\\n\nADCY5-related dyskinesia is a movement disorder; the term \"dyskinesia\" refers to abnormal involuntary movements. The abnormal movements that occur in ADCY5-related dyskinesia typically appear as sudden (paroxysmal) jerks, twitches, tremors, muscle tensing (dystonia), or writhing (choreiform) movements, and can affect the limbs, neck, and face.\n\nThe abnormal movements associated with ADCY5-related dyskinesia usually begin between infancy and late adolescence. They can occur continually during waking hours, and frequently also disturb sleep. The involuntary movements often occur when changing position, such as from sitting to standing, or when deliberately making other movements.\n\nSeverely affected infants may experience weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and delay in development of motor skills such as crawling and walking; later, these individuals may have difficulties with activities of daily living and may eventually require a wheelchair. In more mildly affected individuals, the condition has little impact on walking and other motor skills, although the abnormal movements can lead to clumsiness or difficulty with social acceptance in school or other situations.\n\nIn some people with ADCY5-related dyskinesia, the disorder is generally stable throughout their lifetime. In others, it slowly gets worse (progresses) in both frequency and severity before stabilizing or even improving in middle age. Anxiety, fatigue, and other stress can temporarily increase the severity of the signs and symptoms of ADCY5-related dyskinesia, while some affected individuals may experience remission periods of days or weeks without abnormal movements. Life expectancy is not usually affected by ADCY5-related dyskinesia, and most people with this condition have normal intelligence.\n\n**Frequency**\n\n* The abnormal movements associated with ADCY5-related dyskinesia can occur continually during waking hours.\n* They frequently also disturb sleep.\n* The involuntary movements often occur when changing position or making other deliberate movements.\n\n**Causes**\n\\n\\n\nThe exact cause of ADCY5-related dyskinesia is not fully understood. However, it is known to be caused by mutations in the ADCY5 gene.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\\n\\n\nADCY5-related dyskinesia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* ADCY5-related movement disorder\n* Dyskinesia due to ADCY5 mutation\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\\n\\n\nFor more information about ADCY5-related dyskinesia, you can contact:\n * [National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/)\n\n**References**\n\n* [MedlinePlus Genetics](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/adcy5-related-dyskinesia/)\n\n---\n\n**ADCY5-related Dyskinesia**\n\n**What is ADCY5-related Dyskinesia?**\n\nADCY5-related dyskinesia is a movement disorder characterized by abnormal involuntary movements. The condition typically begins between infancy and late adolescence, affecting the limbs, neck, and face.\n\n**Causes of ADCY5-related Dyskinesia**\n\nThe condition is caused by mutations in the ADCY5 gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called adenylate cyclase 5. This enzyme helps convert a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to another molecule called cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Some ADCY5 gene mutations that cause ADCY5-related dyskinesia are thought to increase adenylate cyclase 5 enzyme activity and the level of cAMP within cells. Others prevent production of adenylate cyclase 5.\n\n**Symptoms of ADCY5-related Dyskinesia**\n\nThe symptoms of ADCY5-related dyskinesia can vary in severity and frequency, but may include:\n\n* Sudden (paroxysmal) jerks\n* Twitches\n* Tremors\n* Muscle tensing (dystonia)\n* Writhing (choreiform) movements\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Familial dyskinesia with facial myokymia (FDFM)\n\n**Frequency of ADCY5-related Dyskinesia**\n\nAt least 400 people have been diagnosed with ADCY5-related dyskinesia, but its prevalence is unknown. The disorder is thought to be underdiagnosed because its features can resemble those of other conditions such as cerebral palsy or epilepsy.\n\n**Life Expectancy and Intelligence**\n\nLife expectancy is not usually affected by ADCY5-related dyskinesia, and most people with this condition have normal intelligence.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Genetic Testing Registry: Dyskinesia with orofacial involvement, autosomal dominant\n* Familial dyskinesia and facial myokymia (Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center)\n\n---\n\n**ADCY5-related Dyskinesia**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Definition:** \nDyskinesia with orofacial involvement, autosomal dominant\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**\n\n* Familial dyskinesia and facial myokymia\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Patient Support and Advocacy Resources**\n\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Clinical Trials**\n\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n* DYSKINESIA WITH OROFACIAL INVOLVEMENT, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT; DSKOD\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n1.

Mast cells, which are found in many body tissues including the skin, are important for the normal protective functions of the immune system. They also play a role in allergic reactions, which occur when the immune system overreacts to stimuli that are not harmful. The specific role of the ADGRE2 protein in mast cells is not well understood.\n\nThe ADGRE2 protein consists of two parts (subunits) that interact with each other: an alpha subunit that lies on the outside surface of the cell and a beta subunit that crosses the cell membrane and extends into the cell.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Vibratory Urticaria**\n  At least one mutation in the ADGRE2 gene has been identified in people with vibratory urticaria, a condition in which vibration, repetitive stretching, or friction on the skin results in allergy symptoms such as hives (urticaria), swelling (angioedema), redness (erythema), and itching (pruritus) in the affected area. The reaction can be brought on by towel drying, hand clapping, running, a bumpy ride in a vehicle, or other repetitive stimulation.\n  The ADGRE2 gene mutation that causes vibratory urticaria, written as Cys492Tyr or C492Y, replaces the protein building block (amino acid) cysteine with the amino acid tyrosine at position 492 of the protein sequence. The substitution alters the protein structure and leads to a less stable interaction between the two subunits.

  "1e387e54ee5dac70116df6cb4e011146": "**ADGRG1 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe ADGRG1 gene, formerly known as GPR56, provides instructions for making a protein that is critical for normal brain development. Before birth, the ADGRG1 protein appears to be essential for the normal growth and movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons) in a part of the brain called the cerebral cortex. This outer layer of the brain carries out many important functions, such as sensation, voluntary muscle movement, thought, planning, and memory.\n\nAlthough the ADGRG1 protein has been studied most extensively in the brain, it is active in many of the body's tissues. This protein interacts with other proteins on the cell surface to trigger a series of chemical signals within the cell. Studies suggest that ADGRG1 signaling may play an important role in attaching cells to one another (cell adhesion).\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Polymicrogyria**\n  At least eleven mutations in the ADGRG1 gene have been identified in people with a severe form of polymicrogyria called bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP). This disorder causes intellectual disability, delayed development, problems with speech and movement, and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). Most of the identified mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the ADGRG1 protein. These mutations interfere with the normal processing of the protein. The abnormal protein becomes trapped within the cell, where it is unable to reach the cell surface to carry out its normal signaling functions.\n\nA loss of ADGRG1 protein function likely disrupts the normal migration of neurons in the developing brain. As a result, certain regions of the cerebral cortex—areas known as the frontal and parietal lobes—develop too many folds (called gyri), and the folds are unusually small. These brain abnormalities cause intellectual disability and the other neurological problems associated with bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* **GPR56**\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* More information about this health condition can be found in the section above.\n\n**References**\n\n* The references for this article are not provided.\n\n---\n\n**ADGRG1 Gene**\n\n**What is the ADGRG1 gene?**\n\nThe ADGRG1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called adhesion G-protein coupled receptor G1, which plays a critical role in the development of the brain.\n\n**Health Conditions Associated with the ADGRG1 Gene**\n\nMutations in the ADGRG1 gene have been identified in people with a severe form of polymicrogyria called bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP).

It's a common developmental disorder that begins in childhood and often lasts into adulthood.\n\n**Types of ADHD**\n\nThere are three types of ADHD:\n\n* **Mostly Inattentive ADHD**: People with this type have trouble paying attention and are easily distracted. They may have trouble following instructions or conversations.\n* **Mostly Hyperactive-Impulsive ADHD**: People with this type have symptoms of both hyperactivity and impulsivity, including:\n\t+ Hyperactivity: feeling a need to always be moving, having trouble sitting still, and fidgeting\n\t+ Impulsivity: trouble controlling actions and words, acting on sudden ideas or feelings without thinking about the possible results\n* **Combined ADHD**: People with this type have a mix of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. It's the most common type.\n\n**Why is ADHD Screening Important?**\n\nADHD screening is used to check for ADHD in people who have frequent, serious problems with attention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsive behavior. The screening also checks for other mental disorders that often happen with ADHD.\n\n**Symptoms of ADHD**\n\nPeople with symptoms of attention problems may:\n\n* Miss details or make careless mistakes\n* Have trouble staying focused on play activities or work tasks\n* Not seem to listen when spoken to directly\n* Find it hard to follow instructions or finish tasks\n\nPeople with symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity may:\n\n* Fidget and squirm while seated\n* Get up when staying seated is expected\n* Run around or climb when it's not appropriate (children) or feel restless (teens and adults)\n* Have trouble doing quiet activities\n* Be constantly moving or \"on the go\"\n* Talk much more than is normal\n\n**What Happens During an ADHD Screening?**\n\nThe general screening process involves several steps:\n\n1. **Physical Exam**: A primary care provider may do a physical exam to check for certain health conditions that can cause symptoms similar to ADHD.\n2. **Review of Medical History and Family Health History**: The provider will review medical history, family health history, and other records to help determine the cause of ADHD.\n3. **Gathering Information Using Standardized ADHD Symptom Checklists and Questionnaires**: A provider will use one or more tools to gather, organize, and evaluate information during an ADHD screening.\n4. **Screening for Other Mental Health Disorders**: The provider may screen for other mental health disorders that often happen with ADHD.\n\n**Preparing for ADHD Screening**\n\nYou usually don't need any special preparations for ADHD screening. Your provider will let you know what health and school records you may need to gather.\n\n**Risks of ADHD Screening**\n\nThere is no risk to a physical exam, written test, or questionnaire.\n\n**What Do the Results Mean?**\n\nThe provider will write up the results of an ADHD screening in a report that includes a diagnosis. To diagnose ADHD, the screening must find:\n\n* Several symptoms of ADHD that began before age 12\n* Several symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that have lasted for at least 6 months and cause serious problems\n* Symptoms that happen in 2 or more settings (e.g., at home and at work or school)\n* Symptoms that clearly get in the way of functioning well at school, work, and/or in social situations\n\nIf there is a diagnosis of ADHD, the report will include the type of ADHD (inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, or combined) and whether it's mild, moderate, or severe. Any other disorders that may have been found will be included in the report.\n\n---\n\n**ADHD Screening: MedlinePlus Medical Test (Part 2/4)**\n\n**Category:** Health\n\nThere's no cure for ADHD, but treatment may help reduce symptoms. Treatment may include medicine, talk therapy, behavioral therapy, and lifestyle changes. Usually, two or more treatments are combined. Parents of children with ADHD may also receive training to help their children manage ADHD.\n\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\n\nShow references\n\n**What is ADHD Screening?**\n\nADHD screening is also called ADHD testing. It helps find out if a child, teen, or adult has ADHD. ADHD stands for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It used to be called ADD (attention-deficit disorder).\n\nA person who has ADHD has a hard time paying attention and focusing on tasks. ADHD is a common developmental disorder that begins in childhood and often lasts into adulthood. Although it's usually diagnosed in childhood, some people with ADHD don't get diagnosed with ADHD until they are adults.\n\n**Types of ADHD:**\n\n* Mostly Inattentive ADHD: People with this type of ADHD have trouble paying attention and are easily distracted. It's hard for them to organize or finish tasks. They may have trouble following instructions or conversations.\n* Mostly Hyperactive-Impulsive ADHD: People with this type of ADHD have symptoms of both hyperactivity and impulsivity:\n\t+ With hyperactivity, people feel a need to always be moving. They have trouble sitting still and may fidget and/or talk too much.\n\t+ With impulsivity, people have trouble controlling their actions and words. They tend to act on sudden ideas or feelings without thinking about the possible results. They may interrupt others a lot or have trouble waiting their turn.\n* Combined ADHD: People with this type of ADHD have a mix of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. Combined ADHD is the most common type.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nADHD screening is used to check for ADHD in people who have frequent, serious problems with attention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsive behavior. The screening also checks for other mental disorders that often happen with ADHD. Sometimes symptoms of these other disorders are mistaken for ADHD.\n\nADHD screening is used with children as young as age four. If you have a younger child with symptoms that could be ADHD, ask your child's provider which type of testing might be best.\n\n**Why do I need ADHD Screening?**\n\nYour child may need screening if you, a teacher, or another caregiver thinks your child has symptoms of ADHD.\n\nAdults who have had challenges since childhood (before age 12) with focusing, impulsive behavior, restlessness, and/or being organized can ask their providers if they need to be screened for ADHD. The symptoms depend on the type of ADHD a person has.\n\n**Symptoms of ADHD:**\n\n* Attention problems:\n\t+ Miss details or make careless mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or in other activities\n\t+ Have trouble staying focused on play activities or work tasks\n\t+ Not seem to listen when spoken to directly\n\t+ Find it hard to follow instructions or finish tasks, or may start but get easily sidetracked\n\t+ Have trouble being organized, keeping belongings in order, and managing time\n\t+ Avoid doing tasks that require long periods of mental effort\n\t+ Lose important items, such as books, wallets, keys, eyeglasses, and cellphones\n\t+ Forget about doing daily activities\n* Hyperactivity-impulsivity:\n\t+ Fidget and squirm while seated\n\t+ Get up when staying seated is expected, such as at school or work\n\t+ Run around or climb when it's not appropriate (children) or feel restless (teens and adults)\n\t+ Have trouble doing quiet activities\n\t+ Be constantly moving or \"on the go\"\n\t+ Talk much more than is normal\n\t+ Blurt out answers before questions are completed\n\t+ Have trouble waiting for their turn\n\t+ Interrupt others, for example during conversations or games\n\n**What happens during an ADHD Screening?**\n\nThe general screening process is similar for people of all ages. It involves several steps. A primary care provider may do the entire screening or refer the person to a mental health provider. A mental health provider is a health care professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health problems.\n\nDuring an ADHD screening, the provider will:\n\n* Gather information about your symptoms\n* Ask questions about your behavior and history\n* Do tests to help diagnose ADHD\n* Discuss treatment options with you\n\n---\n\n**ADHD Screening**\n\n**What to Expect During an ADHD Screening**\n\nDuring an ADHD screening, a mental health provider will:\n\n* Do a physical exam to check for certain health conditions that can cause symptoms similar to ADHD\n* Review medical history, family health history, and other records\n* Gather information using standardized ADHD symptom checklists, questionnaires, and/or interview questions\n\n**The Screening Process**\n\nThe general screening process is similar for people of all ages. It involves several steps:\n\n* A primary care provider may do the entire screening or refer the person to a mental health provider\n* The provider will gather information from various sources, including:\n  * For children and teens: Teachers, babysitters, coaches, and other family members who spend time with the child\n  * For adults: Family members who know the person from childhood, and spouses, friends, and co-workers\n* The provider may also screen for other mental health disorders\n\n**Preparing for ADHD Screening**\n\nYou usually don't need any special preparations for ADHD screening.

Chromatin is the network of DNA and protein that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. Chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated during development; when DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed. As part of the remodeling process, the ADNP protein attaches to DNA and interacts with groups of proteins called SWI/SNF complexes, which direct changes in the structure of chromatin.\n\nBy regulating gene expression, the ADNP protein is involved in many aspects of development. It is particularly important for regulation of genes involved in normal brain development, and it likely controls the activity of genes that direct the development and function of other body systems.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*ADNP syndrome*\n\nAt least 22 ADNP gene mutations have been found to cause ADNP syndrome. This condition features intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, which is characterized by impaired communication and social interactions. Affected individuals can also have distinctive facial features and a wide variety of other signs and symptoms. Most ADNP gene mutations are thought to lead to the production of an abnormally short  ADNP protein. Although it is unclear how these genetic changes cause ADNP syndrome, researchers speculate that the abnormally short protein can attach to DNA but cannot interact with SWI/SNF complexes. As a result, chromatin remodeling is impaired. Disturbance of this process alters the activity of many genes and disrupts the development or function of several of the body's tissues and organs, including the brain.

This enzyme performs two steps in the process that produces (synthesizes) purine nucleotides. These nucleotides are building blocks of DNA, its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as ATP that serve as energy sources in the cell.\n\nAdenylosuccinate lyase and other enzymes involved in purine synthesis form a group of proteins (a protein complex) called the purinosome. This complex comes together when there is a shortage of purines or when a large amount of purines is needed, such as during cell division. As part of this complex, adenylosuccinate lyase converts a molecule called succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (SAICAR) to aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (AICAR) and converts succinyladenosine monophosphate (SAMP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP).\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency\n  * More than 50 mutations in the ADSL gene have been found to cause this condition.\n  * It causes brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) that leads to delayed development of mental and motor skills (psychomotor delay), autistic behaviors, and seizures.\n  * The altered enzymes have two to 20 percent of normal function and are less able to form stable purinosomes.\n  * A reduction of adenylosuccinate lyase function leads to buildup of SAICAR and SAMP, which can be detected in body fluids to help with diagnosis.\n  * Researchers believe that SAICAr and S-Ado are toxic and likely cause the neurological problems associated with this condition.\n  * The amount of SAICAr relative to S-Ado reflects the severity of adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* (No information available)\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* (No information available)\n\n**References**\n\n* (No information available)\n\n---\n\n**ADSL Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Adenylosuccinate Lyase Deficiency**\n\nAdenylosuccinate lyase deficiency is a condition that causes brain dysfunction, leading to delayed development of mental and motor skills, autistic behaviors, and seizures.

During embryonic development, the SEC is involved in an activity called transcription, which is the first step in the production of proteins from genes. By re-starting the transcription of certain genes after pauses that normally occur during the process, the SEC helps ensure that development proceeds appropriately before birth.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **CHOPS Syndrome**\n  Mutations in the AFF4 gene cause CHOPS syndrome, a disorder involving multiple abnormalities that are present from birth (congenital). The name \"CHOPS\" is an abbreviation for a list of features of the disorder including cognitive impairment, coarse facial features, heart defects, obesity, lung (pulmonary) involvement, short stature, and skeletal abnormalities.\n  The AFF4 gene mutations identified in people with CHOPS syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the AFF4 protein. These mutations are thought to result in an AFF4 protein that is not broken down when it is no longer needed, so more AFF4 protein is available than usual. The excess AFF4 protein interferes with normal pauses in transcription. This dysregulation of transcription leads to problems in the development of multiple organs and tissues, resulting in the signs and symptoms of CHOPS syndrome.\n\n* **Cancers**\n  The AFF4 gene is occasionally involved in chromosomal rearrangements (translocations) that are found in certain blood cancers called infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia and mixed lineage leukemia. The translocations fuse the AFF4 gene with another gene called KMT2A (formerly known as MLL). The fusion gene provides instructions for making an abnormal protein that combines features of the proteins produced from AFF4 and KMT2A.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* \n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* \n\n**References**\n\n* \n\n**Related Topics**\n\n*\n\n---\n\n**AFF4 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\nThe AFF4 gene is involved in chromosomal rearrangements (translocations) that are found in certain blood cancers called infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia and mixed lineage leukemia.\n\n*   **Cancers**\n    *   The translocations fuse the AFF4 gene with another gene called KMT2A (formerly known as MLL).\n    *   The fusion gene provides instructions for making an abnormal protein that combines features of the proteins produced from AFF4 and KMT2A.\n    *   The abnormal protein likely disrupts the transcription elongation function of the SEC, which alters normal gene activity (expression) and results in the uncontrolled growth of cells that occurs in leukemia.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n*   AF4/FMR2 family, member 4\n*   AF5Q31\n*   ALL1-fused gene from chromosome 5q31 protein major\n*   CDK9 elongation factor-associated protein\n*   MCEF\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   **Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry**\n    *   Tests of AFF4\n*   **Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n    *   PubMed\n*   **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n    *   ALF TRANSCRIPTION ELONGATION FACTOR 4; AFF4\n*   **Gene and Variant Databases**\n    *   NCBI Gene\n    *   ClinVar\n\n**References**\n\n1.

This enzyme is active in lysosomes, which are structures inside cells that act as recycling centers. Within lysosomes, the enzyme helps break down complex chains of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) attached to certain proteins (glycoproteins). Specifically, this enzyme cuts (cleaves) glycoproteins between a protein building block (amino acid) called asparagine and a sugar molecule called N-acetylglucosamine. This cut is one of the last steps in breaking down a glycoprotein in the lysosome.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nAspartylglucosaminuria\n\n* Many variants (also known as mutations) in the AGA gene have been found to cause aspartylglucosaminuria.

This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of a complex sugar called glycogen, which is a major source of stored energy in the body. Glycogen is made up of several molecules of a simple sugar called glucose. Some glucose molecules are linked together in a straight line, while others branch off and form side chains. The branched structure of glycogen makes it more compact for storage and allows it to break down more easily when it is needed for fuel.\n\nThe AGL gene provides instructions for making several different versions (isoforms) of the glycogen debranching enzyme.

  "2dffe9bdb0f1cecfa38da6fe05228440": "**AGTR1 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe AGTR1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1 receptor). This protein is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure and the balance of fluids and salts in the body. Through a series of steps, the renin-angiotensin system produces a molecule called angiotensin II, which attaches (binds) to the AT1 receptor, stimulating chemical signaling. This signaling causes blood vessels to narrow (constrict), which results in increased blood pressure. Binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor also stimulates production of the hormone aldosterone, which triggers the absorption of water and salt by the kidneys. The increased amount of fluid in the body also increases blood pressure. Proper blood pressure during fetal growth, which delivers oxygen to the developing tissues, is required for normal development of the kidneys, particularly of structures called the proximal tubules, and other tissues. In addition, angiotensin II may play a more direct role in kidney development, perhaps by affecting growth factors involved in the development of kidney structures.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Renal Tubular Dysgenesis**\n    At least four mutations in the AGTR1 gene have been found to cause a severe kidney disorder called renal tubular dysgenesis. This condition is characterized by abnormal kidney development before birth, the inability to produce urine (anuria), and severe low blood pressure (hypotension). These problems result in a reduction of amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios), which leads to a set of birth defects known as the Potter sequence.\n    Renal tubular dysgenesis can be caused by mutations in both copies of any of the genes involved in the renin-angiotensin system. The AGTR1 gene mutations that cause this disorder likely change or block the AT1 receptor's ability to stimulate signaling, which results in a nonfunctional renin-angiotensin system. Without this system, the kidneys cannot control blood pressure. Because of low blood pressure, the flow of blood is reduced (hypoperfusion), and the body does not get enough oxygen during fetal development. As a result, kidney development is impaired, leading to the features of renal tubular dysgenesis.\n*   **Hypertension**\n    MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Hypertension\n\n---\n\n**AGTR1 Gene**\n\n**Category:** diseases\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nVariations in the AGTR1 gene have been reported to be associated with an increased risk of a form of high blood pressure (hypertension) called essential hypertension; heart disease; or diabetic nephropathy, a complication of diabetes that affects kidney function. These are complex disorders associated with many genetic and environmental factors.\n\n*   The most studied AGTR1 gene variation associated with these conditions changes a single DNA building block (nucleotide) in the gene.\n*   This change switches the nucleotide adenine to cytosine at position 1166 in the gene (written as A1166C).\n*   It is unclear how this AGTR1 gene variation contributes to the risk of these conditions.\n\n**Renal Tubular Dysgenesis**\n\nAt least four mutations in the AGTR1 gene have been found to cause a severe kidney disorder called renal tubular dysgenesis.

  "3b50db8591fe0056deca75dd0b19a4e6": "**AGXT Gene**\n\nThe AGXT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase. This enzyme is found in liver cells, specifically within cell structures called peroxisomes. These structures are important for several cellular activities, such as ridding the cell of toxic substances and helping to break down certain fats. In the peroxisome, alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase converts a compound called glyoxylate to the protein building block (amino acid) glycine.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Primary hyperoxaluria\n  More than 175 mutations in the AGXT gene have been found to cause primary hyperoxaluria type 1. This condition is caused by the overproduction of a substance called oxalate. Excess amounts of this substance lead to kidney and bladder stones, which can begin anytime from childhood to early adulthood with kidney disease developing at any age. Deposition of oxalate in multiple other tissues throughout the body (systemic oxalosis) can cause additional health problems.\n\n  Most of the AGXT gene mutations decrease or eliminate alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity, which impairs the conversion of glyoxylate to glycine. Other mutations cause the enzyme to be misplaced in cells, transporting it to structures called mitochondria instead of to peroxisomes. While the enzyme in the mitochondria retains activity, it cannot access glyoxylate, which is in peroxisomes. All AGXT gene mutations result in the accumulation of glyoxylate, which is converted to oxalate instead of glycine. The oxalate is filtered through the kidneys and is either excreted in urine as a waste product or combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate, a hard compound that is the main component of kidney and bladder stones. Increased oxalate levels in the blood can lead to systemic oxalosis, particularly affecting bones and the walls of blood vessels in people with primary hyperoxaluria type 1.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* AGXT gene\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* More information about this health condition is available from MedlinePlus Genetics.\n\n**References**\n\n*\n\n---\n\n**AGXT Gene**\n\n**What is the AGXT Gene?**\n\nThe AGXT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase.

This enzyme is involved in a multistep process that breaks down the protein building block (amino acid) methionine. Specifically, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase controls the step that converts the compound S-adenosylhomocysteine to the compounds adenosine and homocysteine. This reaction also plays an important role in regulating the addition of methyl groups, consisting of one carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms, to other compounds (methylation). Methylation is important in many cellular processes. These include determining whether the instructions in a particular segment of DNA are carried out, regulating reactions involving proteins and lipids, and controlling the processing of chemicals that relay signals in the nervous system (neurotransmitters).\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Hypermethioninemia**\n  More than 10 variants (also known as mutations) in the AHCY gene have been described in people with hypermethioninemia. Most of these variants substitute one amino acid for another amino acid in the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase enzyme, causing it to process methionine less efficiently. Other variants introduce a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase enzyme. As a result, a shortened, nonfunctional enzyme is produced. These changes reduce the activity of the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase enzyme, impairing the breakdown of methionine. As a result, methionine builds up in the body, which is known as hypermethioninemia. In some cases, excess methionine can cause intellectual disability or other neurological problems in affected individuals.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* (No information available)\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* (No information available)\n\n**References**\n\n* (No information available)\n\n---\n\n**AHCY Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**What is the AHCY gene?**\n\nThe AHCY gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase.

  "0fecbeda3a05e9fb5cec5c9910e5626e": "**AIP Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe AIP gene provides instructions for making a protein called AH receptor-interacting protein (AIP). Although AIP's function is not well understood, it is known to interact with numerous other proteins, including one called the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.

This protein is active primarily in the thymus, which is an organ located behind the breastbone that plays an important role in immune system function. The thymus prepares immune cells called T cells for their role in fighting infection; this process is called thymic education.\n\nFor a person to remain healthy, immune system cells such as T cells must be able to identify and destroy potentially harmful invaders (such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses) while sparing the body's normal tissues. The autoimmune regulator protein plays an important role in this process by helping T cells distinguish the body's own proteins from those of foreign invaders. When this system malfunctions, the immune system's ability to distinguish between the body's proteins and foreign invaders is impaired, and it may attack the body's own tissues and organs. This abnormal reaction is called autoimmunity. In the thymus, the autoimmune regulator protein destroys T cells that otherwise would cause autoimmune damage.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nAutoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) is an inherited condition that affects many of the body's organs. A major feature of this disorder is chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), which is a tendency to develop infections of the skin, the nails, and the moist lining of body cavities (mucous membranes) caused by a type of fungus called Candida.\n\nMore than 90 mutations in the AIRE gene have been identified in people with APECED. These mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the autoimmune regulator protein or change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in critical regions of the protein. These mutations reduce or eliminate the function of the autoimmune regulator protein.\n\nWithout enough of this protein function, the immune system's ability to distinguish between the body's proteins and foreign invaders is impaired, and immune cells may attack the body's own organs, resulting in autoimmunity. This abnormal reaction leads to inflammation and can damage otherwise healthy cells and tissues. Autoimmune damage to the adrenal glands, parathyroid glands, and other organs underlies many of the major features of APECED.\n\nStudies suggest that AIRE gene mutations also result in immune substances (antibodies) mistakenly attacking proteins involved in an immune process called the IL-17 pathway, which is important in the body's defense against Candida. This pathway creates inflammation, sending additional cytokines and white blood cells to fight foreign invaders and promote tissue repair.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* \n* \n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* \n* \n\n**References**\n\n*\n\n---\n\n**AIRE Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy-Candidiasis-Ectodermal Dystrophy (APECED)**\n\n\\n\\n\n* **Causes**: More than 90 mutations in the AIRE gene have been identified in people with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED).\n* **Description**: APECED is an inherited condition that affects many of the body's organs.

These polymorphisms alter single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the AKT1 gene. It is unknown whether the genetic changes have an effect on the structure or function of AKT1 kinase, and if so, how they are related to the development of schizophrenia.\n\n**Proteus Syndrome**\n\nAt least one mutation in the AKT1 gene has been found to cause Proteus syndrome, a rare condition characterized by overgrowth of the bones, skin, and other tissues. This mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in AKT1 kinase. Specifically, it replaces the amino acid glutamic acid with the amino acid lysine at protein position 17 (written as Glu17Lys or E17K). The mutation is not inherited from a parent; in people with Proteus syndrome, the mutation arises randomly in one cell during the early stages of development before birth. As cells continue to grow and divide, some cells will have the mutation and other cells will not. This mixture of cells with and without a genetic mutation is known as mosaicism.\n\nThe Glu17Lys mutation leads to the production of an overactive AKT1 kinase that is turned on when it should not be. The abnormally active protein disrupts a cell's ability to regulate its own growth, allowing the cell to grow and divide abnormally. Increased cell proliferation in various tissues and organs leads to the overgrowth characteristic of Proteus syndrome.\n\n**Cowden Syndrome**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Cowden syndrome.\n\n**Ovarian Cancer**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Ovarian cancer.\n\n**Schizophrenia**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Schizophrenia.\n\n**Cancers**\n\nThe Glu17Lys mutation in the AKT1 gene (described above) has also been found in a small percentage of breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers. In these cases the mutation is somatic, which means it is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in tumor cells. The mutation abnormally activates AKT1 kinase, allowing cells to grow and divide without control or order. This disordered cell proliferation leads to the development of cancerous tumors.\n\nAlthough the Glu17Lys mutation has been reported in only a few types of cancer, increased activity (expression) of the AKT1 gene is found in many types of cancer.\n\n---\n\n**AKT1 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\nThe AKT1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called AKT1 kinase, which is involved in many cellular processes including cell growth and division. Variations (polymorphisms) in the AKT1 gene have been found more often in people with schizophrenia than in those without the disease.\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\n* Several common variations (polymorphisms) in the AKT1 gene have been found more often in people with schizophrenia than in those without the disease.\n* These polymorphisms alter single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the AKT1 gene.

The AKT3 protein is a key regulator of a chemical signaling pathway called the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. This signaling influences many critical cell functions, including:\n\n* Creation (synthesis) of new proteins\n* Cell growth and division (proliferation)\n* Survival of cells\n\nThe PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is essential for the normal development of many parts of the body, including the brain. Studies suggest that the AKT3 protein plays a critical role in determining brain size.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nSeveral mutations in the AKT3 gene have been found to cause megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome. This rare condition affects the development of the brain, causing an unusually large brain and head size (megalencephaly) and other abnormalities of the brain's structure.\n\n* Each of the known mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the AKT3 protein.\n* These changes are described as \"gain-of-function\" because they increase the activity of the protein.\n* This enhanced activity increases chemical signaling through the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, which causes excessive cell growth and division.\n\nThe increased number of cells leads to rapid and abnormal brain growth starting before birth.\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nChanges involving the AKT3 gene are also involved in other disorders of brain growth. These include:\n\n* Megalencephaly without the other features of MPPH syndrome (described above), which has been associated with gain-of-function AKT3 gene mutations or extra copies (duplication) of the region of chromosome 1 containing the AKT3 gene.\n* Microcephaly, which is an unusually small brain and head size. This condition is caused by a deletion of the AKT3 gene or a loss of the region of chromosome 1 containing the AKT3 gene.\n* Isolated hemimegalencephaly, which is a brain malformation that causes an enlargement of one of the two major halves (hemispheres) of the cerebrum.\n\nThese genetic changes can lead to increased cell growth and division in the developing brain.\n\n---\n\n**AKT3 Gene**\n\n**What is the AKT3 gene?**\n\nThe AKT3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called AKT3, which is involved in signaling pathways that control cell growth and division.

  "0298b1c61a48ed902569e4d8a66d6cfc": "**ALAD Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\nThe **ALAD gene** provides instructions for making an enzyme known as delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase. This enzyme is involved in the production of a molecule called heme. Heme is vital for all of the body's organs, although it is found mostly in the blood, bone marrow, and liver. Heme is an essential component of several iron-containing proteins called hemoproteins, including hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the blood).\n\nThe production of heme is a multi-step process that requires eight different enzymes. Delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase is responsible for the second step in this process, which combines two molecules of delta-aminolevulinic acid (the product of the first step) to form a compound called porphobilinogen. In subsequent steps, four molecules of porphobilinogen are combined and then modified to produce heme.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Porphyria**\n  At least 10 mutations in the ALAD gene can cause a rare form of porphyria called ALAD deficiency porphyria. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase. These changes reduce the activity of the enzyme, allowing delta-aminolevulinic acid to build up to toxic levels in the body. This compound is formed during the normal process of heme production, but reduced activity of delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase allows it to accumulate to toxic levels. Very high levels of this compound can cause attacks of abdominal pain, vomiting, and other signs and symptoms of ALAD deficiency porphyria.\n* **Other Disorders**\n  A common variation (polymorphism) in the ALAD gene may affect the risk of developing lead poisoning in people exposed to environmental lead. Lead is a heavy metal that is toxic when inhaled or ingested. Lead poisoning can cause significant health problems involving the nervous system, blood, kidneys, and reproductive system.\n  The ALAD variation that has been studied most extensively replaces the amino acid glycine with the amino acid cysteine at position 177 in delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase (written as Gly177Cys or G177C). This variation may influence the amount of lead in a person's blood and bones.

These mutations lead to an overproduction of ALA, which is then converted into porphyrins that build up in red blood cells and cause sensitivity to sunlight.\n* **X-linked Sideroblastic Anemia**: Over 50 mutations in the ALAS2 gene have been identified as causing X-linked sideroblastic anemia. These mutations impair the activity of the ALAS-E enzyme, leading to a reduction in heme production and a buildup of excess iron in red blood cells.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* 5-aminolevulinate synthase, erythroid-specific, mitochondrial\n* Erythroid ALAS-E aminolevulinate, delta-, synthase 2\n* ANH1\n* ASB\n* HEM0_HUMAN\n\n**References**\n\n* Ajioka RS, Phillips JD, Kushner JP.

This protein is found in cell structures called mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers of cells. P5CS appears to be important for mitochondrial function, and it plays a role in the formation (synthesis) of the protein building block (amino acid) proline.\n\nThe formation of proline is a multi-step process that converts the amino acid glutamate to the amino acid proline. The P5CS protein carries out the first step in this process by converting the amino acid glutamate to glutamate 5-semialdehyde. Subsequent steps convert this intermediate product to the amino acid proline. The conversion of glutamate to proline is important in maintaining a supply of the amino acids needed for protein production and for energy transfer within the cell.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*Cutis Laxa*\n\nVariants (also known as mutations) in the ALDH18A1 gene can cause two different types of cutis laxa: autosomal dominant cutis laxa type 3 (ADCL3) and autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 3A (ARCL3A, which is also known as de Barsy syndrome).\n\nIn autosomal dominant cutis laxa, one copy of the altered ALDH18A1 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the characteristic features of the disorder. In autosomal recessive cutis laxa, both copies of the gene in each cell must be altered to result in the condition.\n\nThese types of cutis laxa feature:\n\n* Loose, wrinkled, and sagging skin that is often described as parchment-like\n* Prominent veins\n* Loose joints\n* Clouding of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts) or other eye abnormalities\n* Intellectual disability\n* Movement problems that can worsen over time\n\nAutosomal recessive cutis laxa tends to be more severe than autosomal dominant.\n\nMost ALDH18A1 gene variants involved in cutis laxa result in production of a P5CS protein with reduced activity. Some studies suggest that in ADCL3, the abnormal protein from the altered copy of the gene interferes with the protein produced from the normal copy, further reducing the activity of this protein in cells.\n\nWhile the amount of proline is reduced in some people with ALDH18A1 gene variants, the levels are normal in other affected individuals. Impairment of the P5CS protein may disrupt mitochondrial function, which could lead to the death of skin and nerve cells. However, it is unclear exactly how changes in the ALDH18A1 gene lead to the particular signs and symptoms of cutis laxa.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* aldehyde dehydrogenase 18 family member A1\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*References*\n\n*More About This Health Condition*\n\n---\n\n**ALDH18A1 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nVariants in the ALDH18A1 gene can cause autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia type 9A (SPG9A) and autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 9B (SPG9B).

This enzyme is found in the energy-producing centers of cells (mitochondria). Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase is involved in the breakdown of a chemical that transmits signals in the brain (neurotransmitter) called gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA). The primary role of GABA is to prevent the brain from being overloaded with too many signals. Once GABA molecules have been released from nerve cells, they are broken down by succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase and other enzymes.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Succinic Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency**\n  Variants (also called mutations) in the ALDH5A1 gene have been found to cause succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency. This is a disorder that can cause a variety of neurological problems. Most of the variants that cause this condition lead to the production of an enzyme with little or no activity. A lack of functional succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase disrupts the conversion of succinic semialdehyde to succinic acid. Instead, succinic semialdehyde is converted back into GABA or a related molecule, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). It is unclear how increases in GHB and GABA cause developmental delays, seizures, and other features of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.\n\n  Research has shown that people with ALDH5A1 gene variants that result in a lack of functional succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase tend to have more severe signs and symptoms than people who have gene variants that impair protein activity.\n\n---\n\n**ALDH5A1 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**What is the ALDH5A1 gene?**\n\nThe ALDH5A1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase.

This enzyme is one of a group of three aldolase enzymes that are responsible for breaking down certain molecules in cells throughout the body. Four identical aldolase B enzymes need to be attached (bound) to each other in a four-enzyme unit called a tetramer to work.\n\nAldolase B is found primarily in the liver, but it is also present at lower levels in kidney and intestinal cells. Aldolase B is involved in the breakdown (metabolism) of the simple sugar fructose, which is found mostly in fruits and is used in the body for energy. Aldolase B is responsible for the second step in the metabolism of fructose, which breaks down the molecule fructose-1-phosphate into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. To a lesser degree, aldolase B is also involved in the breakdown of the simple sugar glucose.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Hereditary Fructose Intolerance\n  More than 50 mutations in the ALDOB gene have been found to cause hereditary fructose intolerance, a condition characterized by nausea and intestinal discomfort following ingestion of foods containing fructose. Most of these mutations replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the aldolase B enzyme and result in the production of an enzyme with reduced function.\n  A mutation found in approximately half of people with hereditary fructose intolerance replaces the amino acid alanine with the amino acid proline at position 149 in the enzyme (written as Ala149Pro or A149P). This mutation alters the 3-dimensional shape of the enzyme. Alteration of the shape of the enzyme makes it difficult for the aldolase B enzymes to bind together and form tetramers. If it is not in a tetramer, aldolase B cannot metabolize fructose.\n  A lack of functional aldolase B results in an accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate in liver cells. This buildup is toxic, resulting in the death of liver cells over time.

The signs and symptoms of ALG6-CDG vary widely among people with the condition.\n\nIndividuals with ALG6-CDG typically develop signs and symptoms of the condition during infancy. They may have difficulty gaining weight and growing at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Affected infants often have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and developmental delay.\n\nPeople with ALG6-CDG may have seizures, problems with coordination and balance (ataxia), or stroke-like episodes that involve an extreme lack of energy (lethargy) and temporary paralysis. They may also develop blood clotting disorders. Some individuals with ALG6-CDG have eye abnormalities including eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus) and an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa, which causes vision loss. Females with ALG6-CDG have hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, which affects the production of hormones that direct sexual development. As a result, most females with ALG6-CDG do not go through puberty.\n\n**Frequency**\n\\n\\n\nThe prevalence of ALG6-CDG is unknown, but it is thought to be the second most common type of congenital disorder of glycosylation.

Receptor tyrosine kinases transmit signals from the cell surface into the cell through a process called signal transduction. The process begins when the kinase is stimulated at the cell surface and then attaches to a similar kinase (dimerizes). After dimerization, the kinase is tagged with a marker called a phosphate group (a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms) in a process called phosphorylation. Phosphorylation turns on (activates) the kinase. The activated kinase is able to transfer a phosphate group to another protein inside the cell, which is activated as a result. The activation continues through a series of proteins in a signaling pathway. These signaling pathways are important in many cellular processes such as cell growth and division (proliferation) or maturation (differentiation).\n\nAlthough the specific function of ALK receptor tyrosine kinase is unknown, it is thought to act early in development to help regulate the proliferation of nerve cells.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   Neuroblastoma\n    *   At least 16 mutations in the ALK gene have been identified in some people with neuroblastoma, a type of cancerous tumor composed of immature nerve cells (neuroblasts).\n    *   Mutations in the ALK gene change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in ALK receptor tyrosine kinase.\n    *   The most common mutation in neuroblastoma replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid glutamine at position 1275 (written as Arg1275Gln or R1275Q).\n    *   Occasionally, extra copies of the ALK gene are found in people with neuroblastoma.\n\n---\n\n**ALK Gene**\n\nThe **ALK gene** is a type of gene that can be involved in various cancers.

These rearrangements are somatic mutations, which means they occur during a person's lifetime and are present only in the cells that become cancerous.\n\n*   **Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL)**: At least 15 translocations involving the ALK gene have been identified in people with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), a rare form of cancer involving immune cells called T cells.\n*   **Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor (IMT)**: At least seven translocations involving the ALK gene have been identified in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT). IMT is a rare cancer characterized by a solid tumor composed of inflammatory cells and cells called myofibroblasts that are important in wound healing.\n*   **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer**: A small group of people with non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung cancer, have an inversion of chromosome 2.

Researchers believe that the protein may play a role in hearing, vision, regulation of body weight, and functions of the heart, kidney, lungs, and liver. It may also affect how the pancreas regulates insulin, a hormone that helps control levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar.\n\nThe **ALMS1 protein** is present in most of the body's tissues, usually at low levels. Within cells, this protein is located in structures called centrosomes. Centrosomes play a role in cell division and the assembly of microtubules, which are proteins that transport materials in cells and help the cell maintain its shape. The **ALMS1 protein** is also found at the base of cilia, which are finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. Almost all cells have cilia at some stage of their life cycle. Cilia are involved in cell movement and many different chemical signaling pathways. Based on its location within cells, researchers suggest that the **ALMS1 protein** might be involved in the organization of microtubules, the transport of various materials, and the normal function of cilia.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nAlström syndrome is a health condition associated with mutations in the **ALMS1 gene**. More than 80 mutations have been identified in people with Alström syndrome. Most of these mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small version of the **ALMS1 protein** that does not function properly.\n\n*   The lack of normally functioning **ALMS1 protein** in the brain may cause overeating.\n*   A loss of this protein in the pancreas may cause insulin resistance, a condition in which the body cannot use insulin properly.\n*   The combined effects of overeating and insulin resistance impair the body's ability to handle excess glucose, leading to diabetes and obesity (two common features of Alström syndrome).\n*   It is unclear how **ALMS1** mutations cause the other signs and symptoms of Alström syndrome.

This enzyme plays an important role in the growth and development of bones and teeth. It is also active in many other tissues, particularly in the liver and kidneys. This enzyme acts as a phosphatase, which means that it removes clusters of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (phosphate groups) from other molecules.\n\nTNSALP is essential for the process of mineralization, in which minerals such as calcium and phosphorus are deposited in developing bones and teeth. Mineralization is critical for the formation of bones that are strong and rigid and teeth that can withstand chewing and grinding.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nHypophosphatasia\n* About 300 mutations in the **ALPL** gene have been identified in people with hypophosphatasia.\n* Most of these mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in TNSALP.

Alsin is produced in a wide range of tissues, with highest amounts in the brain. This protein is particularly abundant in motor neurons, the specialized nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control the movement of muscles.\n\nAlsin turns on (activates) multiple proteins called GTPases that convert a molecule called GTP into another molecule called GDP. GTPases play important roles in cell division, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). The GTPases play important roles in several cell processes. The GTPases that are activated by alsin are involved in the proper placement of the various proteins and fats that make up the cell membrane, the transport of molecules from the cell membrane to the interior of the cell (endocytosis), and the development of specialized structures called axons and dendrites that project from neurons and are essential for the transmission of nerve impulses.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis**\n  * MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n  * More About This Health Condition\n* **Infantile-onset ascending hereditary spastic paralysis**\n  * At least 20 ALS2 gene mutations have been found to cause infantile-onset ascending hereditary spastic paralysis.\n  * This disorder is characterized by progressive weakness and stiffness of muscles in the legs, arms, neck, and head that begins within the first 2 years of life.\n  * Mutations in the ALS2 gene alter the instructions for making alsin, often resulting in the production of an abnormally short alsin protein that is unstable and rapidly broken down.\n  * It is unclear exactly how ALS2 gene mutations cause infantile-onset ascending hereditary spastic paralysis.

This test is commonly used to help diagnose liver damage or disease.\n\nALT (alanine transaminase) is an enzyme, a protein that speeds up certain chemical reactions in your body. It is found mainly in your liver. Usually, you will have low levels of ALT in your blood. But when liver cells are damaged, they release ALT into the bloodstream. High levels of ALT in your blood may be a sign of a liver injury or disease. Some types of liver disease cause high ALT levels even before you have symptoms of the disease. So, an ALT blood test may help diagnose certain liver diseases early, when they may be easier to treat.\n\nAn ALT test is usually ordered as part of a group of liver function tests.\n\n* Other names: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Serum Glutamic-Pyruvic Transaminase (SGPT), GPT, Alanine Transaminase\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nAn ALT blood test is often part of a routine blood screening to check the health of your liver. The test may also help diagnose or monitor liver problems.\n\n**Why do I need an ALT Blood Test?**\n\nYour health care provider may order an ALT blood test as part of a routine checkup. An ALT test is usually done with a group of other liver function tests that check how well your liver is working. Many liver function tests are included in a common blood test called a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP).\n\n* These tests may also be ordered if you have symptoms of liver damage, such as:\n  * Nausea and vomiting\n  * Lack of appetite\n  * Fatigue\n  * Weakness\n  * Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow\n  * Swelling and/or pain in your abdomen (belly)\n  * Swelling in your ankles and legs\n  * Dark-colored urine (pee) and/or light-colored stool (poop)\n  * Frequent itching\n\nYour provider may also order an ALT blood test if you have a high risk of liver damage because of:\n\n* A family history of liver disease\n* Alcohol use disorder (AUD)\n* Obesity\n* Diabetes\n* Taking certain medicines that can cause liver damage\n* Hepatitis or exposure to hepatitis\n\n**What happens during an ALT Blood Test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou may need to stop taking certain medicines before the test, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\nAn ALT test is usually ordered with other blood tests. You usually need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before these tests. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nAn ALT blood test is often done as part of a group of liver function tests. Liver function tests measure several different proteins, substances, and enzymes that show how well your liver is working. Your provider usually compares your ALT results with the results of the other liver tests to evaluate your liver health and decide if you need other tests to make a diagnosis.\n\n* Lower-than-usual levels of ALT in your blood are not common. Your provider may do more tests since this may be a sign of:\n  * B6 deficiency\n  * Chronic kidney disease\n\nHigher-than-usual levels of ALT in your blood may be a sign of liver damage from:\n\n* Hepatitis\n* Infection\n* Cirrhosis\n* Liver cancer\n* Other liver diseases\n* A lack of blood flow to the liver\n* Certain medicines, such as cholesterol or pain medicines\n* Poisons\n\nIf your results show you have a high level of ALT, it doesn't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Many things can affect your results, such as your age, sex, weight, and certain medicines and dietary supplements. Your ALT levels can also be affected by intense exercise and where you are in your menstrual cycle.\n\nTo learn what your results mean, talk with your provider.\n\n**Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.**\n\n**Is there anything else I need to know about an ALT Blood Test?**\n\nALT test results may help tell the difference between damage from acute (sudden) liver problems and chronic (long-term) liver problems. But the amount of ALT in your blood isn't related to how much your liver may be damaged.\n\nYour ALT is usually measured along with another liver enzyme called AST as part of a liver function panel. Since ALT is mostly found in the liver, an ALT test checks more specifically for liver damage.\n\n---\n\n**ALT Blood Test**\n\n**What is an ALT Blood Test?**\n\nAn ALT blood test measures the level of alanine transaminase (ALT) in your blood. ALT is a liver enzyme that can be elevated when there is liver damage.\n\n**When is an ALT Blood Test Ordered?**\n\nYour provider may order an ALT blood test if you have a high risk of liver damage because of:\n\n* A family history of liver disease\n* Alcohol use disorder (AUD)\n* Obesity\n* Diabetes\n* Taking certain medicines that can cause liver damage\n* Hepatitis or exposure to hepatitis\n\n**What Happens During an ALT Blood Test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle.

Homeobox proteins direct the formation of body structures during early embryonic development. The ALX1 protein is necessary for normal development of the head and face, particularly the formation of the eyes, nose, and mouth, which begins around the fourth week of development. The ALX1 protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to DNA and controls the activity of certain genes.

Homeobox proteins direct the formation of body structures during early embryonic development. The ALX4 protein is necessary for normal development of the skull and formation of the head and face, which begins early in fetal development. This protein is also involved in the formation of skin layers, but its role in this process is poorly understood.\n\nThe ALX4 protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to DNA and controls the activity of certain genes. Specifically, the protein controls the activity of genes that regulate cell growth and division (proliferation), cell maturation and specialization (differentiation), cell movement (migration), and cell survival. The regulation of these functions ensures that cells start and stop growing at specific times and that they are positioned correctly during development.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Enlarged Parietal Foramina**\n  At least eight mutations in the ALX4 gene have been found to cause enlarged parietal foramina type 2. This condition is characterized by enlarged openings (foramina) in the parietal bones, which are the two bones that form the top and sides of the skull. Openings in the parietal bones are normal during fetal development, but they usually close before birth. In people with this condition, the parietal foramina remain open throughout life.\n\n  The mutations that cause enlarged parietal foramina result in the production of an ALX4 protein that cannot bind to DNA, which alters the regulation of multiple genes. As a result, several cell processes are disrupted, including proliferation, differentiation, and survival. In early development, the skull seems to be particularly sensitive to changes in ALX4 protein activity. Specifically, cells in the skull that are involved in bone formation (ossification) cannot function normally, leading to a lack of bone in areas of the skull and resulting in enlarged parietal foramina.\n\n* **Frontonasal Dysplasia**\n  At least four mutations in the ALX4 gene have been found to cause frontonasal dysplasia. ALX4 gene mutations cause a form of the disorder called frontonasal dysplasia type 2. In addition to facial malformations, this type can include features such as genital abnormalities in males, hair loss (alopecia), and enlarged parietal foramina (described above).\n\n  The ALX4 gene mutations that cause frontonasal dysplasia type 2 severely reduce or eliminate the function of the ALX4 protein. As a result, the protein cannot bind to DNA and regulate gene function, which leads to poorly controlled cell proliferation and migration during development. This abnormal cell growth and movement leads to malformations in the middle of the face, particularly affecting the nose, which leads to openings (clefts) in the nose. This abnormal development can also interfere with the proper formation of the skull, which likely contributes to enlarged parietal foramina.\n\n  In some individuals, ALX4 gene mutations impair the function of hair follicles and lead to alopecia, but the mechanism is unclear. Because enlarged parietal foramina can be a feature of frontonasal dysplasia type 2 and because the two conditions are caused by mutations in the same gene, it is unclear whether these conditions are distinct disorders or part of a disease spectrum.\n\n---\n\n**ALX4 Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Potocki-Shaffer Syndrome**\n\nA mutation resulting in the deletion of the ALX4 gene causes a condition called Potocki-Shaffer syndrome. People with this condition have enlarged parietal foramina (described above) and multiple noncancerous bone tumors (osteochondromas). Other signs and symptoms seen in some people with Potocki-Shaffer syndrome include intellectual disability, developmental delay, distinctive facial features, vision problems, and defects in the heart, kidneys, and urinary tract.\n\nPotocki-Shaffer syndrome (also called proximal 11p deletion syndrome) is caused by a deletion of genetic material from the short (p) arm of chromosome 11. In people with this condition, a loss of the ALX4 gene within this region is responsible for enlarged parietal foramina. This feature occurs because a shortage of the ALX4 transcription factor caused by deletion of the gene disrupts several cellular processes and impairs proper bone formation (ossification). The loss of additional genes in the deleted region likely contributes to the other features of Potocki-Shaffer syndrome.\n\n* Specifically, loss of the EXT2 gene results in multiple osteochondromas.\n* Deletion of the PHF21A gene causes intellectual disability and distinctive facial features.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Enlarged Parietal Foramina**\n\nAt least eight mutations in the ALX4 gene have been found to cause enlarged parietal foramina type 2.

This enzyme is found in the energy-producing centers in cells (mitochondria) and in cell structures called peroxisomes. Peroxisomes contain a variety of enzymes that break down many different substances, including fatty acids and certain toxic compounds. They are also important for the production (synthesis) of fats (lipids) used in digestion and in the nervous system.\n\nIn peroxisomes, the AMACR enzyme plays a role in the breakdown of a fatty acid called pristanic acid, which comes from meat and dairy foods in the diet. In mitochondria, AMACR is thought to help further break down the molecules derived from pristanic acid.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nAlpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase deficiency\n  * Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) deficiency is caused by mutations in the AMACR gene.

Amelogenin is involved in the formation of enamel, which is the hard, white material that forms the protective outer layer of each tooth. Enamel is composed mainly of mineral crystals. These microscopic crystals are arranged in organized bundles that give enamel its strength and durability. Although the exact function of amelogenin is not well understood, it appears to separate and support the crystals as they grow. Amelogenin is removed from the developing crystals when it is no longer needed, leaving mature enamel that contains very little protein.\n\nOne copy of the amelogenin gene is located on each of the sex chromosomes (the X and Y chromosomes). The **AMELX** gene, which is located on the X chromosome, makes almost all of the body's amelogenin. The copy of the amelogenin gene on the Y chromosome, **AMELY**, makes very little amelogenin and is not needed for enamel formation.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Amelogenesis imperfecta\n  At least 23 mutations in the **AMELX** gene have been identified in people with an X-linked form of a disorder of tooth development called amelogenesis imperfecta. (X-linked disorders are caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome.) Some **AMELX** gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormal version of the amelogenin protein that can interfere with the formation and organization of enamel crystals. Other **AMELX** gene mutations prevent one copy of the gene from producing any amelogenin protein at all. Enamel cannot form properly without an adequate amount of amelogenin.\n\nMales have a single copy of the X chromosome in each cell. Males who inherit an altered copy of the **AMELX** gene have very little amelogenin and develop almost no enamel to cover and protect their teeth. (The normal **AMELY** gene on the Y chromosome does not provide enough amelogenin to compensate.) Females have two copies of the X chromosome in each cell. Females who inherit one altered copy of the **AMELX** gene are less severely affected than males because they have a normal copy of the gene on the other X chromosome to produce amelogenin. Their tooth enamel may have structural defects such as a distinctive pattern of vertical grooves.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* No information available\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* No information available\n\n**References**\n\n* No information available\n\n---\n\n**AMELX Gene**\n\n**What is the AMELX gene?**\n\nThe AMELX gene provides instructions for making a protein called amelogenin, which is essential for the formation of tooth enamel.\n\n**How does the AMELX gene affect health?**\n\nMutations in the AMELX gene can lead to a disorder of tooth development called amelogenesis imperfecta.

Wnt signaling is important for cell division, attachment of cells to one another (adhesion), cell movement (migration), and many other cell activities.\n\nThe AMER1 protein can promote cell growth by helping to turn on (activate) the Wnt pathway or prevent cell growth by helping to turn off (repress) the Wnt pathway. When repressing the pathway, the AMER1 protein is acting as a tumor suppressor, which means that it helps prevent cells from growing and dividing (proliferating) too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Wilms Tumor\n  Mutations in the AMER1 gene have been found in Wilms tumor, a rare form of kidney cancer that occurs almost exclusively in children. These mutations are somatic, meaning that they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in kidney cells that give rise to the tumor. AMER1 gene mutations result in a protein with a reduced ability to repress Wnt signaling. As a result, Wnt signaling is increased, which leads to the unchecked proliferation of kidney cells and tumor development.\n\n* Other Disorders\n  Mutations in the AMER1 gene that are present in cells throughout the body (called germline mutations) cause a bone disorder called osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis. This condition occurs almost exclusively in females because males with the disorder usually die before or soon after birth.

Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). Females can be carriers of the mutation without showing symptoms because they have another copy of the gene to compensate for the mutated gene. Males are more likely to show symptoms if they inherit the mutated gene.\n\n\\n\\n**Other names for this condition**\n\n* Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome\n* AMHR2-related disorder\n\n\\n\\n**Genetic counseling**\n\nGenetic counseling is recommended for individuals and families affected by this condition.

This protein is involved in the uptake of vitamin B12 (also called cobalamin) from food. Vitamin B12, which cannot be made in the body and can only be obtained from food, is essential for the formation of DNA and proteins, the production of cellular energy, and the breakdown of fats. This vitamin is involved in the formation of red blood cells and maintenance of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).\n\nThe amnionless protein is primarily found embedded in the outer membrane of kidney cells and cells that line the small intestine. Amnionless attaches (binds) to another protein called cubilin, anchoring cubilin to the cell membrane. Cubilin can interact with molecules and proteins passing through the intestine or kidneys. During digestion, vitamin B12 is released from food. As the vitamin passes through the small intestine, cubilin binds to it. Amnionless helps transfer the cubilin-vitamin B12 complex into the intestinal cell. From there, the vitamin is released into the blood and transported throughout the body. In the kidneys, amnionless and cubilin are involved in the reabsorption of certain proteins that would otherwise be released in urine.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nImerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome\n  * At least 30 mutations in the AMN gene have been found to cause Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome.\n  * This condition is characterized by low levels of vitamin B12 in the body, which leads to a blood disorder known as megaloblastic anemia.\n  * About half of affected individuals also have excess protein in their urine (proteinuria), and some have neurological problems.\n\nAMN gene mutations that cause Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome reduce the amount or function of the amnionless protein. Without amnionless acting as an anchor, cubilin is not attached to cells in the small intestine or kidneys and cannot bind to vitamin B12 and other molecules and proteins needed in the body. As a result, instead of being taken into intestinal cells, vitamin B12 is released from the body. A shortage of this essential vitamin impairs the proper development of red blood cells, leading to megaloblastic anemia. Low levels of vitamin B12 can also affect the central nervous system, causing neurological problems.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* (no information available)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* (no information available)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n* (no information available)\n\n---\n\n**AMN Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Imerslund-Gräsbeck Syndrome**\n\n* Characterized by low levels of vitamin B12 in the body, leading to a blood disorder known as megaloblastic anemia.\n* About half of affected individuals also have excess protein in their urine (proteinuria), and some have neurological problems.\n\nThe AMN gene mutations that cause Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome reduce the amount or function of the amnionless protein.

This enzyme is found in the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles), where it plays a role in producing energy.\n\nSpecifically, during physical activity, this enzyme converts a molecule called adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to a molecule called inosine monophosphate (IMP) as part of a process called the purine nucleotide cycle. This cycle reuses molecules called purines, which are a group of building blocks of DNA (nucleotides), its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as AMP that serve as energy sources in the cell.\n\nAs part of the purine nucleotide cycle, AMP deaminase converts AMP to IMP, and as the cycle continues, molecules are produced that the muscle cells can use for energy. Skeletal muscle cells need energy to function and move the body.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency\n  At least nine mutations in the AMPD1 gene have been found to cause AMP deaminase deficiency. This condition is characterized by skeletal muscle pain or weakness after exercise or prolonged physical activity (exercise intolerance).\n  \n  Most cases are caused by a mutation that results in a premature stop signal in the instructions for making AMP deaminase (written as Gly12Ter or Q12X). The resulting enzyme is abnormally short and nonfunctional and cannot participate in the purine nucleotide cycle. As a result, the process stalls and energy production in skeletal muscle cells is decreased.\n\n  Skeletal muscles are particularly sensitive to decreases in energy during periods of exercise or increased activity when energy demands increase. The lack of AMP deaminase as a source of energy production can result in fatigue and muscle weakness or pain in some people with AMP deaminase deficiency.\n\n  It is not known why some people with this condition do not experience symptoms. Researchers speculate that additional factors, both genetic and environmental, may determine whether a person develops the signs and symptoms of AMP deaminase deficiency.\n\n---\n\n**AMPD1 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**What is AMPD1 Gene?**\nThe AMPD1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called adenosine monophosphate deaminase, which plays a crucial role in energy production in skeletal muscle cells.

This protein is one of four enzymes that work together in a group called the glycine cleavage system. Within cells, this system is active in specialized energy-producing centers called mitochondria.\n\nAs its name suggests, the glycine cleavage system breaks down a molecule called glycine by cutting (cleaving) it into smaller pieces. Glycine is an amino acid, which is a building block of proteins. This molecule also acts as a neurotransmitter, which is a chemical messenger that transmits signals in the brain. The breakdown of excess glycine when it is no longer needed is necessary for the normal development and function of nerve cells in the brain.\n\nThe breakdown of glycine by the glycine cleavage system produces a molecule called a methyl group. This molecule is added to and used by a vitamin called folate. Folate is required for many functions in the cell and is important for brain development.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Nonketotic hyperglycinemia\n  * Mutations in the AMT gene account for about 20 percent of all cases of nonketotic hyperglycinemia.\n  * This condition is characterized by abnormally high levels of glycine in the body (hyperglycinemia).\n  * Affected individuals have serious neurological problems, including severe breathing difficulties shortly after birth, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures, and delayed development of milestones.\n  * More than 70 mutations have been identified in affected individuals.

Affected individuals have serious neurological problems. The signs and symptoms of the condition vary in severity and can include severe breathing difficulties shortly after birth as well as weak muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures, and delayed development of milestones.\n\n**Causes**\n\nMutations in the AMT gene account for about 20 percent of all cases of nonketotic hyperglycinemia. More than 70 mutations have been identified in affected individuals. Most of these genetic changes alter single amino acids in aminomethyltransferase. Other mutations delete genetic material from the AMT gene or disrupt how genetic information from the gene is spliced together to make a blueprint for producing aminomethyltransferase.\n\n**AMT Gene Mutations**\n\nAMT gene mutations alter the structure and function of aminomethyltransferase. When an altered version of this enzyme is incorporated into the glycine cleavage system, it impairs the system's ability to break down glycine. Some AMT gene mutations reduce the activity of the glycine cleavage system, while others completely eliminate its activity. As a result, excess glycine can build up in the body's organs and tissues. In addition, the production of methyl groups for use by folate is reduced.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* GCE glycine cleavage system protein T NKH\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry\n  * Tests of AMT\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed\n  * PubMed\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n  * AMINOMETHYLTRANSFERASE; AMT\n* Gene and Variant Databases\n  * NCBI Gene\n  * ClinVar\n\n**References**\n\n1.

These antibodies are proteins made by your immune system to fight foreign substances, but an antinuclear antibody attacks healthy cells instead.\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nAn ANA test is used to help diagnose autoimmune disorders, such as:\n\n* Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a chronic disease that affects many parts of the body\n* Rheumatoid arthritis, a condition that causes pain and swelling in joints\n* Scleroderma, a rare disease that may affect the skin, blood vessels, and organs\n* Sjögren's syndrome, a rare disease that affects glands that make tears and saliva\n* Addison Disease, which affects adrenal glands and causes fatigue and weakness\n* Autoimmune hepatitis, which causes swelling in the liver\n* Thyroid diseases, which can cause thyroid hormone imbalances\n\n**Why do I need an ANA test?**\n\nYour health care provider may order an ANA test if you have symptoms of an autoimmune disorder, such as:\n\n* Fever\n* Rash, blisters, or skin color changes\n* Fatigue\n* Joint pain, stiffness, and swelling\n* Muscle pain\n* Swollen glands\n* Abdominal (belly) pain\n\n**What happens during an ANA test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle. The procedure usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\nSome medicines may affect the results of your ANA test, so you may need to stop taking certain medications before the test. Tell your provider about everything you take.\n\n**Risks and Results**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the needle site, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\nResults from an ANA test alone cannot diagnose a specific disease. Your provider will use your ANA test results along with other tests and information about your health to make a diagnosis.\n\n* A negative result means antinuclear antibodies were not found in your blood, and you're less likely to have an autoimmune disorder.\n* A positive result may be a sign of:\n\t+ Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)\n\t+ A different type of autoimmune disease\n\t+ A viral infection\n\t+ Another health condition that can cause antinuclear antibodies, such as cancer\n\nIf your ANA test results are positive, your provider will likely order more tests to make a diagnosis.\n\n---\n\n**What is an ANA Test?**\n\nAn ANA test, or antinuclear antibody test, is used to diagnose autoimmune disorders. Your healthcare provider may order this test if you have symptoms of an autoimmune disorder.\n\n**Symptoms of Autoimmune Disorders**\n\n* The symptoms depend on what part of your body is affected.\n* They may include:\n  * Fatigue\n  * Joint pain or swelling\n  * Skin rashes\n  * Fever\n\n**What Happens During an ANA Test?**\n\nA healthcare professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\nSome medicines may affect the results of your ANA test. You may need to stop taking certain medicines before this test, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\n**Risks of the Test**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**Understanding Your Results**\n\nResults from an ANA test alone cannot diagnose a specific disease. Your provider will use your ANA test results along with other blood and imaging tests and information about your health to make a diagnosis.\n\n* A negative result on an ANA test means that antinuclear antibodies were not found in your blood, and you're less likely to have an autoimmune disorder.\n* But a negative ANA test doesn't completely rule out the possibility that you could have an autoimmune disorder.\n* A positive result on an ANA test means that antinuclear antibodies were found in your blood. A positive result may be a sign of:\n  * Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)\n  * A different type of autoimmune disease\n  * A viral infection (antinuclear antibodies from a virus are usually only in your blood for a short time)\n  * Another health condition that can cause antinuclear antibodies, such as cancer\n\nIf your ANA test results are positive, your provider will likely order more tests to make a diagnosis.\n\n**What Does it Mean to Have Antinuclear Antibodies?**\n\nHaving antinuclear antibodies in your blood doesn't always mean you have a disease. Some healthy people have antinuclear antibodies in their blood, and levels tend to increase with age. Many healthy adults may have a positive ANA test result, especially women over the age of 65. Also, certain medicines can cause antinuclear antibodies.\n\nIf you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.\n\n**Learn More**\n\n* Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\n* Visit reputable health websites for more information on autoimmune disorders and ANA tests:\n  * American College of Rheumatology\n  * Cleveland Clinic: Health Library: Diagnostics & Testing\n  * Lupus Research Alliance\n  * Merck Manual Consumer Version\n  * Mayo Clinic\n  * National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases\n  * Nemours KidsHealth\n\n---\n\n**ANA (Antinuclear Antibody) Test**\n\n\\n\\n\n**What is an ANA test?**\nAn ANA test, also known as an antinuclear antibody test, is used to detect the presence of autoantibodies in the blood. These autoantibodies are a type of protein that mistakenly attacks healthy tissues and can be associated with various autoimmune diseases.\n\n\\n\\n\n**When is an ANA test ordered?**\nAn ANA test may be ordered when a person has symptoms or signs of an autoimmune disease, such as:\n\n* Joint pain or swelling (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis)\n* Skin rashes or lesions (e.g., lupus)\n* Fatigue or fever\n* Hair loss or skin thinning (e.g., scleroderma)\n\n\\n\\n\n**How is the ANA test performed?**\nThe ANA test involves a blood sample, which is typically drawn from a vein in the arm. The blood sample is then sent to a laboratory for analysis.\n\n\\n\\n\n**What are the results of an ANA test?**\nThe results of an ANA test can be positive or negative. A positive result indicates that autoantibodies are present in the blood, which may suggest an autoimmune disease. However, a negative result does not rule out an autoimmune disease, as some people with these conditions may not have detectable levels of autoantibodies.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Related Health Topics:**\n\n* *Autoimmune Diseases*\n* *Immune System and Disorders*\n* *Lupus*\n* *Rheumatoid Arthritis*\n* *Scleroderma*\n* *Sjogren's Syndrome*\n\n\\n\\n\n**Related Medical Tests:**\n\n* *Antibody Serology Tests*\n* *Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCA) Test*\n* *C-Reactive Protein (CRP) Test*\n* *CCP Antibody Test*\n* *Celiac Disease Screening*\n* *Cold Stimulation Test*\n* *Complement Blood Test*\n* *How to Cope with Medical Test Anxiety*\n* *How to Understand Your Lab Results*\n* *Immunoglobulins Blood Test*\n* *Rheumatoid Factor (RF) Test*\n* *Smooth Muscle Antibody (SMA) Test*\n* *What You Need to Know About Blood Testing*\n\n\\n\\n\n**Important Note:**\nThe information on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.

Ankyrin-B ensures these channels and transporters are in their proper locations in the cell membrane so they can regulate the flow of ions into and out of cardiac muscle cells.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nAnkyrin-B syndrome is a condition characterized by a variety of heart problems, including:\n\n* Abnormalities of the heart's natural pacemaker (the sinoatrial node)\n* A heart rate that is slower than normal (bradycardia)\n* A disruption in the rhythm of the heart (arrhythmia)\n* An increased risk of fainting (syncope) and sudden death\n\nAt least ten mutations in the **ANK2** gene have been found to cause ankyrin-B syndrome. Each of these mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the ankyrin-B protein, altering its function.\n\n* Most of these mutations alter a region of the ankyrin-B protein important for its function.\n* At least one **ANK2** gene mutation prevents ankyrin-B from getting to the cell membrane where it is needed to function.\n\n---\n\n**ANK2 Gene**\n\n**Category:** diseases\n\n**What is the ANK2 gene?**\n\nThe ANK2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ankyrin-B.

The ANKH protein plays a role in the development and function of cells that build bones (osteoblasts) and cells that break down bone (osteoclasts). Osteoclasts are involved in bone remodeling, a normal process in which old bone is removed and new bone is created to replace it. In addition, the ANKH protein transports a molecule called pyrophosphate out of cells to the intricate network of proteins that forms in the spaces between cells (extracellular matrix). This extracellular pyrophosphate helps regulate bone formation by preventing mineralization, the process by which minerals such as calcium and phosphorus are deposited in tissues. The ANKH protein may have other, unknown functions.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nCraniometaphyseal dysplasia is a condition characterized by thickening of bones in the skull (cranium) and widening of a region at the end of long bones known as the metaphysis. More than 10 mutations in the ANKH gene have been found to cause autosomal dominant craniometaphyseal dysplasia.\n\n*   These mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the ANKH protein, insert or delete one or more amino acids in the protein.\n*   The changes disrupt the functioning of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In particular, the maturation (differentiation) of osteoclasts is impaired, which likely disrupts bone remodeling.\n*   Reduced breakdown of bone tissue can contribute to the bone thickening characteristic of craniometaphyseal dysplasia.\n*   The altered ANKH proteins may also be less able to transport pyrophosphate out of cells.

The crystals may cause inflammation in the joints, which can be painful.\n* Most cases of CPPDD occur in people older than 40, are not inherited, and have an unknown cause.\n* However, inherited mutations in the ANKH gene have been shown to cause CPPDD in a few families. In these families, one altered copy of the ANKH gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition.\n* Individuals with familial CPPDD caused by ANKH gene mutations typically form crystal deposits within multiple joints during early adulthood.\n* Researchers believe that these mutations lead to elevated pyrophosphate levels in the extracellular matrix. High levels of pyrophosphate result in excessive formation of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals within joints.\n* Studies suggest that certain variations (polymorphisms) in the ANKH gene are associated with the normal differences in bone size and shape among individuals.\n* These polymorphisms probably result in slight changes in the activity of the ANKH protein, affecting the levels of pyrophosphate in the extracellular matrix.\n\n**Craniometaphyseal Dysplasia**\n\n* More than 10 mutations in the ANKH gene have been found to cause autosomal dominant craniometaphyseal dysplasia.\n* This condition is characterized by thickening of bones in the skull (cranium) and widening of a region at the end of long bones known as the metaphysis.\n* Some mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the ANKH protein, whereas others insert or delete one or more amino acids in the protein.\n* These changes disrupt the functioning of osteoblasts and osteoclasts.

This protein contains multiple regions called ankyrin domains; proteins with these domains help other proteins interact with each other.\n\n* **Normal Function**\n  The ANKRD11 protein interacts with certain proteins called histone deacetylases, which are important for controlling gene activity. Through these interactions, ANKRD11 affects when genes are turned on and off.\n  For example, ANKRD11 brings together histone deacetylases and other proteins called p160 coactivators. This association regulates the ability of p160 coactivators to turn on gene activity. ANKRD11 may also enhance the activity of a protein called p53, which controls the growth and division (proliferation) and the self-destruction (apoptosis) of cells.\n\n  The ANKRD11 protein is found in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. During embryonic development, ANKRD11 helps regulate the proliferation of these cells and development of the brain. Researchers speculate that the protein may also be involved in the ability of neurons to change and adapt over time (plasticity), which is important for learning and memory.\n  ANKRD11 may function in other cells in the body and appears to be involved in normal bone development.\n\n* **Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n  Several ANKRD11 gene mutations have been found to cause KBG syndrome, a condition characterized by large upper front teeth and other unusual facial features, skeletal abnormalities, and intellectual disability.\n  Most of these mutations lead to an abnormally short ANKRD11 protein, which likely has little or no function. Reduction of this protein's function is thought to underlie the signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n  Because ANKRD11 is thought to play an important role in neurons and brain development, researchers speculate that a partial loss of its function may lead to developmental delay and intellectual disability in KBG syndrome.

While the specific function of this protein is not well understood, it belongs to a family of proteins, called anoctamins, that act as chloride channels.\n\n* Chloride channels transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions) in and out of cells.\n* These channels play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.\n* Studies suggest that most anoctamin proteins function as calcium-activated chloride channels, which are turned on (activated) in the presence of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions).\n* Anoctamin proteins are also involved in maintaining the membrane that surrounds cells and repairing the membrane if it gets damaged.\n\nThe anoctamin-5 protein is most abundant in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For the body to move normally, skeletal muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. The regulation of chloride flow within muscle cells plays a role in controlling muscle contraction and relaxation.\n\nThe anoctamin-5 protein is also found in other cells including heart (cardiac) muscle cells and bone cells. Studies have suggested that the anoctamin-5 protein may be important for the development of muscle and bone before birth.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* This section is currently empty.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* This section is currently empty.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* This section is currently empty.\n\n**References**\n\n* This section is currently empty.\n\n---\n\n**ANO5 Gene**\n\nThe anoctamin-5 protein is found in various cells, including skeletal muscle cells, heart (cardiac) muscle cells, and bone cells.

This protein belongs to a family of proteins called anoctamins that act as chloride channels. Chloride channels transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions) in and out of cells, playing a key role in generating and transmitting electrical signals.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Gnathodiaphyseal Dysplasia**\n    At least three ANO5 gene mutations have been identified in people with this bone disorder. It leads to fragile bones, jaw problems, and other skeletal abnormalities.\n    The ANO5 gene mutations that cause gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the anoctamin-5 protein. Researchers suggest that these mutations may affect the way cells process calcium, an important mineral in bone development and growth.\n\n*   **Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy**\n    More than 40 mutations in the ANO5 gene have been identified in people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2L. This condition is characterized by muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy), particularly in the shoulders, hips, thighs, and upper arms.\n    The ANO5 gene mutations identified in people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2L change single amino acids in the anoctamin-5 protein sequence or disrupt how genetic information is pieced together to make a blueprint for producing the protein.\n\n*   **Miyoshi Myopathy**\n    At least 10 mutations in the ANO5 gene have been found to cause Miyoshi myopathy. This muscle disorder is characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy of muscles that are away from the center of the body (distal muscles), particularly those in the legs.\n    The ANO5 gene mutations identified in people with Miyoshi myopathy change single amino acids in the anoctamin-5 protein or result in the production of an abnormally short protein that is quickly broken down.\n\n---\n\n**ANO5 Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 3/5)**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy**\n\n*   More than 40 mutations in the ANO5 gene have been identified in people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2L.\n*   Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is a group of related disorders characterized by muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy), particularly in the shoulders, hips, thighs, and upper arms.\n\nThe ANO5 gene mutations identified in people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2L change single amino acids in the anoctamin-5 protein sequence, disrupt how genetic information is pieced together to make a blueprint for producing the protein, or result in a premature stop signal that leads to an abnormally short protein. One of the mutations adds an extra DNA building block (nucleotide) to the ANO5 gene (written as 191dupA) and is believed to be a relatively common cause of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy in people with northern European ancestry.\n\nThis mutation alters the instructions used to make the anoctamin-5 protein, leading to a premature stop signal that would produce an abnormally short protein. Instead, a cellular error-catching mechanism called nonsense-mediated decay prevents the protein from being produced at all.\n\nANO5 gene mutations that eliminate or impair the role of the anoctamin-5 protein as a chloride channel likely lead to impaired muscle function, resulting in the signs and symptoms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.\n\n**Miyoshi Myopathy**\n\n*   At least 10 mutations in the ANO5 gene have been found to cause Miyoshi myopathy.\n*   When caused by mutations in this gene, the condition is also known as distal anoctaminopathy.\n*   Miyoshi myopathy is a muscle disorder that is characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy of muscles that are away from the center of the body (distal muscles), particularly those in the legs.\n\nThe ANO5 gene mutations identified in people with Miyoshi myopathy change single amino acids in the anoctamin-5 protein or result in the production of an abnormally short protein that is quickly broken down. These mutations result in the production of little or no anoctamin-5 protein. The effects of the loss of anoctamin-5 are unclear.\n\nWhile chloride is necessary for normal muscle function, it is unknown how a lack of this chloride channel causes the signs and symptoms of Miyoshi myopathy. The 191dupA mutation that can cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (described above) is also a common cause of Miyoshi myopathy in individuals of northern European ancestry.\n\nIt is not known why the 191dupA mutation can result in different patterns of signs and symptoms. Miyoshi myopathy caused by ANO5 gene mutations is likely a variation of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy because it is caused by mutations in the same gene, and in some cases even by the same mutation.\n\n---\n\n**ANO5 Gene**\n\n\\n\\n\nThe ANO5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called anoctamin-5.

This protein is involved in development before birth. Anosmin-1 is found in the extracellular matrix, which is the intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. Anosmin-1 is active in many parts of the developing embryo, including the respiratory tract, kidneys, digestive system, and certain regions of the brain.\n\nResearchers are working to determine the functions of anosmin-1. They have discovered that, in the developing brain, this protein is involved in the movement (migration) of nerve cells and the outgrowth of axons, which are specialized extensions of nerve cells that transmit nerve impulses. The protein also plays a role in regulating contact between nerve cells (cell adhesion).\n\nAnosmin-1 appears to help control the growth and migration of a group of nerve cells that are specialized to process the sense of smell (olfactory neurons). These nerve cells originate in the developing nose and then migrate together to a structure in the front of the brain called the olfactory bulb, which is critical for the perception of odors. Studies suggest that anosmin-1 is also involved in the migration of neurons that produce a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Like olfactory neurons, GnRH-producing neurons migrate from the developing nose to the front of the brain. GnRH controls the production of several hormones that direct sexual development before birth and during puberty. These hormones are important for the normal function of the ovaries in women and testes in men.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Kallmann syndrome\n* Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* KAL1\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* More information about this gene can be found at the National Library of Medicine's [Genetics Home Reference](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/anos1).\n* The National Institutes of Health (NIH) provides more information on genetic disorders and their treatment.\n\n**References**\n\n* This information is based on MedlinePlus Genetics, a service provided by the US National Library of Medicine.\n\n---\n\n**ANOS1 Gene**\n\nThe ANOS1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called anosmin-1.

  "32fcba2632bb084c9d46d600965eee15": "**ANTXR2 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\nThe ANTXR2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found at the surface of many types of cells. The ANTXR2 protein is believed to interact with components of the extracellular matrix, which is the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell. This matrix strengthens and supports connective tissues, such as skin, bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments.\n\nThe ANTXR2 protein is involved in the formation of tiny blood vessels (capillaries). It may also be important for maintaining the structure of basement membranes, which are thin, sheet-like extracellular matrix structures that separate and support cells in many connective tissues. Research suggests that the ANTXR2 protein aids in the breakdown of at least one type of extracellular matrix protein, ensuring the correct balance of proteins is maintained for normal functioning of muscles and connective tissues.\n\nThe ANTXR2 protein also acts as a receptor for the toxin that causes anthrax, allowing the toxin to attach to cells and trigger disease.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nMore than 45 mutations in the ANTXR2 gene have been found to cause hyaline fibromatosis syndrome, a painful condition characterized by accumulation of a clear (hyaline) substance in different tissues in the body. The nature of the hyaline substance is unknown, but it likely contains extracellular matrix proteins, among other materials.\n\nBuildup of this material can cause firm lumps of noncancerous tissue (nodules) under the skin and in internal organs, joint deformities called contractures that restrict movement, and overgrowth of the gums. The severity of the signs and symptoms falls along a spectrum. The most severely affected individuals have severe diarrhea and recurrent infections and usually do not survive beyond early childhood. Individuals at the milder end of the spectrum typically survive into adulthood.\n\nSome ANTXR2 gene mutations reduce or eliminate the amount of ANTXR2 protein at the surface of cells. Others are thought to impair the protein's ability to interact with extracellular matrix components. It is unclear what effect these mutations have in cells and tissues. Researchers suspect that gene mutations disrupt the formation of basement membranes, allowing a hyaline substance to leak through and build up in various body tissues. Alternatively, the mutations could impair the breakdown of excess extracellular matrix proteins, which then accumulate in tissues and lead to the signs and symptoms of hyaline fibromatosis syndrome.\n\nIt is unclear why the severity of hyaline fibromatosis syndrome varies among affected individuals. Some studies have indicated that the severity of the condition may be linked to where in the gene the mutation occurs.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* ANTXR cell adhesion molecule 2\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* More information about this health condition can be found on MedlinePlus Genetics.\n\n---\n\n**Hyaline Fibromatosis Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\n\n**What is Hyaline Fibromatosis Syndrome?**\n\nHyaline fibromatosis syndrome is a rare and painful condition characterized by the accumulation of a clear (hyaline) substance in different tissues in the body. The nature of this substance is unknown, but it likely contains extracellular matrix proteins, among other materials.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Causes and Symptoms**\n\nThe buildup of this material can cause firm lumps of noncancerous tissue (nodules) under the skin and in internal organs, joint deformities called contractures that restrict movement, and overgrowth of the gums. The severity of the signs and symptoms falls along a spectrum.\n\n*   **Mild cases**: Individuals at the milder end of the spectrum typically survive into adulthood.\n*   **Severe cases**: The most severely affected individuals have severe diarrhea and recurrent infections and usually do not survive beyond early childhood.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Genetic Mutations**\n\nMore than 45 mutations in the ANTXR2 gene have been found to cause hyaline fibromatosis syndrome. Some of these mutations reduce or eliminate the amount of ANTXR2 protein at the surface of cells, while others impair the protein's ability to interact with extracellular matrix components.\n\n\\n\\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n*   Anthrax toxin receptor 2 (ANTXR2)\n*   Capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG-2)\n*   CMG2\n*   FLJ31074\n*   ISH\n*   JHF\n*   MGC111533\n*   MGC45856\n\n\\n\\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   **Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry**: Tests of ANTXR2 are available.\n*   **Scientific Articles on PubMed**: Search for articles related to hyaline fibromatosis syndrome and ANTXR2 gene mutations.\n*   **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**: Learn more about anthrax toxin receptor 2 (ANTXR2) and its association with hyaline fibromatosis syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**ANTXR2 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Description**\nThe ANTXR2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called anthrax toxin receptor 2, which plays a critical role in the regulation of extracellular collagen VI and is associated with hyaline fibromatosis syndrome.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   **Burgi J, Kunz B, Abrami L, Deuquet J, Piersigilli A, Scholl-Burgi S, Lausch E, Unger S, Superti-Furga A, Bonaldo P, van der Goot FG.** CMG2/ANTXR2 regulates extracellular collagen VI which accumulates in hyaline fibromatosis syndrome.

The APC protein acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it keeps cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way. It helps control how often a cell divides, how it attaches to other cells within a tissue, and whether a cell moves within or away from a tissue. This protein also helps ensure that the number of chromosomes in a cell is correct following cell division.\n\nThe APC protein accomplishes these tasks mainly through association with other proteins, especially those that are involved in cell attachment and signaling. One protein with which APC associates is beta-catenin. Beta-catenin helps control the activity (expression) of particular genes and promotes the growth and division (proliferation) of cells and the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation). Beta-catenin also helps cells attach to one another and is important for tissue formation.\n\nAssociation of APC with beta-catenin signals for beta-catenin to be broken down when it is no longer needed. This breakdown is essential for preventing uncontrolled cell growth and division, which can lead to cancer.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nSeveral mutations in the APC gene have been found in people with a type of aggressive but noncancerous (benign) growth called a desmoid tumor. These rare tumors arise from connective tissue, which provides strength and flexibility to structures such as bones, ligaments, and muscles.\n\n*   **Desmoid Tumor:**\n    *   APC gene mutations typically cause formation of desmoid tumors in the abdomen, but these tumors can also occur in other parts of the body.\n    *   Although APC-related desmoid tumors are commonly associated with a form of colon cancer called familial adenomatous polyposis (described below), APC gene mutations can cause tumors in individuals without this inherited disease.\n    *   APC gene mutations are found in about 10 to 15 percent of non-inherited (sporadic) desmoid tumors; these mutations are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in tumor cells.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n*   None listed\n\n---\n\n**APC Gene**\n\n**Diseases Associated with the APC Gene**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Familial Adenomatous Polyposis**\n  More than 700 mutations in the APC gene have been identified in families with the classic and attenuated types of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Most of these mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the APC protein. This short protein cannot suppress the cellular overgrowth that leads to the formation of abnormal growths (polyps) in the colon, which can become cancerous. The most common mutation in FAP is a deletion of five building blocks of DNA (nucleotides) in the APC gene.  This mutation changes the sequence of the building blocks of proteins (amino acids) in the resulting APC protein.\n\nAlthough most people with FAP will develop colorectal cancer, the number of polyps and the time frame in which they become cancerous depend on the location of the mutation in the APC gene. The location of the mutation also determines whether an individual with FAP is predisposed to developing desmoid tumors (described above).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Primary Macronodular Adrenal Hyperplasia**\n  MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Primary macronodular adrenal hyperplasia.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Other Cancers**\n  Mutations in the APC gene are also responsible for a disorder called Turcot syndrome, which is closely related to familial adenomatous polyposis. Turcot syndrome is an association of colorectal cancer with a type of cancerous brain tumor called a medulloblastoma. Approximately two-thirds of people with Turcot syndrome have mutations in the APC gene.\n\nA certain mutation in the APC gene (unrelated to Turcot syndrome) is found in approximately 6 percent of people with Ashkenazi (eastern and central European) Jewish heritage. This mutation replaces the amino acid isoleucine with the amino acid lysine at position 1307 in the APC protein (written as Ile1307Lys or I1307K). This change was initially thought to be harmless, but has been shown to be associated with a 10 percent to 20 percent increased risk of colon cancer.\n\nSomatic mutations in the APC gene may be involved in the development of a small percentage of stomach (gastric) cancers.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Desmoid Tumors**\n  Several mutations in the APC gene have been found in people with a type of aggressive but noncancerous (benign) growth called a desmoid tumor. These rare tumors arise from connective tissue, which provides strength and flexibility to structures such as bones, ligaments, and muscles.\n\nAPC gene mutations typically cause formation of desmoid tumors in the abdomen, but these tumors can also occur in other parts of the body. Although APC-related desmoid tumors are commonly associated with a form of colon cancer called familial adenomatous polyposis (described above), APC gene mutations can cause tumors in individuals without this inherited disease.\n\nAPC gene mutations are found in about 10 to 15 percent of non-inherited (sporadic) desmoid tumors; these mutations are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in tumor cells.\n\nMost APC gene mutations that cause sporadic desmoid tumors lead to an abnormally short APC protein. The shortened protein is unable to interact with the beta-catenin protein, which prevents the breakdown of beta-catenin when it is no longer needed. Excess beta-catenin promotes uncontrolled growth and division of cells, allowing the formation of desmoid tumors.\n\n---\n\n**APC Gene**\n\n**Category:** diseases\n\nThe APC gene is associated with the formation of abnormal growths (polyps) in the colon, which can become cancerous.

ApoA-I is a component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). HDL is a molecule that transports cholesterol and certain fats called phospholipids through the bloodstream from the body's tissues to the liver. Once in the liver, cholesterol and phospholipids are redistributed to other tissues or removed from the body.\n\n* ApoA-I attaches to cell membranes and promotes the movement of cholesterol and phospholipids from inside the cell to the outer surface.\n* Once outside the cell, these substances combine with apoA-I to form HDL.\n* ApoA-I also triggers a reaction called cholesterol esterification that converts cholesterol to a form that can be fully integrated into HDL and transported through the bloodstream.\n\nHDL is often referred to as \"good cholesterol\" because high levels of this substance reduce the chances of developing heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. The process of removing excess cholesterol from cells is extremely important for balancing cholesterol levels and maintaining cardiovascular health.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Familial HDL Deficiency**\n  Mutations in the APOA1 gene cause familial HDL deficiency, an inherited condition characterized by low levels of HDL in the blood and an elevated risk for early-onset cardiovascular disease, which often occurs before age 50.\n  These mutations lead to an altered apoA-I protein. Some versions of the altered protein are less able to promote the removal of cholesterol and phospholipids from cells, which decreases the amount of these substances available to form HDL.\n  Other versions of the altered protein are less able to stimulate cholesterol esterification, which means cholesterol cannot be integrated into HDL particles.\n  Both types of mutation result in low HDL levels. A shortage (deficiency) of HDL is believed to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* \n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* \n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n*\n\n---\n\n**APOA1 Gene**\n\n**Category:** diseases\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nMutations in the APOA1 gene can also cause a condition called familial visceral amyloidosis, which is characterized by an abnormal accumulation of proteins (amyloidosis) in internal organs (viscera). The mutations that cause this condition alter the apoA-I protein. Abnormal apoA-I proteins stick together to form amyloid deposits that impair the function of the affected organs. The liver, kidneys, and heart are commonly affected by amyloidosis. Depending on the organs involved, the signs and symptoms of the condition vary. Affected individuals can have an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), chronic kidney disease, or a form of heart disease called cardiomyopathy. However, in some people, the condition is very mild and causes no apparent signs or symptoms.\n\n**Familial HDL Deficiency**\n\nMutations in the APOA1 gene cause familial HDL deficiency, an inherited condition characterized by low levels of HDL in the blood and an elevated risk for early-onset cardiovascular disease, which often occurs before age 50.

As food is digested after a meal, chylomicrons are formed to carry fat and cholesterol from the intestine into the bloodstream. Chylomicrons are also necessary for the absorption of certain fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin E and vitamin A.\n\nApolipoprotein B-100, which is produced in the liver, is a component of several other types of lipoproteins.

These related molecules all transport fats and cholesterol in the bloodstream.\n\n**LDLs and Cholesterol**\n\nLDLs are the primary carriers of cholesterol in the blood. Apolipoprotein B-100 allows LDLs to attach to specific receptors on the surface of cells, particularly in the liver. Once attached, the receptors transport LDLs into the cell, where they are broken down to release cholesterol.

This condition is characterized by very high levels of cholesterol in the blood and an increased risk of developing heart disease.\n\n* Each mutation that causes this condition changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in a critical region of apolipoprotein B-100.\n* The altered protein prevents LDLs from effectively attaching to their receptors on the surface of cells, resulting in fewer LDLs being removed from the blood and higher than normal blood cholesterol levels.\n* As excess cholesterol circulates through the bloodstream, it is deposited abnormally in tissues such as the skin, tendons, and arteries that supply blood to the heart (coronary arteries).\n* A buildup of cholesterol in the walls of coronary arteries greatly increases a person's risk of having a heart attack.\n\nMost people with familial hypercholesterolemia inherit one altered copy of the APOB gene from an affected parent and one normal copy of the gene from the other parent. These cases are associated with an increased risk of early heart disease, typically beginning in a person's forties or fifties. Rarely, a person with familial hypercholesterolemia is born with two mutated copies of the APOB gene, resulting in a more severe form of hypercholesterolemia that usually appears in childhood.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Familial Hypobetalipoproteinemia**\n\nFamilial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL) is a disorder caused by more than 120 mutations in the APOB gene. This condition impairs the body's ability to absorb and transport fat.\n\n* Most APOB gene mutations that cause FHBL lead to the production of apolipoprotein B that is abnormally short.\n* The severity of the condition largely depends on the length of the abnormal apolipoprotein B.\n* Some mutations result in a protein that is shorter than both apolipoprotein B-48 and apolipoprotein B-100, leading to no normal-length apolipoprotein B protein being produced.\n* A decrease in fat transport reduces the body's ability to absorb fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the diet, leading to the signs and symptoms of FHBL.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes and Inheritance**\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means that a single copy of the altered gene is enough to cause the condition.\n\n* Most people with familial hypercholesterolemia inherit one altered copy of the APOB gene from an affected parent and one normal copy of the gene from the other parent.\n* Rarely, a person with familial hypercholesterolemia is born with two mutated copies of the APOB gene, resulting in a more severe form of hypercholesterolemia.\n\nFamilial hypobetalipoproteinemia is also inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.\n\n---\n\n**APOB Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**What is the APOB gene?**\n\nThe APOB gene provides instructions for making a protein called apolipoprotein B, which combines with fats (lipids) in the body to form lipoproteins. Lipoproteins are responsible for transporting cholesterol and other fats from one part of the body to another.\n\n**How do changes in the APOB gene affect the body?**\n\nChanges in the APOB gene can lead to a reduction in functional apolipoprotein B, which decreases the transportation of dietary fats and cholesterol. This reduction leads to a decrease in fat transport, making it difficult for the body to absorb fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the diet.\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\n* Researchers are studying other variations (polymorphisms) in the APOB gene that may influence heart disease risk in people without inherited cholesterol disorders.\n* Some studies have found that certain polymorphisms are associated with higher levels of LDLs in the blood and an increased chance of developing or dying of heart disease. Other studies, however, have not shown such an association.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* apoB-100\n* apoB-48\n* APOB_HUMAN\n* apolipoprotein B (including Ag(x) antigen)\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n  * Tests of APOB\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n  * PubMed\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n  * APOLIPOPROTEIN B; APOB\n* Gene and Variant Databases:\n  * NCBI Gene\n  * ClinVar\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n1.

This protein combines with fats (lipids) in the body to form molecules called lipoproteins. Lipoproteins are responsible for packaging cholesterol and other fats and carrying them through the bloodstream. Maintaining normal levels of cholesterol is essential for the prevention of disorders that affect the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular diseases), including heart attack and stroke.\n\nThere are at least three slightly different versions (alleles) of the APOE gene.

Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative disease of the brain that causes dementia, which is a gradual loss of memory, judgment, and ability to function.\n\n*   The late-onset form of the condition occurs in people older than age 65.\n*   People who inherit one copy of the APOE e4 allele have an increased chance of developing the disease; those who inherit two copies of the allele are at even greater risk.\n*   The APOE e4 allele may also be associated with an earlier onset of memory loss and other symptoms compared to individuals with Alzheimer's disease who do not have this allele.\n\nIt is not known how the APOE e4 allele is related to the risk of Alzheimer's disease.

This protein is found in many tissues and organs, including the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). Little is known about the function of amyloid precursor protein.\n\n* Researchers speculate that it may bind to other proteins on the surface of cells or help cells attach to one another.\n* Studies suggest that in the brain, it helps direct the movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons) during early development.\n\nAmyloid precursor protein is cut by enzymes to create smaller fragments (peptides), some of which are released outside the cell. Two of these fragments are called soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) and amyloid beta (β) peptide.\n\n* Recent evidence suggests that sAPP has growth-promoting properties and may play a role in the formation of neurons in the brain both before and after birth.\n* The sAPP peptide may also control the function of certain other proteins by turning off (inhibiting) their activity.\n* Amyloid β peptide is likely involved in the ability of neurons to change and adapt over time (plasticity).\n* Other functions of sAPP and amyloid β peptide are under investigation.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nMany variants (also called mutations) in the APP gene can cause early-onset Alzheimer's disease, which begins before age 65. These variants are responsible for less than 10 percent of all early-onset cases of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n* The most common APP gene variant changes one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) in the amyloid precursor protein.\n* This variant replaces the amino acid valine with the amino acid isoleucine at protein position 717 (written as Val717Ile or V717I).\n* Variants in the APP gene can lead to an increased amount of the amyloid β peptide or to the production of a slightly longer and stickier form of the peptide.\n* When these protein fragments are released from the cell, they can accumulate in the brain and form clumps called amyloid plaques. These plaques are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n**APP Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Hereditary Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy**\n\nVariants in the APP gene have been found to cause hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a condition characterized by stroke and a decline in intellectual function (dementia), which begins in mid-adulthood. These variants change single amino acids in the amyloid precursor protein. Each of these variants causes a different type of the condition.\n\n*   The Dutch type, the most common of all the types, is caused by the replacement of the amino acid glutamic acid with the amino acid glutamine at position 22 in the protein sequence (written as Glu22Gln or E22Q).\n*   The Italian type and Arctic type are also caused by changes to glutamic acid at position 22. In the Italian type, glutamic acid is replaced with the amino acid lysine (written as Glu22Lys or E22K) and in the Arctic type, glutamic acid is replaced with the amino acid glycine (written as Glu22Gly or E22G).\n*   The Flemish type is caused by replacement of the amino acid alanine with glycine at position 21 (written as Ala21Gly or A21G).\n*   In the Iowa type, the amino acid aspartic acid is switched with the amino acid asparagine at position 23 (written as Asp23Asn or D23N).\n*   The Piedmont type of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy is caused by the replacement of the amino acid leucine at position 34 with the amino acid valine (written as Leu34Val or L34V).\n\nThe result of all these variants is the production of an amyloid β peptide that is more prone to cluster together (aggregate) than the normal peptide. The aggregated protein forms amyloid deposits that accumulate in the blood vessels of the brain. The amyloid deposits replace the muscle fibers and elastic fibers that give blood vessels flexibility, causing the blood vessels to become weak and prone to breakage.\n\nIn the brain, such a break causes bleeding (hemorrhagic stroke), which can lead to brain damage and dementia or be life-threatening. Amyloid deposits in specific parts of the brain can interfere with normal brain function, leading to dementia, seizures, movement problems, and other neurological features in some people with hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy.\n\n**Alzheimer's Disease**\n\nMany variants (also called mutations) in the APP gene can cause early-onset Alzheimer's disease, which begins before age 65. These variants are responsible for less than 10 percent of all early-onset cases of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n*   The most common APP gene variant changes one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) in the amyloid precursor protein. This variant replaces the amino acid valine with the amino acid isoleucine at protein position 717 (written as Val717Ile or V717I).\n*   Variants in the APP gene can lead to an increased amount of the amyloid β peptide or to the production of a slightly longer and stickier form of the peptide. When these protein fragments are released from the cell, they can accumulate in the brain and form clumps called amyloid plaques.\n*   These plaques are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. A buildup of toxic amyloid β peptide and amyloid plaques may lead to the death of neurons and the progressive signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n---\n\n**Hereditary Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy**\n\n**What is Hereditary Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy?**\n\nHereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy (HCAA) is a condition characterized by stroke and a decline in intellectual function (dementia), which begins in mid-adulthood. This condition is caused by variants in the APP gene, which change single amino acids in the amyloid precursor protein.\n\n**Types of HCAA**\n\nThere are several types of HCAA, each caused by different variants in the APP gene:\n\n*   **Dutch type**: Caused by the replacement of glutamic acid with glutamine at position 22 (Glu22Gln or E22Q) in the protein sequence.\n*   **Italian type**: Caused by the replacement of glutamic acid with lysine at position 22 (Glu22Lys or E22K).\n*   **Arctic type**: Caused by the replacement of glutamic acid with glycine at position 22 (Glu22Gly or E22G).\n*   **Flemish type**: Caused by the replacement of alanine with glycine at position 21 (Ala21Gly or A21G).\n*   **Iowa type**: Caused by the replacement of aspartic acid with asparagine at position 23 (Asp23Asn or D23N).\n*   **Piedmont type**: Caused by the replacement of leucine with valine at position 34 (Leu34Val or L34V).\n\n**How Does HCAA Progress?**\n\nThe result of all these variants is the production of an amyloid β peptide that is more prone to cluster together (aggregate) than the normal peptide. The aggregated protein forms amyloid deposits that accumulate in the blood vessels of the brain, causing them to become weak and prone to breakage. In the brain, such a break can cause bleeding (hemorrhagic stroke), which can lead to brain damage and dementia or be life-threatening.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n*   A4_HUMAN\n*   AAA\n*   ABETA\n*   ABPP\n*   AD1\n*   Amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein\n*   Amyloid beta-peptide\n*   Amyloid beta-protein precursor\n*   Amyloid precursor protein\n*   APPI\n*   Cerebral vascular amyloid peptide\n*   CVAP\n*   PN-II\n*   PN2\n*   Protease nexin 2\n*   Protease nexin-II\n\n**References**\n\n1.

  "10fbcfb97aa031026629ea5b4cf2f3a2": "**APRT Gene**\n\nThe APRT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT). This enzyme is produced in all cells and is part of the purine salvage pathway, which recycles a group of DNA building blocks (nucleotides) called purines to make other molecules. The APRT enzyme helps to recycle the purine adenine to make a molecule called adenosine monophosphate (AMP). This conversion occurs when AMP is needed as a source of energy for cells.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nAdenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency is a condition that affects the kidneys and urinary tract. At least 40 mutations in the APRT gene have been found to cause this condition. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the APRT enzyme.\n\nThe mutations that cause adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency are categorized into two groups known as the APRT*J allele and the APRT*Q0 allele.\n\n* The APRT*J allele consists of one mutation that replaces the amino acid methionine with the amino acid threonine at position 136 in the APRT enzyme (written as Met136Thr or M136T). This mutation reduces the function of the enzyme. The M136T mutation occurs almost exclusively in Japanese individuals with the condition; most affected individuals have this mutation on both copies of the APRT gene in each cell.\n* The APRT*Q0 allele consists of all other APRT gene mutations. The most common of these mutations (written IVS4+2insT) alters the genetic instructions used to make the enzyme, resulting in an abnormally short, nonfunctional enzyme. This mutation is estimated to occur in 40 percent of affected Europeans.\n\nAPRT gene mutations lead to a lack of functional enzyme that prevents the conversion of adenine to AMP. As a result, adenine is converted to another molecule called 2,8-dihydroxyadenine (2,8-DHA). 2,8-DHA crystallizes in urine, forming stones in the kidneys and urinary tract. This can lead to kidney function decline, which may result in end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a life-threatening failure of kidney function.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* \n* \n\n**References**\n\n*\n\n---\n\n**APRT Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**What is the APRT gene?**\n\nThe APRT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT).

  "385f21ec9d5a2839c9faab70d7353bba": "**APTX Gene**\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe APTX gene provides instructions for making a protein called aprataxin that is involved in the repair of DNA damage in cells. Aprataxin is located in the nucleus of cells and is produced in various tissues, including the brain, spinal cord, and muscles. Different parts of the aprataxin protein allow the protein to interact with other DNA repair proteins to make repairs. At the site of the damage, aprataxin modifies the broken ends of the DNA strands so they can be joined back together correctly.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nAtaxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1 is a condition characterized by difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia) and problems with side-to-side movements of the eyes (oculomotor apraxia). More than 30 mutations in the APTX gene have been found to cause this condition. Most mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in aprataxin, resulting in an unstable aprataxin protein that is quickly broken down in the cell. A lack of functional aprataxin disrupts DNA repair and can lead to an accumulation of damage in cells, particularly affecting cells in the part of the brain involved in coordinating movements (the cerebellum). This accumulation can lead to cell death in the cerebellum, causing the characteristic movement problems of ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* AOA\n* AOA1\n* APTX_HUMAN\n* Ataxia 1, early onset with hypoalbuminemia\n* AXA1\n* EAOH\n* EOAHA\n* FHA-HIT\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n  * Tests of APTX\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n  * PubMed\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n  * APRATAXIN; APTX\n\n---\n\n**APTX Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Gene and Variant Databases**\n\n*   **NCBI Gene**\n*   **ClinVar**\n\n**Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry**\n\n*   **Tests of APTX**\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   **PubMed**\n\n**Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**\n\n*   **APRATAXIN; APTX**\n\n**Genomic Location**\n\nThe APTX gene is found on chromosome 9.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   **Genes and Gene Therapy**\n*   **Genetic Disorders**\n\n**Understanding Genetics**\n\n*   What is DNA?\n*   What is a gene?\n*   What is a gene variant and how do variants occur?\n\n**References**\n\n*   Ahel I, Rass U, El-Khamisy SF, Katyal S, Clements PM, McKinnon PJ, Caldecott KW, West SC.

  "6e97435dded95c913d740852d0dd515c": "**AQP2 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\nThe AQP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called aquaporin 2. This protein forms a channel that carries water molecules across cell membranes. It is found in the kidneys in structures called collecting ducts, which are a series of small tubes that reabsorb water from the kidneys into the bloodstream.\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe aquaporin 2 water channel plays an essential role in maintaining the body's water balance. The placement of these channels is controlled by a hormone called arginine vasopressin (AVP), which is sometimes also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH). When a person's fluid intake is low or when a lot of fluid is lost (for example, through sweating), AVP is released from the brain, where it is produced and stored. This hormone triggers chemical reactions that ultimately insert aquaporin 2 water channels into the membrane of collecting duct cells. These channels allow water to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream, which makes the urine more concentrated. When fluid intake is adequate, less AVP is released, and aquaporin 2 water channels are removed from the membrane of collecting duct cells. At these times, less water is reabsorbed into the bloodstream and the urine is more dilute.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Arginine Vasopressin Resistance**\n    Multiple variants (also called mutations) in the AQP2 gene have been identified in people with arginine vasopressin resistance. People with this condition produce an excessive amount of urine (polyuria), which depletes the amount of water in the body. This water loss also leads to excessive thirst (polydipsia).\n\n    Most of the AQP2 gene variants that cause this condition produce an aquaporin 2 protein that is folded incorrectly. The misfolded protein remains trapped within the cell, where it is unable to reach the cell membrane to transport water molecules. Some variants result in the production of functional aquaporin 2 water channels, but these channels are misrouted within the cell and do not reach the cell membrane.\n\n    If aquaporin 2 water channels are not inserted into the membrane of collecting duct cells, the kidneys are unable to respond to signals from AVP. As a result, collecting ducts do not reabsorb water as they should, leading to polyuria in people with arginine vasopressin resistance.\n\n---\n\n**AQP2 Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/3)**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**What is Arginine Vasopressin Resistance?**\n\nArginine vasopressin resistance, also known as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, is a condition where the kidneys are unable to respond to signals from arginine vasopressin (AVP), leading to excessive urine production and dehydration.\n\n**Causes of Arginine Vasopressin Resistance**\n\nMultiple variants in the AQP2 gene have been identified in people with arginine vasopressin resistance.

  "5429601ecf6afedf0c1620cec54107ca": "**AR Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe AR gene provides instructions for making a protein called an androgen receptor. Androgens are hormones (such as testosterone) that are important for normal male sexual development before birth and during puberty. Androgen receptors allow the body to respond appropriately to these hormones.\n\nThe receptors are present in many of the body's tissues, where they attach (bind) to androgens. The resulting androgen-receptor complex then binds to DNA and regulates the activity of certain genes that play a role in male sexual development. By turning the genes on or off as necessary, the androgen receptor complex helps direct the development of male sex characteristics. Androgens and androgen receptors also have other important functions in both males and females, such as regulating hair growth and sex drive.\n\nIn one region of the AR gene, a DNA segment known as CAG is repeated multiple times. This CAG segment is called a triplet or trinucleotide repeat. In most people, the number of CAG repeats in the AR gene ranges from fewer than 10 to about 36.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Androgen insensitivity syndrome\n  Hundreds of different variants (also called mutations) in the AR gene have been identified in people with androgen insensitivity syndrome, a condition that affects sexual development before birth and during puberty. Most of these variants are changes in single DNA building blocks (base pairs). Other variants insert or delete multiple base pairs in the gene. Some variants lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the androgen receptor protein, while others cause the production of an abnormal receptor that cannot bind to androgens or to DNA.\n  As a result of these changes, androgen receptors do not work properly, which makes them less able to bind to androgens and regulate gene activity. If androgen receptors cannot bind to androgens, the body cannot use androgens, even if there are normal levels of these hormones in the body.\n\nThere are three forms of androgen insensitivity syndrome: complete, partial, and mild. Which form a person has depends on how much the variants affect the function of the androgen receptor. Variants that produce nonfunctional versions of the androgen receptor cause complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, while variants that reduce but do not eliminate the receptor's activity can cause partial or mild androgen insensitivity syndrome.\n\nPeople with this condition have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each cell. Depending on the level of androgen insensitivity, affected individuals may have external sex characteristics that are typical for females or typical for males, or they may have features of both male and female sexual development.\n\n---\n\n**AR Gene**\n\nThe AR gene plays a crucial role in various conditions, including spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, androgenetic alopecia, polycystic ovary syndrome, prostate cancer, and androgen insensitivity syndrome.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy**\n\n*   Variants in the AR gene have been found to cause spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.\n*   This condition affects specialized nerve cells that control muscle movement (motor neurons).\n*   The AR gene variants that cause spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy are an expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the AR gene.\n*   Instead of the typical 10 to 36 repeats, CAG is repeated from 38 to more than 60 times in people with this disorder.\n*   Although the extended CAG region changes the structure of the androgen receptor, it is unclear how the altered protein damages nerve cells.\n*   Researchers believe that a fragment of the androgen receptor protein that contains the CAG repeats accumulates within these cells and interferes with normal cell functions.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Androgenetic Alopecia**\n\n*   Variants in the AR gene are associated with an increased risk of androgenetic alopecia, a form of hair loss also known as male pattern baldness in men and female pattern hair loss in women.\n*   The variants change the number or order of base pairs that make up the AR gene.\n*   These genetic changes appear to be most frequent in men with hair loss that begins at an early age.\n*   Researchers believe that AR gene variants may increase the activity of androgen receptors in the scalp.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Polycystic Ovary Syndrome**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about polycystic ovary syndrome.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prostate Cancer**\n\nMedlinePlus Genetics provides information about prostate cancer.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome**\n\n*   Hundreds of different variants (also called mutations) in the AR gene have been identified in people with androgen insensitivity syndrome, a condition that affects sexual development before birth and during puberty.\n*   Most of these variants are changes in single DNA building blocks (base pairs).\n*   Other variants insert or delete multiple base pairs in the gene.\n*   Some variants lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the androgen receptor protein, while others cause the production of an abnormal receptor that cannot bind to androgens or to DNA.\n*   As a result of these changes, androgen receptors do not work properly, which makes them less able to bind to androgens and regulate gene activity.\n*   If androgen receptors cannot bind to androgens, the body cannot use androgens, even if there are normal levels of these hormones in the body.\n*   There are three forms of androgen insensitivity syndrome: complete, partial, and mild.\n*   Which form a person has depends on how much the variants affect the function of the androgen receptor.\n*   Variants that produce nonfunctional versions of the androgen receptor cause complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, while variants that reduce but do not eliminate the receptor's activity can cause partial or mild androgen insensitivity syndrome.\n*   People with this condition have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each cell.\n*   Depending on the level of androgen insensitivity, affected individuals may have external sex characteristics that are typical for females or typical for males, or they may have features of both male and female sexual development.\n\n---\n\n**AR Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n**Category:** diseases\n\n**Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy**\n\n*Variants in the AR gene have been found to cause spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.*\n\nThis condition affects specialized nerve cells that control muscle movement (motor neurons). The AR gene variants that cause spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy are an expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the AR gene. Instead of the typical 10 to 36 repeats, CAG is repeated from 38 to more than 60 times in people with this disorder.\n\nAlthough the extended CAG region changes the structure of the androgen receptor, it is unclear how the altered protein damages nerve cells. Researchers believe that a fragment of the androgen receptor protein that contains the CAG repeats accumulates within these cells and interferes with normal cell functions. This buildup leads to the gradual loss of motor neurons, which results in muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Androgenetic Alopecia**\n\n*Variants in the AR gene are associated with an increased risk of androgenetic alopecia.*\n\nThis condition is a form of hair loss also known as male pattern baldness in men and female pattern hair loss in women. The variants change the number or order of base pairs that make up the AR gene. These genetic changes appear to be most frequent in men with hair loss that begins at an early age.\n\nResearchers believe that AR gene variants may increase the activity of androgen receptors in the scalp. Although androgenetic alopecia is related to the effects of androgens on hair growth, it remains unclear how changes in the AR gene increase the risk of hair loss in people with this condition.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Polycystic Ovary Syndrome**\n\n*MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Polycystic ovary syndrome.*\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prostate Cancer**\n\n*MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Prostate cancer.*\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n*AIS, ANDR_HUMAN, DHTR, NR3C4, TFM*\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry*\n*Scientific Articles on PubMed*\n*Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM (ANDROGEN RECEPTOR; AR)*\n\n---\n\n**AR Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Tests of AR**\n\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed\n    *   PubMed\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM\n    *   ANDROGEN RECEPTOR; AR\n*   Gene and Variant Databases\n    *   NCBI Gene\n    *   ClinVar\n    *   Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry\n        *   Tests of AR\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n1.

This enzyme participates in the urea cycle, a series of reactions that occurs in liver cells. The urea cycle processes excess nitrogen, which is generated when proteins and their building blocks (amino acids) are used by the body. The urea cycle produces a compound called urea from excess nitrogen. Urea is then excreted by the kidneys. Excreting the excess nitrogen prevents it from accumulating in the form of ammonia, which is toxic.\n\nArginase facilitates the last step of the urea cycle, a reaction in which nitrogen is removed from the amino acid arginine and processed into urea.

GAPs turn off (inactivate) proteins called GTPases, which play an important role in chemical signaling within cells. Often referred to as molecular switches, GTPases can be turned on and off. They are turned on (active) when they are attached (bound) to a molecule called GTP and are turned off when they are bound to another molecule called GDP. The ARHGAP31 protein inactivates GTPases known as Cdc42 and Rac1 by stimulating a reaction that turns the attached GTP into GDP. When active, Cdc42 and Rac1 transmit signals that are critical for various aspects of embryonic development. The ARHGAP31 protein appears to regulate these GTPases specifically during development of the limbs, skull, and heart.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   Adams-Oliver syndrome\n    *   At least three mutations in the ARHGAP31 gene are known to cause Adams-Oliver syndrome, a condition characterized by areas of missing skin (aplasia cutis congenita), usually on the scalp, and malformations of the hands and feet. These mutations lead to production of an abnormally short ARHGAP31 protein that is more active than normal. The increased GAP activity leads to a reduction in Cdc42 and Rac1 signaling, which impairs proper development of the skin on the top of the head and the bones in the hands and feet.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n*   AOS1\n*   Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein\n*   CDGAP\n*   RHG31_HUMAN\n*   rho GTPase-activating protein 31\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n    *   Tests of ARHGAP31 \n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n    *   PubMed \n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n    *   RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 31; ARHGAP31\n\n---\n\n**ARHGAP31 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Gene and Variant Databases**\n\n*   NCBI Gene\n*   ClinVar\n\n**Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry**\n\n*   Tests of ARHGAP31\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n*   Isrie M, Wuyts W, Van Esch H, Devriendt K.

SWI/SNF complexes regulate gene activity (expression) by a process known as chromatin remodeling. Chromatin is the network of DNA and protein that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. Chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated during development; when DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed.\n\nThrough their ability to regulate gene activity, SWI/SNF complexes are involved in many processes, including repairing damaged DNA; copying (replicating) DNA; and controlling the growth, division, and maturation (differentiation) of cells. The ARID1A protein and other SWI/SNF subunits are thought to act as tumor suppressors, which keep cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.\n\nThe ARID1A subunit is able to attach (bind) to DNA and is thought to help target SWI/SNF complexes to the chromatin location that needs to be remodeled.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Coffin-Siris Syndrome**\n  More than 30 variants (also known as mutations) in the ARID1A gene can cause Coffin-Siris syndrome. This condition is characterized by delayed development, abnormalities of the fifth (pinky) fingers or toes, and characteristic facial features that are described as coarse. The ARID1A gene variants involved in Coffin-Siris syndrome lead to an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein. As a result, affected individuals have half the normal amount of functioning ARID1A protein. Although it is unclear how these changes affect SWI/SNF complexes, researchers suggest that ARID1A gene variants result in abnormal chromatin remodeling. Disturbance of this process alters the activity of many genes and disrupts several cellular processes, which could explain the diverse signs and symptoms of Coffin-Siris syndrome. People with Coffin-Siris syndrome do not appear to have an increased risk of cancer (see below).\n\n* **Bladder Cancer**\n  MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Bladder cancer\n\n* **Cholangiocarcinoma**\n  MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Cholangiocarcinoma\n\n---\n\n**ARID1A Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Cancers**\n\nVariants in the ARID1A gene have been found in many types of cancer, including cancers of the ovaries and lining of the uterus (endometrium) in women and cancers of the kidney, stomach, bladder, lung, breast, and brain. These variants are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in tumor cells.\n\nThe mechanism by which variants in the ARID1A gene contribute to cancer is unknown, although it is thought that changes in SWI/SNF complexes are involved. These changes may impair normal cell differentiation, which leads to the overgrowth of certain cell types, causing cancer. Alternatively, abnormal SWI/SNF complexes may disrupt the regulation of genes that help control the growth and division of cells, which leads to cancer.\n\nIt is likely that other genetic changes in addition to ARID1A gene variants are necessary for cancer development.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Coffin-Siris Syndrome**\n\n* More than 30 variants (also known as mutations) in the ARID1A gene can cause Coffin-Siris syndrome.\n* This condition is characterized by:\n\t+ Delayed development\n\t+ Abnormalities of the fifth (pinky) fingers or toes\n\t+ Characteristic facial features that are described as coarse\n\nThe ARID1A gene variants involved in Coffin-Siris syndrome lead to an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein.

However, it is unclear what role, if any, the protein plays in early development or normal vision.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Age-related macular degeneration\n\nThe ARMS2 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 10 in a region known as 10q26. This region has been strongly associated with the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration, a common cause of vision loss in older adults. Researchers have identified several variations (polymorphisms) in and near the ARMS2 gene that may explain the association between the 10q26 region and age-related macular degeneration.\n\nThe best-studied of these variations, known as rs10490924, alters a single protein building block (amino acid) in the ARMS2 protein. Another common variation, a complex change that deletes a segment of the ARMS2 gene and inserts new genetic material, may also contribute to disease risk.\n\nIt is unclear how polymorphisms in the ARMS2 gene might be related to age-related macular degeneration. In the 10q26 region, the ARMS2 gene is located next to a gene called HTRA1; changes in this gene have also been studied as a risk factor for the disease. Because the two genes are so close together, it is difficult to tell whether changes in one gene or the other, or possibly changes in both genes, account for the increased disease risk.\n\nAge-related macular degeneration is a complex condition that likely results from a combination of multiple genetic and environmental factors.\n\n---\n\n**ARMS2 Gene**\n\n**Category:** diseases\n\n**What is ARMS2?**\nThe ARMS2 gene is associated with an increased risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

This enzyme is located in cellular structures called lysosomes, which are the cell's recycling centers. Within lysosomes, arylsulfatase A helps process substances known as sulfatides. Sulfatides are a subgroup of sphingolipids, a category of fats that are important components of cell membranes. Sulfatides are abundant in the nervous system's white matter, consisting of nerve fibers covered by myelin. Myelin, made up of multiple layers of membranes, insulates and protects nerves.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nMetachromatic leukodystrophy is a disorder that causes deterioration of nervous system functions. More than 110 mutations that cause this condition have been identified in the ARSA gene. These mutations greatly reduce the activity of arylsulfatase A, which interferes with the breakdown of sulfatides. As a result, these substances can accumulate to toxic levels in the nervous system.\n\nThe buildup of sulfatides gradually destroys the cells that produce myelin, leading to the loss of white matter (leukodystrophy) and impairment of nervous system function. This results in the signs and symptoms of metachromatic leukodystrophy.\n\nIn some cases, individuals with very low arylsulfatase A activity show no signs or symptoms of metachromatic leukodystrophy. This condition is called pseudoarylsulfatase deficiency and seems to be caused by specific variations of the ARSA gene. These variations are present in as many as 5 to 10 percent of Europeans and North Americans.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* \n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* \n\n**References**\n\n*\n\n---\n\n**ARSA Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\nThe ARSA gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called arylsulfatase A, which is involved in the breakdown of certain fatty substances (cerebrosides) found throughout the body.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n*   **ARSA_HUMAN**: cerebroside 3-sulfatase\n*   **Cerebroside-3-sulfate 3-sulfohydrolase**\n*   **Cerebroside-Sulfatase**\n*   **MLD sulfatidase**\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n    *   Tests of ARSA\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n    *   PubMed\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n    *   ARYLSULFATASE A; ARSA\n*   Gene and Variant Databases:\n    *   NCBI Gene\n    *   ClinVar\n\n**References**\n\n1.

On the basis of this action, the ARX protein is called a transcription factor. The ARX gene is part of a larger family of homeobox genes, which act during early embryonic development to control the formation of many body structures. Specifically, the ARX protein is believed to be involved in the development of the brain, pancreas, testes, and muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles).\n\nIn the pancreas, testes, and skeletal muscles, the ARX protein helps to regulate the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation). Within the developing brain, the ARX protein is involved with movement (migration) and communication of nerve cells (neurons). In particular, this protein regulates genes that play a role in the migration of specialized neurons (interneurons) to their proper location. Interneurons relay signals between other neurons.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   **Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy 1 (DEE1)**\n\n    Mutations in the ARX gene can cause DEE1, a disorder characterized by recurrent seizures called infantile spasms that begin in the first year of life. Children with this condition also have intellectual disability.\n\n    The normal ARX protein contains four regions where a protein building block (amino acid) called alanine is repeated multiple times. These stretches of alanines are known as polyalanine tracts. The most common ARX gene mutations that cause DEE1 add extra alanines to the first or second polyalanine tract in the ARX protein. This type of mutation is called a polyalanine repeat expansion. Research suggests that these polyalanine repeat expansions reduce the amount of ARX protein in cells, although the mechanism is unclear. Other ARX gene mutations that cause this condition are believed to reduce the function of the ARX protein. A shortage of ARX function is thought to impair the normal development and migration of certain interneurons, which likely underlies infantile spasms and other neurological problems characteristic of DEE1.\n\n*   **Partington Syndrome**\n\n    A few mutations in the ARX gene have been identified in people with Partington syndrome, a neurological disorder that causes intellectual disability and a group of movement problems called focal dystonia that primarily affects the hands. The most common mutation that causes Partington syndrome, a duplication of genetic material written as c.428_451dup, adds extra alanines to the second polyalanine tract in the ARX protein. The polyalanine repeat expansion likely reduces the amount of ARX protein or impairs its function and may disrupt normal interneuron migration in the developing brain, leading to the intellectual disability and dystonia characteristic of Partington syndrome.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n*   aristaless related homeobox\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   More information about this gene can be obtained from resources such as the National Library of Medicine.\n*   Additional information about genetic conditions caused by mutations in this gene can also be found on MedlinePlus.\n\n---\n\n**ARX Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics (Part 2/6)**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**X-linked Lissencephaly with Abnormal Genitalia**\n\nAt least 30 mutations in the ARX gene can cause X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia (XLAG). This condition is characterized by abnormal brain development that results in the brain having a smooth appearance (lissencephaly) instead of its normal folds and grooves. Males with XLAG also have abnormal genitalia.\n\nThe ARX gene mutations that cause XLAG lead to the production of a nonfunctional ARX protein or to a complete absence of ARX protein. As a result, the ARX protein cannot perform its role regulating the activity of genes important for interneuron migration. In addition to impairing normal brain development, a lack of functional ARX protein disrupts cell differentiation in the testes, leading to the development of abnormal genitalia.\n\nIt is thought that the disruption of ARX protein function in the pancreas plays a role in digestive issues, including chronic diarrhea, experienced by individuals with XLAG. Females with an ARX gene mutation typically have less severe signs and symptoms than males. Affected females may have an absence of the tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain (agenesis of the corpus callosum), some degree of intellectual disability, and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). Some females with an ARX gene mutation experience no symptoms.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nMutations in the ARX gene can cause a variety of conditions that impair brain function. Some ARX gene mutations result in intellectual disability without other neurological problems. Because the ARX gene is on the X chromosome, this condition is known as X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) or sometimes nonsyndromic XLID.\n\nARX gene mutations account for 9.5 percent of all cases of XLID. ARX gene mutations cause several XLID syndromes, including:\n\n*   X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia\n*   Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 1\n*   Partington syndrome (described above)\n*   X-linked myoclonic epilepsy with intellectual disability and spasticity, which causes intellectual disability and epilepsy\n*   Several syndromes that include structural brain malformations, such as Proud syndrome and hydranencephaly with abnormal genitalia\n\nFor unknown reasons, the same mutation can result in the development of different conditions in different people, even among individuals within the same family. It is not clear why mutations in the ARX gene cause this array of conditions; researchers suggest that other genetic and environmental factors that have not been identified are likely involved.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy 1**\n\nMutations in the ARX gene can cause developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 1 (DEE1), a disorder characterized by recurrent seizures called infantile spasms that begin in the first year of life.

This enzyme is found in lysosomes, which are cell compartments that digest and recycle materials. Within lysosomes, acid ceramidase breaks down fats (lipids) called ceramides.\n\n* Ceramides play a role in regulating:\n  * Cell maturation (differentiation)\n  * Growth and division of cells (proliferation)\n  * Controlled cell death (apoptosis)\n* Ceramides are also a component of myelin, which insulates and protects nerve cells.\n* They serve as building blocks for more complex lipids.\n\nWhen ceramides need to be replaced, they travel to lysosomes where acid ceramidase breaks them down into:\n\n* A fat called sphingosine\n* A fatty acid\n\nThese two breakdown products are recycled to create new ceramides for the body to use.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nVariants (also known as mutations) in the ASAH1 gene have been found to cause Farber lipogranulomatosis.

However, damage to the affected cells leads to the voice, skin, and joint problems that are characteristic of Farber lipogranulomatosis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* Not specified in this content\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Not specified in this content\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n* Not specified in this content\n\n---\n\n**ASAH1 Gene**\n\n**Diseases Associated with the ASAH1 Gene**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Spinal Muscular Atrophy with Progressive Myoclonic Epilepsy (SMA-PME)**\n  Variants in the ASAH1 gene have been found to cause spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (SMA-PME). This condition is characterized by muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) and a combination of seizures and uncontrollable muscle jerks (myoclonic epilepsy) that begin in childhood. The ASAH1 gene variants that cause SMA-PME result in a reduction of acid ceramidase activity to a level less than one-third of normal. The decrease in acid ceramidase activity leads to inefficient breakdown of ceramides and impaired production of its breakdown products sphingosine and fatty acids. The increase in ceramides and reduction in sphingosine and fatty acids likely play a role in the development of the features of SMA-PME, but the exact mechanism is unknown.\n\n  The reduction in acid ceramidase activity associated with SMA-PME is less than what occurs in another condition called Farber lipogranulomatosis (described below). Researchers suspect that the small amount of enzyme activity in SMA-PME allows some ceramide breakdown to occur, so the ceramides do not accumulate and damage cells as extensively as seen in Farber lipogranulomatosis. However, because SMA-PME is so rare, the effects of the enzyme changes are still unclear.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n* **Farber Lipogranulomatosis**\n  Variants (also known as mutations) in the ASAH1 gene have been found to cause Farber lipogranulomatosis.

It is unclear how an accumulation of ceramides impairs the normal functioning of cells, but damage to the affected cells leads to the voice, skin, and joint problems that are characteristic of Farber lipogranulomatosis.\n\n  Ceramides influence various cell functions, and it is likely that abnormal regulation of these processes also contributes to the features of this condition.\n\n---\n\n**ASAH1 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\nThe ASAH1 gene is associated with a rare condition called spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (SMA-PME).

Lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H functions as a histone methyltransferase. Histone methyltransferases are enzymes that modify proteins called histones. Histones are structural proteins that attach (bind) to DNA and give chromosomes their shape. By adding a molecule called a methyl group to histones (a process called methylation), histone methyltransferases control (regulate) the activity of certain genes. Lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H appears to turn on (activate) certain genes that are especially important for development of the brain.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Autism spectrum disorder\n  At least seven ASH1L gene mutations have been identified in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a varied condition characterized by impaired social skills, communication problems, and repetitive behaviors. Some ASH1L gene mutations associated with ASD change one building block (amino acid) in the lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H enzyme. Others delete genetic material in the ASH1L gene sequence or result in a premature stop signal that leads to an abnormally short enzyme. As a result of these mutations, the enzyme is nonfunctional. A lack of functional lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H enzyme disrupts histone methylation. The resulting changes in the expression of genes regulated by lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H affect brain development and increase the risk of ASD. Normal variations in other genes, as well as environmental risk factors, such as parental age, birth complications, and others that have not been identified, also affect an individual's risk of developing this complex condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* KMT2H\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* More information about the ASH1L gene can be found in medical literature.\n\n---\n\n**ASH1L Gene**\n\n**What is the ASH1L gene?**\n\nThe ASH1L gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H (KMT2H).

  "71b3d765d05cef71afe023df2dabb3d1": "**ASL Gene**\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe ASL gene provides instructions for making the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase. This enzyme primarily participates in the urea cycle, a series of reactions that occur in liver cells. The urea cycle processes excess nitrogen, generated when protein is used by the body, to make a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys. Excreting the excess nitrogen prevents it from accumulating in the form of ammonia.\n\nThe specific role of the argininosuccinate lyase enzyme is to start the reaction in which the amino acid arginine, a building block of proteins, is produced from argininosuccinate, the molecule that carries the waste nitrogen collected earlier in the urea cycle. The arginine is later broken down into urea, which is excreted, and ornithine, which restarts the urea cycle.\n\nIn cells throughout the body, the argininosuccinate lyase enzyme is also involved in moving (transporting) arginine into cells to make a compound called nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is important for regulating blood flow and blood pressure.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Argininosuccinic aciduria\n  More than 130 mutations in the ASL gene have been found to cause argininosuccinic aciduria. In some cases, a short sequence of DNA is deleted from the gene. Other mutations replace one protein building block (amino acid) with another amino acid in the argininosuccinate lyase enzyme. In people of Arab ancestry, two common mutations replace the amino acid glutamine with a premature stop signal at position 116 (written as Gln116Ter or Q116*) or position 354 (written as Gln354Ter or Q354*) in the argininosuccinate lyase enzyme. Mutations in the ASL gene may result in an argininosuccinate lyase enzyme that is unstable, misshapen, or quickly broken down.\n\nIf the argininosuccinate lyase enzyme is misshapen or missing, it cannot fulfill its role in the urea cycle. Arginine is not produced, excess nitrogen is not converted to urea for excretion, and ammonia accumulates in the body. This buildup of ammonia damages the brain and other tissues and causes neurological problems and other signs and symptoms of argininosuccinic aciduria.

This enzyme is found in cells throughout the body, where it converts the protein building block (amino acid) aspartic acid to the amino acid asparagine. Another amino acid called glutamine helps in the conversion and is itself converted to the amino acid glutamic acid during the process. It is thought that asparagine synthetase helps to maintain the normal balance of these four amino acids in the body.\n\n* Asparagine plays a crucial role in:\n  * Producing many proteins\n  * Breaking down toxic ammonia within cells\n  * Protein modification\n  * Making neurotransmitters\n\nAlthough asparagine can be obtained through the diet, the amino acid cannot cross the protective barrier that allows only certain substances to pass between blood vessels and the brain (the blood-brain barrier). As a result, brain cells rely solely on asparagine synthetase to produce asparagine.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nAsparagine synthetase deficiency is a severe condition caused by at least 15 mutations in the ASNS gene. These mutations replace single amino acids in the enzyme, resulting in little or no function. Asparagine from the diet likely makes up for the enzyme's inability to produce the amino acid in cells. However, because asparagine cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, brain cells in people with asparagine synthetase deficiency have a shortage (deficiency) of this amino acid.\n\n* Symptoms of asparagine synthetase deficiency include:\n  * Neurological problems soon after birth\n  * Poor brain development\n\nThe exact effect of asparagine synthetase deficiency on brain cells is unknown, but it is clear that asparagine is necessary for normal brain development. A lack of asparagine in developing brain cells leads to poor brain development and the severe neurological problems in individuals with asparagine synthetase deficiency.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* No other names are available for this gene.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* More information about this health condition is not available at this time.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n* References for this article are not provided.\n\n---\n\n**ASNS Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**What is ASNS gene?**\n\nThe ASNS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called asparagine synthetase, which plays a crucial role in the production of the amino acid asparagine.

  "7ff56e2e58dd230236017bc5ee1eaf18": "**ASPA Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\nThe ASPA gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aspartoacylase. In the brain, this enzyme breaks down a compound called N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid (NAA) into aspartic acid (an amino acid that is a building block of many proteins) and another molecule called acetic acid.\n\nThe production and breakdown of NAA appears to be critical for maintaining the brain's white matter, which consists of nerve fibers surrounded by a myelin sheath. The myelin sheath is the covering that protects nerve fibers and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. The precise function of NAA is unclear. Researchers had suspected that it played a role in the production of the myelin sheath, but recent studies suggest that NAA does not have this function. The enzyme may instead be involved in the transport of water molecules out of nerve cells (neurons).\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Canavan disease\n  + More than 80 mutations in the ASPA gene are known to cause Canavan disease, which is a rare inherited disorder that affects brain development.\n  + Researchers have described two major forms of this condition: neonatal/infantile Canavan disease, which is the most common and most severe form, and mild/juvenile Canavan disease.\n  + The ASPA gene mutations that cause the neonatal/infantile form severely impair the activity of aspartoacylase, preventing the breakdown of NAA and allowing this substance to build up to high levels in the brain.\n  + The mutations that cause the mild/juvenile form have milder effects on the enzyme's activity, leading to less accumulation of NAA.\n\nAn excess of NAA in the brain is associated with the signs and symptoms of Canavan disease. Studies suggest that if NAA is not broken down properly, the resulting chemical imbalance interferes with the formation of the myelin sheath as the nervous system develops. A buildup of NAA also leads to the progressive destruction of existing myelin sheaths. Nerves without this protective covering malfunction, which disrupts normal brain development.\n\nWhile Canavan disease occurs in people of all ethnic backgrounds, it is most common in people of Ashkenazi (eastern and central European) Jewish heritage. Two specific ASPA gene mutations cause almost all cases of the disease in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. One of these mutations replaces the amino acid glutamic acid with the amino acid alanine at position 285 of the enzyme (written as Glu285Ala or E285A). This genetic change greatly reduces the amount of functional aspartoacylase. The other mutation, which is written as Tyr231Ter or Y231X, prematurely stops protein production and leads to an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the enzyme.\n\nA different ASPA gene mutation is most common in people who are not of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. This mutation substitutes the amino acid glutamic acid for the amino acid alanine at position 305 of aspartoacylase (written as Ala305Glu or A305E). This mutation also leads to the production of a nonfunctional version of the enzyme.\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: References are not provided in the original content.

A series of additional chemical reactions uses argininosuccinic acid to form urea.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Citrullinemia**\n  At least 118 mutations that cause type I citrullinemia have been identified in the ASS1 gene. Type I citrullinemia is a serious condition that usually appears in the first few days of life. It causes life-threatening health problems, including poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and loss of consciousness.\n  \n  Most of the mutations involved in type I citrullinemia change single amino acids in the argininosuccinate synthase 1 enzyme. These genetic changes likely alter the structure of the enzyme, impairing its ability to attach to molecules such as citrulline and aspartate. A few mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the enzyme that cannot effectively play its role in the urea cycle.\n\n  Defects in argininosuccinate synthase 1 disrupt the third step of the urea cycle, preventing the liver from processing excess nitrogen into urea. As a result, nitrogen (in the form of ammonia) and other byproducts of the urea cycle (such as citrulline) build up in the bloodstream. Ammonia is toxic, particularly to the nervous system. An accumulation of ammonia during the first few days of life leads to poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and the other signs and symptoms of type I citrullinemia.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* No information available\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* No information available\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n* No information available\n\n---\n\n**ASS1 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**What is the ASS1 gene?**\nThe ASS1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1).

This test is commonly used to help diagnose liver damage or disease.\n\n**What is an AST test?**\n\nAn AST blood test measures the amount of AST in your blood. This test is commonly used to help diagnose liver damage or disease.\n\nAST (aspartate aminotransferase) is an enzyme, a protein that speeds up certain chemical reactions in your body. It is found mainly in your liver but also in your heart, muscles, and other tissues. Usually, you will have low levels of AST in your blood. When your liver or other cells that contain AST are damaged, they release AST into your blood. This can lead to high AST levels in your blood.\n\nAn AST test may be ordered by itself but is often ordered as part of a group of liver function tests.\n\nOther names: SGOT test, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase test; aspartate transaminase test\n\n**What is it used for?**\n\nAn AST blood test is often part of a routine blood screening to check the health of your liver. The test may help diagnose or monitor liver problems. It may also help diagnose other health conditions.\n\n**Why do I need an AST blood test?**\n\nYou may get an AST blood test as part of your routine checkup or to monitor the treatment of a liver problem. You may also need a test if you have symptoms of liver damage, which may include:\n\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Lack of appetite\n* Fatigue\n* Weakness\n* Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow\n* Swelling and/or pain in your abdomen (belly)\n* Swelling in your ankles and legs\n* Dark-colored urine (pee) and/or light-colored stool (poop)\n* Frequent itching\n\nEven if you don't have symptoms, your health care provider may order an AST blood test if you're more likely to develop liver disease because of:\n\n* A family history of liver disease\n* Alcohol use disorder (AUD)\n* Obesity\n* Diabetes\n* Taking certain medicines that can cause liver damage\n* Hepatitis or exposure to hepatitis\n\n**What happens during an AST blood test?**\n\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\n\n**Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?**\n\nYou may need to stop taking certain medicines before the test, so tell your provider about everything you take. But don't stop taking any medicines unless your provider tells you to.\n\nAn AST test is usually ordered with other blood tests. You usually need to fast (not eat or drink) for up to 12 hours before these tests. Your provider will let you know if there are any special instructions.\n\n**Are there any risks to the test?**\n\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\n\n**What do the results mean?**\n\nLow levels of AST in the blood are usually considered normal.\n\nHigh levels of AST in the blood may be due to liver disease or other liver problems. Other reasons you may have high levels of AST can include:\n\n* Hepatitis\n* Cirrhosis\n* Mononucleosis\n* Heart procedures or problems\n* Pancreatitis\n* Hemochromatosis (too much iron in the body)\n* Deep burns\n* Seizures\n* Use of drugs that are toxic to the liver, especially alcohol use\n\nIf your results are not in the normal range, it doesn't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Many things can affect your results, such as pregnancy, exercise, certain medicines, and your age or sex. Talk with your provider to learn what your results mean.\n\n**Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.**\n\nYour health care provider may order an ALT blood test along with your AST blood test. ALT stands for alanine transaminase, which is another type of liver enzyme. If you have high levels of AST and/or ALT, it may mean that you have some type of liver damage.\n\n---\n\n**AST Test**\n\n**What to Expect Before the Test**\n\nYou may need to stop taking certain medicines before the test, so tell your provider about everything you take.

Chromatin is the complex of DNA and proteins that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. When DNA is tightly packed, gene activity (expression) is lower than when DNA is loosely packed.\n\nThrough its role in chromatin remodeling, the ASXL1 protein regulates the expression of many genes, including a group of genes known as HOX genes, which play important roles in development before birth. The ASXL1 protein can turn on (activate) or turn off (repress) HOX genes depending on when they are needed.\n\nThe ASXL1 protein may have an additional role in gene regulation by signaling to molecules to add a methyl group (a process called methylation) to an area near a gene called the promoter region, which controls gene activity. When a promoter region is methylated, gene activity is repressed, and when a promoter region is not methylated, the gene is active.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Bohring-Opitz Syndrome**: More than 20 mutations in the ASXL1 gene have been found to cause Bohring-Opitz syndrome, a condition that causes abnormal head size and shape, distinctive facial features, joint abnormalities, intellectual disability, and other signs and symptoms.

These mutations are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in cells that give rise to cancer.\n\n* The mutations associated with these conditions are likely \"gain-of-function,\" which means that they lead to an overactive ASXL1 protein.\n* Researchers believe that the overactive ASXL1 protein leads to poor regulation of gene activity. It is unclear how this altered gene regulation plays a role in the development of cancer, but it is likely that overactive genes promote the growth of cancers by allowing abnormal blood cells to grow and divide uncontrollably.\n\nThe ASXL1 gene mutations involved in these cancers are different from the ones that cause Bohring-Opitz syndrome (described above).

This increased risk has been found primarily in people of northern European ancestry.\n  The identified ATG16L1 variation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in a critical region of the ATG16L1 protein. Specifically, it replaces the amino acid threonine with the amino acid alanine at protein position 300 (written as Thr300Ala or T300A).\n  This change in the ATG16L1 gene impairs the autophagy process, allowing worn-out cell parts and harmful bacteria to persist when they would otherwise be destroyed.

  "9cbc6b478f2ba13046b209f87a4d5fd8": "**ATL1 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe ATL1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called atlastin-1. Atlastin-1 is produced primarily in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), particularly in nerve cells (neurons) that extend down the spinal cord (corticospinal tracts). These neurons send electrical signals that lead to voluntary muscle movement.\n\nIn neurons, this protein is found mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is a structure involved in protein processing and distribution. Atlastin-1 fuses together the network of tubules that make up the structure of the endoplasmic reticulum. Atlastin-1 is also active in compartments called axonal growth cones, which are located at the tip of neurons.\n\nThe axonal growth cones direct the growth of specialized extensions, called axons, which transmit nerve impulses that signal muscle movement. Within axonal growth cones, atlastin-1 acts during development to help guide the growth of axons.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Spastic Paraplegia Type 3A\n  * Approximately 60 mutations in the ATL1 gene have been found to cause spastic paraplegia type 3A.\n  * This condition is characterized by muscle stiffness (spasticity) and weakness of the lower limbs (paraplegia), which begin in childhood.\n  * Most of the mutations that cause spastic paraplegia type 3A change one protein building block (amino acid) in the atlastin-1 protein.\n  * These mutations likely lead to abnormal activity of atlastin-1, which impairs the functioning of neurons, including the distribution of materials within these cells.\n  * This lack of functional atlastin-1 protein can also restrict the growth of axons. Within the long neurons of the corticospinal tracts, these problems can lead to cell death.\n  * As a result, the neurons are unable to transmit nerve impulses, particularly to other neurons and muscles in the lower extremities.\n  * This impaired nerve function leads to the signs and symptoms of spastic paraplegia type 3A.\n\n---\n\n**ATL1 Gene**\n\n**Category:** diseases\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nMutations in the ATL1 gene have been found to cause a condition called hereditary sensory neuropathy type ID. This condition is characterized by nerve abnormalities in the legs and feet (peripheral neuropathy). Many people with this condition experience prickling or tingling sensations (paresthesias), absent reflexes, weakness, and a reduced ability to feel pain. Affected individuals often get open sores (ulcers) on their feet, and because they cannot feel the pain of these sores, they may not seek immediate treatment. Without treatment, the ulcers can become infected and may require amputation of the surrounding area.\n\nAt least four ATL1 gene mutations have been found to cause hereditary sensory neuropathy type ID. These mutations impair nerve cell function and decrease transmission of nerve impulses, similar to the effects of ATL1 gene mutations that cause spastic paraplegia type 3A (described above). It is unclear why some ATL1 gene mutations cause hereditary sensory neuropathy type ID and others cause spastic paraplegia type 3A.\n\n**Spastic Paraplegia Type 3A**\n\nApproximately 60 mutations in the ATL1 gene have been found to cause spastic paraplegia type 3A. This condition is characterized by muscle stiffness (spasticity) and weakness of the lower limbs (paraplegia), which begin in childhood.\n\n* Most of the mutations that cause spastic paraplegia type 3A change one protein building block (amino acid) in the atlastin-1 protein.\n* These mutations likely lead to abnormal activity of atlastin-1, which impairs the functioning of neurons, including the distribution of materials within these cells.\n* This lack of functional atlastin-1 protein can also restrict the growth of axons. Within the long neurons of the corticospinal tracts, these problems can lead to cell death.\n* As a result, the neurons are unable to transmit nerve impulses, particularly to other neurons and muscles in the lower extremities. This impaired nerve function leads to the signs and symptoms of spastic paraplegia type 3A.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* AD-FSP\n* ATLA1_HUMAN\n* atlastin\n* atlastin1\n* FSP1\n* GBP3\n* guanylate-binding protein 3\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry: Tests of ATL1\n* Scientific Articles on PubMed: PubMed\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ ATLASTIN GTPase 1; ATL1\n\t+ NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE ID; HSN1D\n\n---\n\n**ATL1 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Genomic Location**\nThe ATL1 gene is found on chromosome 14.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Genes and Gene Therapy\n* Genetic Disorders\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**What is the ATL1 Gene?**\n\nThe ATL1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called atlastin-1.

This protein also plays an important role in the normal development and activity of several body systems, including the nervous system and the immune system. Additionally, the ATM protein assists cells in recognizing damaged or broken DNA strands.\n\nDNA can be damaged by agents such as toxic chemicals or radiation. Breaks in DNA strands also occur naturally when chromosomes exchange genetic material during cell division. The ATM protein coordinates DNA repair by activating enzymes that fix the broken strands. Efficient repair of damaged DNA strands helps maintain the stability of the cell's genetic information.\n\nBecause of its central role in cell division and DNA repair, the ATM protein is of great interest in cancer research.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Ataxia-telangiectasia\n  Researchers have identified several hundred variants (also called mutations) in the ATM gene that cause ataxia-telangiectasia. This disorder is characterized by progressive difficulty with coordinating movements (ataxia) beginning in early childhood.\n  People with this disorder have variants in both copies of the ATM gene in each cell. Most of these variants disrupt protein production, resulting in an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the ATM protein. Cells without any functional ATM protein are hypersensitive to radiation and do not respond normally to DNA damage.\n\n  Instead of activating DNA repair, the altered ATM protein allows variants to accumulate in other genes, which may cause cells to grow and divide in an uncontrolled way. This kind of unregulated cell growth can lead to the formation of cancerous tumors. In addition, ATM gene variants can allow cells to die inappropriately, particularly affecting cells in a part of the brain involved in coordinating movements (the cerebellum). This loss of brain cells causes the movement problems characteristic of ataxia-telangiectasia.\n\n* Bladder Cancer\n  MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Bladder cancer.\n* Breast Cancer\n  MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Breast cancer.\n* Melanoma\n  MedlinePlus Genetics provides information about Melanoma.\n\n---\n\n**ATM Gene**\n\n**Category:** diseases\n\n**Other Cancers**\n\nResearch suggests that people who carry one altered copy of the ATM gene in each cell may have an increased risk of developing several other types of cancer. In particular, some studies have shown that cancers of the breast, stomach, bladder, pancreas, lung, and ovaries occur more frequently in ATM gene variant carriers than in people who do not carry these variants. The results of similar studies, however, have been conflicting.

Although the exact function of this protein is unknown, it appears to play an important role in nerve cells (neurons) in many areas of the brain. Researchers speculate that atrophin 1 may act as a transcriptional co-repressor. A transcriptional co-repressor is a protein that interacts with other DNA-binding proteins to suppress the activity of certain genes, although it cannot attach (bind) to DNA by itself.\n\nOne region of the ATN1 gene contains a particular DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (cytosine, adenine, and guanine) that appear multiple times in a row. In most people, the number of CAG repeats in the ATN1 gene ranges from 6 to 35.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* **Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA)**: A progressive brain disorder that causes involuntary movements, mental and emotional problems, and a decline in thinking ability.

DRPLA results from an increased number of copies (expansion) of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the ATN1 gene. Specifically, the CAG segment is repeated at least 48 times, and the repeat region may be two or three times its usual length.\n\nThe extended CAG region changes the structure of atrophin 1 and how the protein interacts with other proteins to control gene function. This altered protein accumulates in neurons and interferes with normal cell functions.

This protein uses energy from a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to transport charged atoms (ions) into and out of cells. Specifically, the protein pumps sodium ions (Na+) out of cells and potassium ions (K+) into cells.\n\nNa+/K+ ATPases that include the alpha-1 subunit are found in many types of cells, although the pumps appear to play a particularly important role in the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney.

  "f838de56ac7fc92ed2cabe5e339233f8": "**ATP1A2 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe ATP1A2 gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha-2 subunit) of a protein known as a Na+/K+ ATPase. This protein uses energy from a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to transport charged atoms (ions) into and out of cells. Specifically, it pumps sodium ions (Na+) out of cells and potassium ions (K+) into cells.\n\nNa+/K+ ATPases that include the alpha-2 subunit are primarily found in nervous system cells called glia, which protect and maintain nerve cells (neurons). Through its action in glia, the protein plays a critical role in the normal function of neurons. Communication between neurons depends on chemicals called neurotransmitters. To relay signals, a neuron releases neurotransmitters, which attach to receptor proteins on neighboring neurons. After the neurotransmitters have had their effect, they detach from their receptors and are removed from the spaces between neurons by glia. This process is carefully regulated to ensure that signals are transmitted accurately throughout the nervous system. The Na+/K+ ATPase helps regulate this process by stimulating glia to clear neurotransmitters from the spaces between neurons. This protein also removes excess potassium ions from these spaces.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Alternating hemiplegia of childhood\n  * At least one mutation in the ATP1A2 gene can cause alternating hemiplegia of childhood.\n  * The primary feature of this condition is recurrent episodes of temporary paralysis, often affecting one side of the body (hemiplegia). During some episodes, the paralysis alternates from one side to the other or affects both sides of the body at the same time.\n  * The known ATP1A2 gene mutation associated with this condition replaces a single protein building block (amino acid) in Na+/K+ ATPase: the amino acid threonine is replaced with the amino acid asparagine at protein position 378 (written as Thr378Asn or T378N).\n  * This genetic change probably impairs the protein's ability to transport ions, although it is unclear how the mutation leads to the specific features of alternating hemiplegia of childhood.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* Not specified\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* Not specified\n\n**References**\n\n* Not specified\n\n---\n\n**ATP1A2 Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Familial Hemiplegic Migraine**\n\nMore than 30 mutations in the ATP1A2 gene have been identified in people with familial hemiplegic migraine type 2 (FHM2). This condition is characterized by migraine headaches with a pattern of neurological symptoms known as aura. In FHM2, the aura includes temporary numbness or weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis).\n\n* Most of the mutations involved in FHM2 change single amino acids in the Na+/K+ ATPase protein.\n* Some mutations impair the protein's ability to transport ions.\n* Others prevent the production of any protein from one copy of the ATP1A2 gene in each cell.\n\nAs a result, less potassium is pumped into neurons, less sodium is pumped out of these cells, and neurotransmitters spend more time in the spaces between neurons. The resulting changes in signaling in the brain lead people with FHM2 to develop these severe headaches.\n\n**Sporadic Hemiplegic Migraine**\n\nATP1A2 gene mutations can also cause sporadic hemiplegic migraine. The signs and symptoms of this condition are identical to those of FHM2; however, sporadic hemiplegic migraine occurs in people with no family history of the condition.\n\n* Most of the mutations associated with sporadic hemiplegic migraine change single amino acids in the Na+/K+ ATPase protein.\n* These changes impair the function of the protein.\n* Although the mutations that cause sporadic hemiplegic migraine are not as well-studied as those in familial hemiplegic migraine, it is thought that they have similar effects:\n  * Impairing the transport of sodium and potassium ions\n  * Prolonging the presence of neurotransmitters between neurons\n\n**Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood**\n\nAt least one mutation in the ATP1A2 gene can cause alternating hemiplegia of childhood. The primary feature of this condition is recurrent episodes of temporary paralysis, often affecting one side of the body (hemiplegia).

  "3c2118b2017f517a53ac94ec2ab772d1": "**ATP2A1 Gene**\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe ATP2A1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase 1 (SERCA1). This enzyme belongs to a family of ATPase enzymes that help control the level of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) inside cells. The SERCA1 enzyme is found in skeletal muscle cells. Skeletal muscles are the muscles used for movement.\n\nWithin muscle cells, the SERCA1 enzyme is located in the membrane of a structure called the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This structure plays a major role in muscle contraction and relaxation by storing and releasing calcium ions. When calcium ions are transported out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, muscles contract; when calcium ions are transported into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, muscles relax.

Manganese works with a variety of enzymes and is involved in processing newly formed proteins.\n\nThe hSPCA1 protein is present in cells throughout the body. It appears to be particularly important for the normal function of cells called keratinocytes, which are found in the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis).

This protein complex is known as a vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase). A V-ATPase acts as a pump to move positively charged hydrogen atoms (protons) across cell membranes.\n\n* V-ATPases are embedded in the membranes surrounding cells, where they transport protons into and out of cells.\n* This movement of protons helps regulate the relative acidity (pH) of cells and their surrounding environment. Tight control of pH is necessary for most biological reactions to proceed properly.\n* Within cells, V-ATPases help regulate the pH of particular cell compartments. These compartments include endosomes and lysosomes, which digest and recycle materials that the cell no longer needs.\n* Studies suggest that V-ATPases are also involved in the movement (trafficking) of small sac-like structures called vesicles. Vesicles transport many types of molecules within cells.\n* V-ATPases also play a key role in a complex process called glycosylation, in which proteins are modified by adding sugar molecules. Glycosylation is necessary for the normal function of many different kinds of proteins. V-ATPases regulate the pH of a cellular structure called the Golgi apparatus, where glycosylation occurs.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nCutis laxa is a condition related to genetic changes in the ATP6V0A2 gene. More than 40 variants (also known as mutations) in this gene have been identified in people with cutis laxa. These variants cause a form of the disorder called autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 2A (ARCL2A), which is characterized by:\n\n* Loose, sagging skin\n* Distinctive facial features\n* Larger than normal spaces (fontanelles) between the skull bones that close later than usual\n* Some affected individuals may also have:\n\t+ Delayed development\n\t+ Intellectual disability\n\t+ Seizures\n\t+ Problems with movement that can worsen over time\n\n---\n\n**ATP6V0A2 Gene**\n\n**Category:** diseases\n\nVariants in this gene also cause a related condition called wrinkly skin syndrome, which typically has milder features. Variants in the ATP6V0A2 gene prevent the cell from producing a functional a2 subunit, which disrupts the normal function of V-ATPases. It is unclear how these genetic changes cause the signs and symptoms of cutis laxa.\n\n**Cutis Laxa**\n\n*   More than 40 variants (also known as mutations) in the ATP6V0A2 gene have been identified in people with cutis laxa.\n*   ATP6V0A2 variants cause a form of the disorder called autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 2A (ARCL2A), which is characterized by:\n    *   Loose, sagging skin\n    *   Distinctive facial features\n    *   Larger than normal spaces (fontanelles) between the skull bones that close later than usual\n*   Some affected individuals also have delayed development, intellectual disability, seizures, or problems with movement that can worsen over time.\n\n**Causes of Cutis Laxa**\n\n*   Variants in the ATP6V0A2 gene prevent the cell from producing a functional a2 subunit.\n*   This disrupts the normal function of V-ATPases.\n*   Researchers suspect that changes in V-ATPase function may disrupt the normal glycosylation of proteins, including several that are involved in the assembly and maintenance of elastic fibers.\n\n**Elastic Fibers**\n\n*   Elastic fibers are slender bundles of proteins that provide strength and flexibility to connective tissue (tissue that supports the body's joints and organs).\n*   People with cutis laxa have a reduced density of elastic fibers, which weakens connective tissue in the skin, lungs, and other organs.\n\n**Classification**\n\n*   Because problems with glycosylation underlie ARCL2A, the condition is classified as a congenital disorder of glycosylation.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n*   A2V-ATPase\n*   ATP6a2\n*   ATP6N1D\n*   ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal V0 subunit a2\n*   J6B7\n*   Stv1\n*   TJ6\n*   TJ6M\n*   TJ6s\n*   Vph1\n*   VPP2_HUMAN\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   Tests Listed in the Genetic Testing Registry:\n    *   Tests of ATP6V0A2\n*   Scientific Articles on PubMed:\n    *   PubMed\n*   Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n    *   ATPase, H+ TRANSPORTING, LYSOSOMAL, V0 SUBUNIT A2; ATP6V0A2\n\n---\n\n**ATP6V0A2 Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n* Guillard M, Dimopoulou A, Fischer B, Morava E, Lefeber DJ, Kornak U, Wevers RA.

V-ATPases are a group of similar complexes that act as pumps to move positively charged hydrogen atoms (protons) across membranes.

Tight control of pH is necessary for most biological reactions to proceed properly.\n\nThe V-ATPase that includes the subunit produced from the ATP6V0A4 gene is found in the inner ear and in nephrons, which are the functional structures within the kidneys. The kidneys filter waste products from the blood and remove them in urine. They also reabsorb needed nutrients and release them back into the blood. Each nephron consists of two parts: a renal corpuscle (also known as a glomerulus) that filters the blood, and a renal tubule that reabsorbs substances that are needed and eliminates unneeded substances in urine. The V-ATPase is involved in regulating the amount of acid that is removed from the blood into the urine, and also in maintaining the proper pH of the fluid in the inner ear (endolymph).\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   Renal tubular acidosis with deafness\n    *   Several ATP6V0A4 gene mutations have been identified in people with renal tubular acidosis with deafness, a disorder involving excess acid in the blood (metabolic acidosis), bone weakness, and hearing loss caused by changes in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss).\n    *   Mutations in the ATP6V0A4 gene impair the function of the V-ATPase proton pump.

V-ATPases are a group of similar complexes that act as pumps to move positively charged hydrogen atoms (protons) across membranes. Because acids are substances that can \"donate\" protons to other molecules, this movement of protons helps regulate the relative acidity (pH) of cells and their surrounding environment. Tight control of pH is necessary for most biological reactions to proceed properly.\n\nThe V-ATPase that includes the subunit produced from the ATP6V1B1 gene is found in the inner ear and in nephrons, which are the functional structures within the kidneys. The kidneys filter waste products from the blood and remove them in urine. They also reabsorb needed nutrients and release them back into the blood. Each nephron consists of two parts: a renal corpuscle (also known as a glomerulus) that filters the blood, and a renal tubule that reabsorbs substances that are needed and eliminates unneeded substances in urine. The V-ATPase is involved in regulating the amount of acid that is removed from the blood into the urine, and also in maintaining the proper pH of the fluid in the inner ear (endolymph).\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Renal tubular acidosis with deafness\n  More than 25 ATP6V1B1 gene mutations have been identified in people with renal tubular acidosis with deafness, a disorder involving excess acid in the blood (metabolic acidosis), bone weakness, and hearing loss caused by changes in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss).

Copper is necessary for many cellular functions, but it is toxic when present in excessive amounts. The ATP7A protein is found throughout the body, except in liver cells. In the small intestine, this protein helps control the absorption of copper from food. In other cells, the ATP7A protein has a dual role and shuttles between two cellular locations.\n\nThe protein normally resides in a cell structure called the Golgi apparatus, which modifies newly produced proteins, including enzymes. In the Golgi apparatus, the ATP7A protein supplies copper to certain enzymes that are critical for the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels, and the nervous system.

  "65250a088d88d98d1e2da838bc6f47c1": "**ATP7B Gene**\n\nThe ATP7B gene provides instructions for making a protein called copper-transporting ATPase 2. This protein is part of the P-type ATPase family, a group of proteins that transport metals into and out of cells by using energy stored in the molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP).\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe ATP7B gene plays a crucial role in the transport of copper from the liver to other parts of the body. Copper is an essential part of certain enzymes that maintain normal cell functions, and copper-transporting ATPase 2 is also important for removing excess copper from the body.\n\nWithin liver cells, copper-transporting ATPase 2 is found in a structure called the Golgi apparatus, which modifies newly produced enzymes and other proteins. Here, copper-transporting ATPase 2 supplies copper to a protein called ceruloplasmin, which transports copper to other parts of the body via the blood.\n\nIf copper levels in the liver get too high, copper-transporting ATPase 2 leaves the Golgi and transfers copper to small sacs (vesicles) for elimination through bile. Bile is a substance produced by the liver that is important for digestion and the removal of waste products.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nWilson disease is a condition caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. Researchers have identified more than 250 ATP7B gene mutations that cause Wilson disease. About half the mutations change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make copper-transporting ATPase 2.\n\n* Common amino acid substitutions:\n\t+ His1069Gln or H1069Q: This particular mutation occurs in nearly 40 percent of affected individuals with a Northern or Eastern European ancestry.\n\t+ Arg778Leu or R778L: Approximately one-third of Asians with Wilson disease have this mutation.\n\n---\n\n**ATP7B Gene**\n\n**Category:** diseases\n\nThe **ATP7B gene** plays a crucial role in the removal of excess copper from the body. Mutations in this gene can lead to Wilson disease, a condition characterized by an accumulation of toxic levels of copper in tissues and organs.\n\n**Causes of Wilson Disease**\n\nResearchers have identified more than 250 ATP7B gene mutations that cause Wilson disease. These mutations can be categorized into two main types:\n\n*   **Amino acid substitutions**: About half the mutations change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make copper-transporting ATPase 2. This type of mutation alters the 3-dimensional structure of the protein or its stability, preventing copper-transporting ATPase 2 from functioning properly.\n*   **Deletions and insertions**: Other types of mutations delete or insert small segments of DNA within the ATP7B gene or introduce a stop signal in the gene's instructions for making copper-transporting ATPase 2. As a result, no protein is produced, or an abnormally small protein is made.\n\n**Common Mutations**\n\nSome common mutations associated with Wilson disease include:\n\n*   **His1069Gln (H1069Q)**: This mutation occurs in nearly 40 percent of affected individuals with a Northern or Eastern European ancestry.\n*   **Arg778Leu (R778L)**: Approximately one-third of Asians with Wilson disease have this mutation.\n*   **Asp1270Ser (D1270S)**: In the Costa Rican population, more than 60 percent of affected individuals have this mutation.\n\n**Symptoms and Complications**\n\nWith a shortage of functional protein, removal of excess copper from the body is impaired. As a result, copper accumulates to toxic levels that can damage tissues and organs, particularly the liver and brain.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\nThe ATP7B gene has several other names, including:\n\n*   **ATPase, Cu++ transporting, beta polypeptide**\n*   **Copper pump 2**\n*   **PWD (Wilson disease-associated protein)**\n*   **WND (Wilson disease)**\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on the ATP7B gene and Wilson disease, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n*   **Genetic Testing Registry**: This registry lists tests for the ATP7B gene.\n*   **PubMed**: This database contains scientific articles related to the ATP7B gene and Wilson disease.\n*   **Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM**: This catalog provides information on the ATP7B gene and its associated diseases.\n\n---\n\n**ATP7B Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Genomic Location**\nThe ATP7B gene is found on chromosome 13.\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n* Genes and Gene Therapy\n* Genetic Disorders\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Scientific Articles on PubMed**\n\n* Cater MA, Forbes J, La Fontaine S, Cox D, Mercer JF.

  "1f20a9f8f5b73104cb5471104c1cb2c3": "**ATRX Gene**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe ATRX gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an essential role in normal development. Although the specific function of the ATRX protein is unknown, studies suggest that it helps regulate the activity (expression) of other genes through a process known as chromatin remodeling. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and protein that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. Chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated during development. When DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed.\n\nThe ATRX protein appears to regulate the expression of two genes, HBA1 and HBA2, that are necessary for the production of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body. Other genes regulated by the ATRX protein have not been identified.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nAlpha thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome\n\nMore than 125 mutations in the ATRX gene have been identified in people with alpha thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome. The most common mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ATRX protein. Other mutations insert or delete genetic material in the ATRX gene or alter how the gene's instructions are used to make the protein.\n\nMutations may destabilize the ATRX protein or affect its interactions with other proteins. These changes prevent the ATRX protein from effectively regulating gene expression. Reduced activity of the HBA1 and HBA2 genes causes a blood disorder called alpha thalassemia. Abnormal expression of additional genes likely causes developmental delay, distinctive facial features, and the other signs and symptoms of alpha thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome.\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n*   (expand section)\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n*   (expand section)\n\n**References**\n\n*   (expand section)\n\n---\n\n**Alpha Thalassemia X-linked Intellectual Disability Syndrome**\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Disorders**\n\nSome gene mutations are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. These changes, which are not inherited, are called somatic mutations.\n\n* Somatic mutations of the ATRX gene have been found in some people with blood and bone marrow disorders.\n* In particular, researchers have found somatic ATRX gene mutations in some cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a bone marrow disorder that usually occurs in older males.\n* Somatic ATRX gene mutations do not cause MDS; instead, they occur as the condition progresses.\n* Like inherited mutations in the ATRX gene, somatic mutations reduce the activity of the HBA1 and HBA2 genes and cause alpha thalassemia.\n* When alpha thalassemia occurs in people with MDS, the combination of disorders is often referred to as alpha thalassemia myelodysplastic syndrome (ATMDS).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Alpha Thalassemia X-linked Intellectual Disability Syndrome**\n\nMore than 125 mutations in the ATRX gene have been identified in people with alpha thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome.\n\n* The most common mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ATRX protein.\n* Other mutations insert or delete genetic material in the ATRX gene or alter how the gene's instructions are used to make the protein.\n* Mutations may destabilize the ATRX protein or affect its interactions with other proteins.

Ataxin-3 is involved in a mechanism called the ubiquitin-proteasome system that destroys and gets rid of excess or damaged proteins.\n\n* The molecule ubiquitin attaches (binds) to unneeded proteins and tags them to be broken down (degraded) within cells.\n* Ataxin-3 removes (cleaves) the ubiquitin from these unwanted proteins just before they are degraded so that the ubiquitin can be used again. Due to its role in cleaving ubiquitin from proteins, ataxin-3 is known as a deubiquitinating enzyme.\n\nResearchers believe that ataxin-3 also may be involved in regulating the first stage of protein production (transcription).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nSpinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement. SCA3 results from a mutation in the ATXN3 gene known as a trinucleotide repeat expansion.\n\n* This mutation increases the length of the repeated CAG segment in the ATXN3 gene.\n* People with SCA3 have more than 50 CAG repeats.\n\nThe expanded CAG segment leads to the production of an abnormally long version of the ataxin-3 protein that folds into the wrong 3-dimensional shape. This nonfunctional ataxin-3 protein cannot remove ubiquitin from proteins that are no longer needed. As a result, these unwanted proteins, along with ubiquitin and ataxin-3, cluster together to form clumps (aggregates) within the nucleus of the cells.\n\n* Nerve cells (neurons) and other types of brain cells are most affected by mutations in the ATXN3 gene.\n* SCA3 is associated with cell death in the part of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord (the brainstem), the part of the brain involved in coordinating movements (the cerebellum), and other areas of the brain.\n* This condition is also associated with the death of neurons in the spinal cord.\n\nOver time, the loss of cells in the brain and spinal cord cells cause the signs and symptoms characteristic of SCA3.\n\n---\n\n**ATXN3 Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n**What is the ATXN3 gene?**\n\nThe ATXN3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ataxin-3, which is involved in removing ubiquitin from proteins that are no longer needed.

This protein regulates certain events during cell division. Cell division occurs when a cell replicates and splits its contents, separating into two new cells. Aurora kinase C helps the two dividing cells separate from each other and ensures that these cells each contain a complete set of chromosomes. Aurora kinase C is most abundant in male testes, which are the male reproductive organs in which sperm are produced and stored. In the testes, this protein regulates the division of sperm cells, ensuring that every new sperm cell divides properly and contains one copy of each chromosome.\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\nMacrozoospermia is a condition caused by mutations in the AURKC gene.

  "3f1a5106bedd0d708fce9ded3034cc59": "**AVP Gene**\n\n**Normal Function**\n\nThe AVP gene provides instructions for making a hormone called arginine vasopressin (AVP), which is sometimes also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH). AVP starts out as a larger molecule called a preprohormone that is cut (cleaved) and modified to produce the active hormone and several related proteins. The preprohormone is made in a region of the brain called the hypothalamus. It is then transported to the nearby pituitary gland, where active AVP is stored until it is needed.\n\nThe major function of AVP is to help control the body's water balance by determining how much water is released in urine. Normally, when a person's fluid intake is low or when a lot of fluid is lost (for example, through sweating), the pituitary gland releases more AVP into the bloodstream. High levels of this hormone direct the kidneys to reabsorb more water and make less urine. When fluid intake is adequate, the pituitary gland releases less AVP.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n* Arginine vasopressin deficiency\n  Many variants (also called mutations) in the AVP gene have been found to cause arginine vasopressin deficiency. People with this condition produce an excessive amount of urine (polyuria), which depletes the amount of water in the body. This water loss also leads to excessive thirst (polydipsia). Some of the AVP gene variants that cause arginine vasopressin deficiency change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the preprohormone. Other variants cause the cell to produce an abnormally short version of this molecule. The altered preprohormone becomes trapped inside the cells where it is produced instead of being transported to the pituitary gland. The resulting shortage of AVP prevents the kidneys from reabsorbing water, and the body makes excessive amounts of urine. These problems with water balance are characteristic of arginine vasopressin deficiency.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Other Names for This Gene**\n\n* No information available\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\n* No information available\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\n* No information available\n\n---\n\n**AVP Gene: MedlinePlus Genetics**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\nThe AVP gene provides instructions for making a molecule called arginine vasopressin (AVP), which plays a crucial role in regulating the balance of water in the body.

This receptor works together with a hormone called arginine vasopressin (AVP), which is sometimes also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The vasopressin V2 receptor is found in the kidneys in structures called collecting ducts, which are a series of small tubes that reabsorb water from the kidneys into the bloodstream.\n\nThe interaction between AVP and the vasopressin V2 receptor triggers chemical reactions that control the body's water balance. When a person's fluid intake is low or when a lot of fluid is lost (for example, through sweating), AVP is released from the brain, where it is produced and stored. In the kidneys, this hormone attaches (binds) to the vasopressin V2 receptor and directs the kidneys to concentrate urine by reabsorbing some of the water back into the bloodstream. When fluid intake is adequate, the brain releases less AVP. At these times, less water is reabsorbed into the bloodstream and the urine is more dilute.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Health Conditions Related to Genetic Changes**\n\n*   Arginine Vasopressin Resistance\n    Hundreds of variants (also called mutations) in the AVPR2 gene have been identified in people with arginine vasopressin resistance. People with this condition produce an excessive amount of urine (polyuria), which depletes the amount of water in the body. This water loss also leads to excessive thirst (polydipsia). Most of the variants that cause this condition produce a vasopressin V2 receptor protein that is folded incorrectly. The misfolded protein remains trapped within the cell, where it is unable to reach the cell surface to interact with AVP. Less common variants in the AVPR2 gene prevent the production of any vasopressin V2 receptor protein or lead to a version of the protein that can reach the cell surface but cannot bind to AVP.\n\nWithout functional vasopressin V2 receptors, the kidneys are unable to respond to signals from AVP.

This condition is characterized by low levels of salt in the blood (hyponatremia), which can lead to brain swelling and other serious complications. NSIAD also causes the blood to be abnormally dilute (serum hypo-osmolality).\n\nThe AVPR2 gene variants associated with NSIAD change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the vasopressin V2 receptor protein. These variants lead to a receptor protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated), even in the absence of AVP. As a result, water is reabsorbed into the bloodstream regardless of fluid intake, and urine is highly concentrated. These abnormalities disrupt the body's water balance, causing hyponatremia and serum hypo-osmolality.\n\n**Arginine Vasopressin Resistance**\n\n* Hundreds of variants (also called mutations) in the AVPR2 gene have been identified in people with arginine vasopressin resistance.\n* People with this condition produce an excessive amount of urine (polyuria), which depletes the amount of water in the body.

These variants disrupt Cdc42 signaling, leading to the wide variety of abnormalities that occur in people with Aarskog-Scott syndrome.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Frequency**\n\n* Aarskog-Scott syndrome is believed to be a rare disorder.\n* Its prevalence is unknown because mildly affected people may not be diagnosed.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Inheritance**\n\n* When caused by FGD1 gene variants, Aarskog-Scott syndrome is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern.\n* The FGD1 gene is located on the X chromosome.

Abacavir and lamivudine are in a class of medications called nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and dolutegravir is in a class of medications called integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs).\n\nThey work by decreasing the amount of HIV in your blood and increasing the number of immune cells that help fight infections in your body. Although abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine will not cure HIV, these medications may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer.\n\nTaking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of getting or transmitting the HIV virus to other people.\n\n---\n\n**Abacavir, Dolutegravir, and Lamivudine: MedlinePlus Drug Information**\n\n**How to Use This Medicine**\n\nThese medications along with practicing safer sex and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of getting or transmitting the HIV virus to other people.\n\n*   The combination of abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine comes as a tablet to take by mouth or tablets to be dissolved into a suspension (liquid) to be taken by mouth.\n*   The tablet is usually prescribed for adults and children weighing more than 55 lb (25 kg) and taken once daily with or without food.\n*   The tablets for suspension are prescribed for children weighing less than 55 lb (25 kg) and are taken once daily with or without food.\n*   Take abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine at around the same time every day.\n*   Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n*   Take abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\n**Preparing the Suspension for Children**\n\nIf giving the tablets for suspension to a child:\n\n1.  Place the tablets in the provided cup with 15-20 mL of drinking water (3 tablets can be placed in 15 mL, but more than 3 tablets should be placed in 20 mL).\n2.  Swirl contents until tablets are completely dissolved and no lumps remain.\n3.  After tablets are completely dissolved, the contents of the cup should be completely swallowed within 30 minutes.\n4.  For children too young to drink from a cup, the contents of the cup may be drawn into a syringe and the medication given this way.\n\n**Important Information**\n\nAbacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine help to control HIV infection but do not cure it. Continue to take abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine even if you feel well.

It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood.\n\nAlthough abacavir does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people.\n\n**How Should This Medicine Be Used?**\n\nAbacavir comes as a tablet and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice daily with or without food. Take abacavir at around the same time(s) every day.\n\n* Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\n* Take abacavir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nAbacavir helps to control HIV infection but does not cure it. Continue to take abacavir even if you feel well. Do not stop taking abacavir without talking to your doctor.\n\n* If you stop taking abacavir or skip doses, your condition may become more difficult to treat, or you could have an allergic reaction when restarting the medication.\n* Do not run out of medication. When your supply of abacavir starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n**Other Uses for This Medicine**\n\nAbacavir is also used in combination with other antiviral medications to prevent HIV infection in people who have been exposed to it.

Many x-rays or CT scans over time may increase your risk for cancer. However, the risk from any one scan is small. Most modern scanners are able to reduce the radiation exposure. Talk to your provider about this risk and the benefit of the test for getting a correct diagnosis of your medical problem.\n\nSome people have allergies to contrast dye. Let your provider know if you have ever had an allergic reaction to injected contrast dye.\n\nThe most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. If you have an iodine allergy, you may have nausea or vomiting, sneezing, itching, or hives if you get this type of contrast. If you must be given such contrast, your provider may give you antihistamines (such as Benadryl) or steroids before the test.\n\nYour kidneys help remove IV dye from the body. You may need extra fluids after the test to help flush the iodine out of your body if you have kidney disease or diabetes.\n\nRarely, the dye may cause a life-threatening allergic response.

The waves create pictures of the inside of the belly area. This test does not use radiation (x-rays).\n\n**How the Test Works**\n\n* Single magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images are called slices.\n* The images can be stored on a computer, viewed on a monitor, printed on film or scanned to a disk.\n* One exam produces dozens or sometimes hundreds of images.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\n* You may be asked to wear a hospital gown or clothing without metal zippers or snaps (such as sweatpants and a t-shirt).\n* Certain types of metal can cause blurry images.\n* You will lie on a narrow table. The table slides into a large tunnel-shaped scanner.\n* Some exams require a special dye (contrast). Most of the time, the dye is given during the test through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Before the Test**\n\n* Tell your health care provider if you are afraid of close spaces (have claustrophobia).\n* You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious.\n* Your provider may also suggest an open MRI, in which the machine is not as close to your body.\n* Before the test, tell your provider if you have:\n  * Artificial heart valves\n  * Brain aneurysm clips\n  * Heart defibrillator or pacemaker\n  * Inner ear (cochlear) implants\n  * Kidney disease or dialysis\n  * Recently placed artificial joints\n  * Certain types of vascular stents\n  * Worked with sheet metal in the past\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**During the Test**\n\n* The test lasts about 30 to 60 minutes, but it may take longer.\n* You will lie on a narrow table.

This is called an aneurysm. The aorta is the large artery that carries blood from your heart to your belly (abdomen), pelvis, and legs.\n\n**An Aortic Aneurysm**\n\nAn aortic aneurysm is when part of this artery becomes too large or balloons outward.\n\n**Description of the Surgery**\n\nThe surgery will take place in an operating room. You will be given general anesthesia (you will be asleep and pain-free).\n\nYour surgeon opens up your belly and replaces the aortic aneurysm with a man-made, cloth-like material.\n\nThere are two approaches to this surgery:\n\n*   In one approach, you will lie on your back. The surgeon will make a cut in the middle of your belly, from just below the breastbone to below the belly button.\n*   In another approach, you will lie slightly tilted on your right side. The surgeon will make a 5- to 6-inch (13 to 15 centimeters) cut from the left side of your belly, ending a little below your belly button.\n\n**How the Surgery is Done**\n\nYour surgeon will replace the aneurysm with a long tube made of man-made (synthetic) cloth. It is sewn in with stitches.\n\nIn some cases, the ends of this tube (or graft) will be moved through blood vessels in each groin and attached to those in the leg.\n\nOnce the surgery is done, your legs will be examined to make sure that there is a pulse. Most often a dye test using x-rays is done to confirm that there is good blood flow to the legs.\n\nThe cut is closed with sutures or staples.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nOpen surgery to repair an AAA is sometimes done as an emergency procedure when there is bleeding inside your body from the aneurysm.\n\nYou may have an AAA that is not causing any symptoms or problems. Your health care provider may have found the problem after you had an ultrasound or CT scan done for another reason.\n\nThere is a risk that this aneurysm may suddenly break open (rupture) if you do not have surgery to repair it. However, surgery to repair the aneurysm may also be risky, depending on your overall health.\n\nYou and your provider must decide whether the risk of having this surgery is smaller than the risk for rupture.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThe risks for this surgery are higher if you have:\n\n*   Heart disease\n*   Kidney failure\n*   Lung disease\n*   Past stroke\n*   Other serious medical problems\n\nComplications are also higher for older people.\n\nRisks for any surgery are:\n\n*   Blood clots in the legs that may travel to the lungs\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Heart attack or stroke\n*   Infection, including in the lungs (pneumonia), urinary tract, and belly\n*   Reactions to medicines\n\nRisks for this surgery are:\n\n*   Bleeding before or after surgery\n*   Damage to a nerve, causing pain or numbness in the leg\n*   Damage to your intestines or other nearby organs\n*   Loss of blood supply to a portion of the large intestine causing delayed bleeding in the stool\n*   Infection of the graft\n*   Injury to the ureter, the tube that carries urine from your kidneys to your bladder\n*   Kidney failure that may be permanent\n*   Lower sex drive or inability to get an erection\n*   Poor blood supply to your legs, your kidneys, or other organs\n*   Spinal cord injury\n*   Wound breaks open\n*   Wound infections\n*   Death\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nYou will have a physical exam and get tests before you have surgery.\n\nAlways tell your provider what medicines you are taking, even drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\n\nIf you are a smoker, you should stop smoking at least 4 weeks before your surgery. Your provider can help.\n\nDuring the 2 weeks before your surgery:\n\n*   You will have visits with your provider to make sure medical problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart or lung problems are well treated.\n*   You may be asked to stop taking drugs that make it harder for your blood to clot. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), clopidogrel (Plavix), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and other drugs like these.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nMost people stay in the hospital for 5 to 10 days. During a hospital stay, you will:\n\n*   Be in the intensive care unit (ICU), where you will be monitored very closely right after surgery. You may need a breathing machine during the first day.\n*   Have a urinary catheter.\n*   Have a tube that goes through your nose into your stomach to help drain fluids for 1 or 2 days. You will then slowly begin drinking, then eating.\n*   Receive medicine to keep your blood thin.\n*   Be encouraged to sit on the side of the bed and then walk.\n*   Wear special stockings to prevent blood clots in your legs.\n*   Be asked to use a breathing machine to help clear your lungs.\n*   Receive pain medicine into your veins or into the space that surrounds your spinal cord (epidural).\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nFull recovery for open surgery to repair an aortic aneurysm may take 2 or 3 months. Most people make a full recovery from this surgery.\n\nMost people who have an aneurysm repaired before it breaks open (ruptures) have a good outlook.\n\n---\n\n**Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair - Open**\n\n**What is an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm?**\n\nAn aortic aneurysm is when part of the large artery that carries blood from your heart to your belly (abdomen), pelvis, and legs becomes too large or balloons outward.\n\n**Why is Surgery Needed?**\n\nYou may have an AAA that is not causing any symptoms or problems.

Only about 1 in 5 people survive a ruptured abdominal aneurysm.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nGo to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have pain in your belly or back that is very bad or does not go away.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo reduce the risk of aneurysms:\n\n*   Eat a heart-healthy diet, exercise, stop smoking (if you smoke), and reduce stress.\n*   If you have high blood pressure or diabetes, take your medicines as your provider has told you.\n*   People over age 65 who have ever smoked should have a screening ultrasound done once.\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\nAneurysm - aortic; AAA\n\n**References**\n\n1.

The aorta is the largest artery in the body, and it carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Age: AAA is more common in people over 60 years old.\n*   Smoking: Smoking increases the risk of developing an AAA.\n*   High blood pressure: Uncontrolled high blood pressure can increase the risk of developing an AAA.\n*   Family history: A family history of AAA or other vascular diseases may increase the risk.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nMost people with an AAA do not have symptoms until the aneurysm ruptures. However, some people may experience:\n\n*   Pain in the abdomen or back\n*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Fever\n*   Rapid heartbeat\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nTo diagnose an AAA, a doctor will perform a physical exam and take a medical history. They may also order imaging tests, such as:\n\n*   Ultrasound: Uses sound waves to create images of the aorta.\n*   CT scan: Uses X-rays to create detailed images of the aorta.\n*   MRI: Uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the aorta.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe goal of treatment is to prevent rupture and repair the aneurysm. Treatment options include:\n\n*   **Open surgery**: A surgeon makes an incision in the abdomen to repair the aneurysm.\n*   **Endovascular repair**: A surgeon uses a catheter to insert a stent-graft into the aorta to repair the aneurysm.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo prevent AAA, it is essential to:\n\n*   Maintain a healthy weight\n*   Exercise regularly\n*   Quit smoking\n*   Manage high blood pressure and other health conditions\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Topics**\n\n*   Aortic Aneurysm\n*   Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair - Open - Discharge\n*   Aortic Aneurysm Repair - Endovascular - Discharge",

However, insoluble fiber such as bran can cause more bloating and gas. Soluble fiber supplements such as psyllium are usually better tolerated.\n\nYou may try simethicone and other medicines that you can buy at the drugstore to help with gas. Charcoal caps can also help. Be aware that charcoal will turn your stool black. It is not harmful, but it is good to be aware of this effect.\n\nWatch for foods that trigger your bloating so you can start to avoid those foods.

Most of the time, the mass develops slowly. You may not be able to feel the mass.\n\nLocating the mass helps your health care provider make a diagnosis. For example, the abdomen can be divided into four areas:\n\n* Right-upper quadrant\n* Left-upper quadrant\n* Right-lower quadrant\n* Left-lower quadrant\n\nOther terms used to describe the location of abdominal pain or masses include:\n\n* Epigastric -- center of the abdomen just below the rib cage\n* Periumbilical -- area around the belly button\n\nThe location of the mass and its firmness, texture, and other qualities can provide clues to its cause.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nSeveral conditions can cause an abdominal mass:\n\n* Abdominal aortic aneurysm can cause a pulsating mass around the navel.\n* Bladder distention (urinary bladder over-filled with fluid) can cause a firm mass in the center of the lower abdomen above the pelvic bones. In extreme cases, it can reach as far up as the navel.\n* Cholecystitis can cause a very tender mass that is felt below the liver in the right-upper quadrant (occasionally).\n* Colon cancer can cause a mass almost anywhere in the abdomen.\n* Crohn disease or bowel obstruction can cause many tender, sausage-shaped masses anywhere in the abdomen.\n* Diverticulitis can cause a mass that is usually located in the left-lower quadrant.\n* Gallbladder tumor can cause a tender, irregularly shaped mass in the right-upper quadrant.\n* Hydronephrosis (fluid-filled kidney) can cause a smooth, spongy-feeling mass in one or both sides or toward the back (flank area).\n* Kidney cancer can sometimes cause a smooth, firm, but not tender mass in the abdomen.\n* Liver cancer can cause a firm, lumpy mass in the right upper quadrant.\n* Liver enlargement (hepatomegaly) can cause a firm, irregular mass below the right rib cage, or on the left side in the stomach area.\n* Neuroblastoma, a cancerous tumor often found in the lower abdomen can cause a mass (this cancer mainly occurs in children and infants).\n* Ovarian cyst can cause a smooth, rounded, rubbery mass above the pelvis in the lower abdomen.\n* Pancreatic abscess can cause a mass in the upper abdomen in the epigastric area.\n* Pancreatic pseudocyst can cause a lumpy mass in the upper abdomen in the epigastric area.\n* Pregnancy causes a mass above the pelvis in the lower abdomen that may be mistaken for an illness.\n* Spleen enlargement (splenomegaly) can sometimes be felt in the left-upper quadrant.\n* Stomach cancer can cause a mass in the left-upper abdomen in the stomach area (epigastric) if the cancer is large.\n* Uterine leiomyoma (fibroids) can cause a round, lumpy mass above the pelvis in the lower abdomen (sometimes can be felt if the fibroids are large).\n* Volvulus can cause a mass anywhere in the abdomen.\n* Ureteropelvic junction obstruction can cause a mass in the lower abdomen.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Home Care**\n\nAll abdominal masses should be examined as soon as possible by the provider.\n\nChanging your body position may help relieve pain due to an abdominal mass.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nGet medical help right away if you have a pulsating lump in your abdomen along with severe abdominal pain.

This is often referred to as the stomach region or belly.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Considerations**\n\nAlmost everyone has pain in the abdomen at some point. Most of the time, it is not serious.\n\nHow bad your pain is does not always reflect the seriousness of the condition causing the pain.\n\nFor example, you might have very bad abdominal pain if you have gas or stomach cramps due to viral gastroenteritis.\n\nHowever, potentially fatal conditions, such as colon cancer or early appendicitis, may only cause mild pain or no pain.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of Abdominal Pain**\n\n*   *Generalized pain*: This means that you feel it in more than half of your belly. This type of pain is more typical for a stomach virus, indigestion, or gas.\n*   *Localized pain*: This is pain found in only one area of your belly. It is more likely to be a sign of a problem in an organ, such as the appendix, gallbladder, or stomach.\n*   *Cramp-like pain*: This type of pain is not serious most of the time. It is likely to be due to gas and bloating, and is often followed by diarrhea.\n*   *Colicky pain*: This type of pain comes in waves. It very often starts and ends suddenly, and is often severe.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nMany different conditions can cause abdominal pain.

Your specific symptoms, the location of pain and when it occurs will help your provider detect the cause.\n\nLOCATION OF YOUR PAIN\n\n*   Where do you feel the pain?\n*   Is it all over or in one spot?\n*   Does the pain move into your back, groin, or down your legs?\n\nTYPE AND INTENSITY OF YOUR PAIN\n\n*   Is the pain severe, sharp, or cramping?\n*   Do you have it all the time, or does it come and go?\n*   Does the pain wake you up at night?\n\nHISTORY OF YOUR PAIN\n\n*   Have you had similar pain in the past? How long has each episode lasted?\n*   When does the pain occur? For example, after meals or during menstruation?\n*   What makes the pain worse? For example, eating, stress, or lying down?\n*   What makes the pain better? For example, drinking milk, having a bowel movement, or taking an antacid?\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Tests that may be done include:**\n\n*   Barium enema\n*   Blood, urine, and stool tests\n*   CT scan\n*   Colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy (tube through the rectum into the colon)\n*   Electrocardiogram (ECG) or heart tracing\n*   Ultrasound of the abdomen\n*   Upper endoscopy (tube through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach and upper small intestine)\n*   Upper GI (gastrointestinal) and small bowel series\n*   X-rays of the abdomen\n\n---\n\n**Abdominal Pain**\n\nAbdominal pain is pain that you feel anywhere between your chest and groin. This is often referred to as the stomach region or belly.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Understanding Abdominal Pain**\n\nAlmost everyone has pain in the abdomen at some point. Most of the time, it is not serious. How bad your pain is does not always reflect the seriousness of the condition causing the pain.\n\nFor example, you might have very bad abdominal pain if you have gas or stomach cramps due to viral gastroenteritis. However, potentially fatal conditions, such as colon cancer or early appendicitis, may only cause mild pain or no pain.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Types of Abdominal Pain**\n\nOther ways to describe pain in your abdomen include:\n\n*   *Generalized pain*: This means that you feel it in more than half of your belly. This type of pain is more typical for a stomach virus, indigestion, or gas.\n*   *Localized pain*: This is pain found in only one area of your belly. It is more likely to be a sign of a problem in an organ, such as the appendix, gallbladder, or stomach.\n*   *Cramp-like pain*: This type of pain is not serious most of the time. It is likely to be due to gas and bloating, and is often followed by diarrhea.\n*   *Colicky pain*: This type of pain comes in waves. It very often starts and ends suddenly, and is often severe.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes of Abdominal Pain**\n\nMany different conditions can cause abdominal pain.

The following information provides an overview of abdominal sounds.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe causes of abdominal sounds can vary depending on the individual case. Some possible causes include:\n\n*   *Bowel obstruction*: A blockage in the intestines that prevents normal movement of food and waste.\n*   *Inflammatory bowel disease*: Conditions such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis that cause inflammation and irritation in the digestive tract.\n*   *Gastrointestinal infections*: Bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections that affect the digestive system.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms of abdominal sounds can include:\n\n*   *Abdominal pain*: Pain or discomfort in the abdomen, which may be severe or mild.\n*   *Bloating and gas*: Feeling bloated or experiencing gas in the abdomen.\n*   *Changes in bowel movements*: Diarrhea, constipation, or changes in stool consistency.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nTo diagnose abdominal sounds, a healthcare provider will typically:\n\n*   *Conduct a physical examination*: The provider will examine the abdomen to check for tenderness, swelling, or other abnormalities.\n*   *Ask questions about medical history and symptoms*: The provider will ask about the individual's medical history, including any previous digestive issues, and their current symptoms.\n*   *Order tests*: Depending on the suspected cause of abdominal sounds, the provider may order imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs to visualize the digestive system.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for abdominal sounds will depend on the underlying cause. Some possible treatments include:\n\n*   *Medications*: Antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medications, or other medications to manage symptoms and treat the underlying condition.\n*   *Surgery*: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to relieve a bowel obstruction or repair damage to the digestive system.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo prevent abdominal sounds, individuals can take steps such as:\n\n*   *Maintaining a healthy diet*: Eating a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n*   *Staying hydrated*: Drinking enough water to help prevent constipation and other digestive issues.\n*   *Managing stress*: Engaging in stress-reducing activities such as exercise, meditation, or yoga.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**References**\n\nThis information is based on the following sources:\n\n*   Ball JW, Dains JE, Flynn JA, Solomon BS, Stewart RW.

Without oxygen, brain damage can occur in as little as 4 to 6 minutes. Rapid first aid for choking can save a person's life.\n\n**What are Abdominal Thrusts?**\n\nAbdominal thrusts is an emergency technique to help clear someone's airway.\n\nThe procedure is done on someone who is choking and also conscious.\nMost experts do not recommend abdominal thrusts for infants less than 1 year old.\nYou can also perform the maneuver on yourself.\n\n**First Aid for Choking**\n\n* First ask, \"Are you choking? Can you speak?\" DO NOT perform first aid if the person is coughing forcefully and is able to speak. A strong cough can often dislodge the object.\n\nIf the person is choking, perform abdominal thrusts as follows:\n\n* If the person is sitting or standing, position yourself behind the person and reach your arms around their waist. For a child, you may have to kneel.\n* Place your fist, thumb side in, just above the person's navel (belly button).\n* Grasp the fist tightly with your other hand.\n* Make quick, upward and inward thrusts with your fist.\n* If the person is lying on their back, straddle the person facing the head. Push your grasped fist upward and inward in a movement similar to the one above.\n\nYou may need to repeat the procedure several times before the object is dislodged. If repeated attempts do not free the airway, call 911 or the local emergency number.\n\nIf the person loses consciousness, start CPR.\n\n**Alternative Options**\n\nIf you are not comfortable performing abdominal thrusts, you can perform back blows instead on a person who is choking.\n\n**References**\n\n* American Red Cross.

A computer receives these waves and uses them to create a picture. Unlike with x-rays or CT scans, this test does not expose you to ionizing radiation.\n\nYou will be lying down for the procedure. A clear, water-based conducting gel is applied to the skin over the abdomen to help with the transmission of sound waves. A handheld probe called a transducer is then moved over the abdomen.\n\nYou may need to change position so that the health care provider can look at different areas. You may also need to hold your breath for short periods during the exam. Most of the time, the test takes less than 30 minutes.\n\n**How to Prepare for the Test**\n\nHow you will prepare for the test depends on the problem. You will likely be asked not to eat or drink for several hours before the exam. Your health care provider will go over what you need to do.\n\n**How the Test will Feel**\n\nThere is little discomfort. The conducting gel may feel a little cold and wet. The sonographer may press the probe against your abdomen.\n\n**Why the Test is Performed**\n\nYou may have this test to:\n\n* Find the cause of abdominal pain\n* Find the cause of kidney infections\n* Diagnose or monitor tumors and cancers\n* Diagnose or treat ascites\n* Learn why there is swelling of an abdominal organ\n* Look for damage after an injury\n* Look for stones in the gallbladder or kidney\n* Look for the cause of abnormal blood tests such as liver function tests or kidney tests\n* Look for the cause of a fever\n\n**Normal Results**\n\nThe organs examined appear normal.\n\n**What Abnormal Results Mean**\n\nThe meaning of abnormal results depends on the organ being examined and the type of problem.

There are two main types of abdominal wall defects: omphalocele and gastroschisis.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAbdominal wall defects are rare, affecting approximately 2 to 6 in 10,000 newborns. Omphalocele affects an estimated 2 to 2.5 in 10,000 newborns. These conditions are more common among pregnancies that do not survive to term (miscarriages and stillbirths).\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact causes of abdominal wall defects are unknown, but multiple genetic and environmental factors likely play a role in their development.\n\n* Omphalocele occurs during an error in digestive tract development. During the formation of the abdominal cavity in the sixth to tenth weeks of fetal development, the intestines normally protrude into the umbilical cord but recede back into the abdomen as development continues. Omphalocele occurs when the intestines do not recede back into the abdomen, but remain in the umbilical cord.\n* Gastroschisis is thought to be caused by either a disruption in the blood flow to the digestive tract or a lack of development or injury to gastrointestinal tissue early in fetal development.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nWomen under the age of 20 are at the greatest risk of having a baby with gastroschisis. Other potential risk factors include:\n\n* Taking medications that constrict the blood vessels (vasoconstrictive drugs)\n* Smoking\n\nHowever, these risk factors have not been confirmed.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\nMost cases of abdominal wall defect are sporadic, occurring in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Multiple genetic and environmental factors likely play a part in determining the risk of developing this disorder.\n\nWhen an abdominal wall defect is a feature of a genetic condition, it is inherited in the pattern of that condition.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\n* Abdominal hernia\n* Gastroschisis\n* Hernia, abdominal\n* Omphalocele\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\nFor more information on abdominal wall defects, please see the following resources:\n\n* National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n* ClinicalTrials.gov\n* Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIM:\n\t+ OMPHALOCELE, AUTOSOMAL\n\t+ GASTROSCHISIS\n\t+ OMPHALOCELE, X-LINKED\n\n---\n\n**Abdominal Wall Defect**\n\n**What is an Abdominal Wall Defect?**\n\nAn abdominal wall defect is a birth defect where the muscles and tissues of the abdomen do not form properly, causing part of the intestines or other organs to protrude through the navel.\n\n**Types of Abdominal Wall Defects**\n\n*   **Omphalocele**: A type of abdominal wall defect where the intestines or other organs protrude through the navel.\n*   **Gastroschisis**: A type of abdominal wall defect where a hole in the abdominal wall allows the intestines to protrude.\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nThe exact cause of an abdominal wall defect is not known, but it is believed to be related to genetic factors. Some risk factors include:\n\n*   Family history\n*   Genetic disorders\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nAbdominal wall defects can cause a range of symptoms, including:\n\n*   Intestinal blockage\n*   Infection\n*   Respiratory problems\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nAbdominal wall defects are typically diagnosed during pregnancy using ultrasound or other imaging tests.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThe treatment for an abdominal wall defect depends on the type and severity of the condition. Some possible treatments include:\n\n*   Surgery to repair the defect\n*   Prenatal surgery to repair the defect before birth\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for a child with an abdominal wall defect depends on the type and severity of the condition. In some cases, the defect can be repaired surgically, while in other cases, it may require ongoing medical care.\n\n**Genetics and Abdominal Wall Defects**\n\nAbdominal wall defects can be caused by genetic factors, including:\n\n*   **Autosomal**: A type of inheritance where the defect is caused by a mutation in a gene that is not sex-linked.\n*   **X-linked**: A type of inheritance where the defect is caused by a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Christison-Lagay ER, Kelleher CM, Langer JC.

  "98e8f87a808c55a86b36da458bf38554": "**Abdominal Wall Surgery**\n\n**What is Abdominal Wall Surgery?**\n\nAbdominal wall surgery, also known as a tummy tuck, is a procedure that improves the appearance of flabby, stretched-out abdominal muscles and skin. It can range from a simple mini-tummy tuck to more extensive surgery.\n\n**Description**\n\nYour surgery will be done in an operating room in a hospital. You will receive general anesthesia, which will keep you asleep and pain-free during the procedure. The surgery takes 2 to 6 hours, and you can expect to stay in the hospital for 1 to 3 days after surgery.\n\nAfter receiving anesthesia, your surgeon will make a cut (incision) across your abdomen to open up the area. This cut will be just above your pubic area.\n\n* Your surgeon will remove fatty tissue and loose skin from the middle and lower sections of your abdomen to make it firmer and flatter.\n* In extended surgeries, the surgeon also removes excess fat and skin (love handles) from the sides of the abdomen.\n* Your abdominal muscles may be tightened also.\n\n**Types of Surgery**\n\n* Mini abdominoplasty is performed when there are areas of fat pockets (love handles). It can be done with much smaller cuts.\n* For less complicated surgery, your surgeon may use a medical device called an endoscope. Endoscopes are small cameras that are inserted into the skin through very small cuts.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nMost of the time, this surgery is an elective or cosmetic procedure because it is an operation you choose to have. It is not usually needed for health reasons. Cosmetic abdomen repair can help improve appearance, particularly after a lot of weight gain or loss. It helps flatten the lower abdomen and tighten stretched skin.\n\nIt may also help relieve skin rashes or infections that develop under large flaps of skin.\n\nAbdominoplasty can be helpful when:\n\n* Diet and exercise have not helped improve muscle tone.\n* Skin and muscle cannot regain its normal tone, particularly in very overweight people who lost a lot of weight.\n\n**Risks**\n\nRisks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n\n* Reactions to medicines\n* Breathing problems\n* Bleeding, blood clots, or infection\n\nRisks for this surgery are:\n\n* Excessive scarring\n* Loss of skin\n* Nerve damage that can cause pain or numbness in part of your belly\n* Poor healing\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nTell your surgeon or nurse:\n\n* If you could be pregnant\n* What medicines you are taking, even medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\n\nBefore surgery:\n\n* Several days before surgery, you may be asked to temporarily stop taking blood thinners.\n* Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\n* If you smoke, try to stop. Smoking increases the risk for problems such as slow healing.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nYou will have some pain and discomfort for several days after surgery. Your surgeon will prescribe pain medicine to help you manage your pain. It may help to rest with your legs and hips bent during recovery to reduce pressure on your abdomen.\n\n* Wearing an elastic support similar to a girdle for 2 to 3 weeks will provide extra support while you heal.\n* You should avoid strenuous activity and anything that makes you strain for 4 to 6 weeks.\n* You will probably be able to return to work in 2 to 4 weeks.\n\nYour scars will become flatter and lighter in color over the next year.

Many feel a new sense of self-confidence.\n\n---\n\n**Abdominal Wall Surgery**\n\n**What is Abdominal Wall Surgery?**\n\nAbdominal wall surgery, also known as a tummy tuck, is a procedure that improves the appearance of flabby, stretched-out abdominal (belly) muscles and skin.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Why is the Procedure Performed?**\n\nMost of the time, this surgery is an elective or cosmetic procedure because it is an operation you choose to have. It is not usually needed for health reasons. Cosmetic abdomen repair can help improve appearance, particularly after a lot of weight gain or loss. It helps flatten the lower abdomen and tighten stretched skin.\n\n* Abdominoplasty can be helpful when:\n  * Diet and exercise have not helped improve muscle tone, such as in women who have had more than one pregnancy.\n  * Skin and muscle cannot regain its normal tone. This can be a problem for very overweight people who lost a lot of weight.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Risks**\n\n* Risks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:\n  + Reactions to medicines\n  + Breathing problems\n  + Bleeding, blood clots, or infection\n* Risks for this surgery are:\n  + Excessive scarring\n  + Loss of skin\n  + Nerve damage that can cause pain or numbness in part of your belly\n  + Poor healing\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\n* Tell your surgeon or nurse:\n  + If you could be pregnant\n  + What medicines you are taking, even medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\n* Before surgery:\n  + Several days before surgery, you may be asked to temporarily stop taking blood thinners. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and others.\n  + Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\n  + If you smoke, try to stop. Smoking increases the risk for problems such as slow healing. Ask your health care provider for help quitting.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\n* You will have some pain and discomfort for several days after surgery. Your surgeon will prescribe pain medicine to help you manage your pain.\n* It may help to rest with your legs and hips bent during recovery to reduce pressure on your abdomen.\n* Wearing an elastic support similar to a girdle for 2 to 3 weeks will provide extra support while you heal.\n* You should avoid strenuous activity and anything that makes you strain for 4 to 6 weeks. You will probably be able to return to work in 2 to 4 weeks.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMost people are happy with the results of abdominoplasty. Many feel a new sense of self-confidence.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Description**\n\nYour surgery will be done in an operating room in a hospital. You will receive general anesthesia. This will keep you asleep and pain-free during the procedure. The surgery takes 2 to 6 hours. You can expect to stay in the hospital for 1 to 3 days after surgery.\n\n* After you receive anesthesia, your surgeon will make a cut (incision) across your abdomen to open up the area. This cut will be just above your pubic area.\n* Your surgeon will remove fatty tissue and loose skin from the middle and lower sections of your abdomen to make it firmer and flatter. In extended surgeries, the surgeon also removes excess fat and skin (love handles) from the sides of the abdomen. Your abdominal muscles may be tightened also.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Alternative Names**\n\n* Cosmetic surgery of the abdomen\n* Tummy tuck\n* Abdominoplasty\n\n---\n\n**Abdominal Wall Surgery**\n\n**What to Expect During the Procedure**\n\nYour surgery will be done in an operating room in a hospital.

Your abdominal muscles may be tightened also.\n\n**Mini Abdominoplasty**\n\nThis is a type of abdominoplasty that is performed when there are areas of fat pockets (love handles). It can be done with much smaller cuts.\n\n**Closing the Incision**\n\nYour surgeon will close your cut with stitches. Small tubes called drains may be inserted to allow fluid to drain out of your cut. These will be removed later.\n\nA firm elastic dressing (bandage) will be placed over your abdomen.\n\n**Endoscopic Surgery**\n\nFor less complicated surgery, your surgeon may use a medical device called an endoscope. Endoscopes are small cameras that are inserted into the skin through very small cuts. They are connected to a video monitor in the operating room that allows the surgeon to see the area being worked on. Your surgeon will remove excess fat with other small tools that are inserted through other small cuts.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\nMost of the time, this surgery is an elective or cosmetic procedure because it is an operation you choose to have.

Many of the signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia result from a severe shortage (deficiency) of fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, E, and K). The signs and symptoms of this condition primarily affect the gastrointestinal system, eyes, nervous system, and blood.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\\n\\n\n* Failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive)\n* Diarrhea\n* Fatty, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea)\n\nAs an individual with this condition ages, additional signs and symptoms include:\n\n* Disturbances in nerve function that may lead to poor muscle coordination and difficulty with balance and movement (ataxia)\n* Loss of certain reflexes\n* Impaired speech (dysarthria)\n* Tremors or other involuntary movements (motor tics)\n* Loss of sensation in the extremities (peripheral neuropathy) or muscle weakness\n* Abnormally curved lower back (lordosis), a rounded upper back that also curves to the side (kyphoscoliosis), high-arched feet (pes cavus), or an inward- and upward-turning foot (clubfoot)\n\n**Eye Problems**\n\\n\\n\nIndividuals with this condition may develop an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa, in which breakdown of the light-sensitive layer (retina) at the back of the eye can cause vision loss. They may also experience:\n\n* Involuntary eye movements (nystagmus)\n* Eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus)\n* Weakness of the external muscles of the eye (ophthalmoplegia)\n\n**Blood-Related Problems**\n\\n\\n\nIndividuals with abetalipoproteinemia usually have a low number of red blood cells (anemia) with abnormally star-shaped red blood cells (acanthocytosis) and difficulty forming blood clots, which can cause abnormal bleeding. In some cases, a condition called fatty liver develops, which can cause liver damage.\n\n**Causes**\n\\n\\n\nAbetalipoproteinemia is an inherited disorder that impairs the normal absorption of fats and certain vitamins from the diet.\n\n**Inheritance**\n\\n\\n\nThe exact inheritance pattern of abetalipoproteinemia is not well understood. However, it is known to be caused by mutations in the MTTP gene.\n\n**Other Names for This Condition**\n\\n\\n\nAbetalipoproteinemia is also known as Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome or acanthocytosis with vitamin E deficiency.\n\n**Additional Information & Resources**\n\\n\\n\nFor more information about abetalipoproteinemia, you can visit the National Institutes of Health (NIH) website at [www.nih.gov](http://www.nih.gov).\n\n**References**\n\\n\\n\nThis article was adapted from MedlinePlus Genetics.\n\n---\n\n**Abetalipoproteinemia**\n\n**Category:** Diseases\n\n**What are the symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia?**\n\n* Failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive)\n* Diarrhea\n* Fatty, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea)\n\nAs an individual with this condition ages, additional signs and symptoms include:\n\n* Disturbances in nerve function that may lead to poor muscle coordination and difficulty with balance and movement (ataxia)\n* Loss of certain reflexes\n* Impaired speech (dysarthria)\n* Tremors or other involuntary movements (motor tics)\n* Loss of sensation in the extremities (peripheral neuropathy) or muscle weakness\n* Abnormally curved lower back (lordosis), a rounded upper back that also curves to the side (kyphoscoliosis), high-arched feet (pes cavus), or an inward- and upward-turning foot (clubfoot)\n\n**Eye Problems**\n\n* Retinitis pigmentosa, which can cause vision loss\n* Involuntary eye movements (nystagmus)\n* Eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus)\n* Weakness of the external muscles of the eye (ophthalmoplegia)\n\n**Blood and Liver Problems**\n\n* Low number of red blood cells (anemia) with abnormally star-shaped red blood cells (acanthocytosis)\n* Difficulty forming blood clots, which can cause abnormal bleeding\n* Fatty liver, which can cause liver damage\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAbetalipoproteinemia is a rare disorder. More than 100 cases have been described worldwide.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nAbetalipoproteinemia is caused by mutations in the MTTP gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called microsomal triglyceride transfer protein. This protein is essential for creating molecules called beta-lipoproteins in the liver and intestine. Beta-lipoproteins transport fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins from the intestine to the bloodstream so these nutrients can be taken up by tissues throughout the body.\n\nMost MTTP gene mutations lead to the production of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein with reduced or absent function and unable to help in the formation of beta-lipoproteins. A lack of beta-lipoproteins causes severely reduced absorption (malabsorption) of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the digestive tract into the bloodstream. These nutritional deficiencies lead to health problems in people with abetalipoproteinemia.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Genetics**\n\nLearn more about the gene associated with Abetalipoproteinemia:\n\n* MTTP\n\n---\n\n**Abetalipoproteinemia**\n\n\\n\\n\n**What is Abetalipoproteinemia?**\n\nAbetalipoproteinemia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the formation of beta-lipoproteins.

Bleeding may be heavier or lighter than usual and occur often or randomly.\n\n**When Does AUB Occur?**\n\nAUB can occur:\n\n* As spotting or bleeding between your periods\n* After sex\n* If you period goes on for more days than your normal period\n* If your period is heavier than normal\n* After menopause\n\nIt does not occur during pregnancy. Bleeding during pregnancy has different causes. If you have any bleeding when you are pregnant, be sure to contact your health care provider.\n\n**Causes of AUB**\n\nEvery woman's menstrual cycle is different.\n\n* On average, a woman's period (menstrual flow) occurs every 28 days, although cycles may vary from 24 to 34 days.\n* Menstruation flow normally last about 4 to 7 days.\n* Young girls may get their periods anywhere from 21 to 45 days or more apart.\n* Women in their 40s may start to have their period less often or have the interval between their periods decrease.\n\nFor most women, female hormone levels change every month. The hormones estrogen and progesterone are released as part of the process of ovulation. When a woman ovulates, an egg is released.\n\nAUB can occur when the ovaries do not release an egg. Changes in hormone levels cause your period to be later or earlier. Your period may sometimes be heavier than normal.\n\n**Risk Factors for AUB**\n\n* AUB is more common in teenagers or in premenopausal women.\n* Women who are overweight also may be more likely to have AUB.\n* Hormonal imbalance\n* Thickening of the uterine wall or lining\n* Uterine fibroids\n* Uterine polyps\n* Cancers of ovary, uterus, cervix, or vagina\n* Bleeding disorders or problems with blood clotting\n* Polycystic ovary syndrome\n* Severe weight loss\n* Hormonal birth control, such as birth control pills or intrauterine devices (IUD)\n* Excessive weight gain or loss (more than 10 pounds or 4.5 kilograms)\n* Infection of the uterus or cervix\n\n**Symptoms of AUB**\n\nAUB is unpredictable. The bleeding may be very heavy or light, and can occur often or randomly.\n\n* Bleeding or spotting from the vagina between periods\n* Periods that occur less than 28 days apart (more common) or more than 35 days apart\n* Time between periods changes each month\n* Heavier bleeding (such as passing large clots, needing to change protection during the night, soaking through a sanitary pad or tampon every hour for 2 to 3 hours in a row)\n* Bleeding that lasts for more days than normal or for more than 7 days\n\nOther symptoms caused by changes in hormone levels may include:\n\n* Excessive growth of body hair in a male pattern (hirsutism)\n* Hot flashes\n* Mood swings\n* Tenderness and dryness of the vagina\n\nA woman may feel tired or fatigued if she loses too much blood over time. This is a symptom of anemia.\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nYour provider will rule out other possible causes of irregular bleeding. You will likely have a pelvic exam and Pap/HPV test. Other tests that may be done include:\n\n* Complete blood count (CBC)\n* Blood clotting profile\n* Liver function tests (LFT)\n* Fasting blood glucose or hemoglobin A1C\n* Hormone tests, for FSH, LH, male hormone (androgen) levels, prolactin, and progesterone\n* Pregnancy test\n* Thyroid function tests\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment may include one or more of the following:\n\n* Low-dose birth control pills\n* Hormone therapy\n* High-dose estrogen therapy for women with very heavy bleeding\n* Intrauterine device (IUD) that releases the hormone progestin\n* Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) taken just before the period starts\n* Tranexamic acid, which is a prescription medicine that treats heavy menstrual bleeding.\n* Surgery, if the cause of the bleeding is a polyp or fibroid\n\nYour provider may prescribe iron supplements if you have anemia.\n\nIf you want to get pregnant, you may be given medicine to stimulate ovulation.\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications that may occur:\n\n* Infertility (inability to get pregnant)\n* Severe anemia due to a lot of blood loss over time\n* Increased risk for endometrial cancer\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nContact your provider if you have unusual vaginal bleeding.\n\n---\n\n**Abnormal Uterine Bleeding**\n\n\\n\\n\n**What is Abnormal Uterine Bleeding?**\n\nAbnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is bleeding from the uterus that is longer than usual or that occurs at an irregular time.

Skin with too much melanin is called hyperpigmented skin, while skin with too little melanin is called hypopigmented. Skin with no melanin at all is called depigmented.\n\n*   **Hyperpigmentation**: This occurs when there is an overproduction of melanin or when melanocytes are overactive.\n*   **Hypopigmentation**: This occurs when there is a lack of melanin or when melanocytes are underactive.\n*   **Depigmentation**: This occurs when there is no production of melanin.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe causes of hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation include:\n\n*   **Hyperpigmentation:**\n    *   Skin inflammation (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation)\n    *   Use of certain drugs (such as minocycline, certain cancer chemotherapies, and birth control pills)\n    *   Hormone system diseases such as Addison disease\n    *   Hemochromatosis (iron overload)\n    *   Sun exposure\n    *   Pregnancy (melasma, or mask of pregnancy)\n    *   Certain birthmarks\n    *   Skin condition called acanthosis nigricans\n*   **Hypopigmentation:**\n    *   Skin inflammation (post-inflammatory hypopigmentation)\n    *   Certain fungal infections (such as tinea versicolor)\n    *   Pityriasis alba\n    *   Vitiligo\n    *   Certain medicines\n    *   Skin condition called idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis in sun-exposed areas such as the arms\n    *   Certain birthmarks\n\n**Home Care**\n\nOver-the-counter and prescription creams are available for lightening the skin. Hydroquinone combined with tretinoin is an effective combination. If you use these creams, follow instructions carefully, and don't use one for more than 3 weeks at a time. Darker skin requires greater care when using these preparations. Cosmetics may also help mask a discoloration.\n\n*   **Avoid too much sun exposure**: Always use sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher.\n*   **Abnormally dark skin may continue even after treatment**.\n\n**When to Contact a Medical Professional**\n\nCall your health care provider for an appointment if you have:\n\n*   Skin discoloration that causes significant concern\n*   Persistent, unexplained darkening or lightening of the skin\n*   Any skin sore or lesion that changes shape, size, or color may be a sign of skin cancer\n\n**What to Expect at Your Office Visit**\n\nYour provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms, including:\n\n*   When did the discoloration develop?\n*   Did it develop suddenly?\n*   Is it getting worse? How fast?\n*   Has it spread to other parts of the body?\n*   What medicines do you take?\n*   Has anyone else in your family had a similar problem?\n*   How often are you in the sun? Do you use a sun lamp or go to tanning salons?\n*   What is your diet like?\n*   What other symptoms do you have? For example, are there any rashes or skin lesions?\n\n**Tests that may be done include:**\n\n*   Adrenocorticotrophin hormone stimulation test\n*   Skin biopsy\n*   Thyroid function studies\n*   Wood lamp test\n*   KOH test\n\nYour provider may recommend creams, ointments, surgery, or phototherapy, depending on the type of skin condition you have.

  "63ce6bcc4cce2816f41eef6346f64668": "**Abortion - Medication**\n\n**Category:** General\n\nA medication abortion is the use of medicine to end an undesired pregnancy. The medicine helps remove the fetus and placenta from the woman's womb (uterus). Medication abortion is also called the abortion pill.\n\nA medication abortion is not the same as a miscarriage. Miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends on its own before the 20th week of pregnancy. Miscarriage is sometimes called a spontaneous abortion.\n\nAn abortion procedure uses a medical procedure to end a pregnancy.\n\n**Description**\n\nA medication abortion can be done within 11 weeks of the first day of the woman's last period. A combination of two prescription hormone medicines is most often used to help the body expel the fetus and placenta tissue. Your health care provider may prescribe the medicines for you after doing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history.\n\nMedicines used are mifepristone and misoprostol. Your provider will prescribe the medicines, and you will take them at home. Some providers may require you to take the mifepristone in their office before you leave.\n\nAfter you take the medicine, your body will expel the pregnancy tissue. Most women have moderate to heavy bleeding and cramping for several hours. You may have nausea, diarrhea, and sometimes vomiting from taking misoprostol. Your provider may prescribe medicine for pain and nausea to ease your discomfort during this process.\n\n**Why the Procedure is Performed**\n\n*   You have made a personal decision to not carry the pregnancy.\n*   Your baby has a severe birth defect or genetic problem.\n*   Your pregnancy may be harmful to your health.\n*   The pregnancy resulted after a traumatic event such as rape or incest.\n\nThe decision to end a pregnancy is very personal. To help weigh your choices, you may want to discuss your feelings with a counselor, provider, or a family member or friend.\n\n**Risks**\n\nMedication abortion is very safe and has been used in the United States for more than 20 years. Rare risks of medication abortion include:\n\n*   The medication abortion does not work and the pregnancy does not end\n*   Continued vaginal bleeding\n*   Pregnancy tissue not passing completely from body\n*   Blood clots in the uterus\n*   Infection\n*   Allergic reaction to one of the abortion medicines\n\n**Before the Procedure**\n\nBefore the procedure, you may have the following tests:\n\n*   Pelvic exam to confirm the pregnancy and estimate how many weeks pregnant you are.\n*   A urine or blood HCG test to confirm that you are pregnant.\n*   A blood test checks your blood type. Based on the test result, you may need a special shot to prevent problems if you get pregnant in the future. The shot is called Rho(D) immune globulin (RhoGAM and other brands).\n*   An ultrasound test to check how many weeks pregnant you are and the location of the fetus in the uterus.\n\n**After the Procedure**\n\nIt is very important to follow-up with your provider. This is to make sure the process was completed and all the tissue was expelled. The medicine may not work in a very small number of women. If this happens, another dose of the medicine or an abortion procedure may need to be done.\n\nPhysical recovery most often occurs within a few days. It will depend on the stage of the pregnancy. Expect some vaginal bleeding and mild cramping for a few days.\n\nTo relieve discomfort or pain in your abdomen:\n\n*   Apply a heating pad set on low or a hot water bottle filled with warm water on your abdomen to help ease discomfort.\n*   Take over-the-counter painkillers as instructed.\n\nFollow these activity guidelines after your procedure:\n\n*   Rest as needed.\n*   Do not do any vigorous activity for a few days. Light housework is fine.\n*   Avoid sexual intercourse for 2 to 3 weeks.\n*   A normal menstrual period should occur in about 4 to 6 weeks.\n\nYou can get pregnant before your next period. Be sure to make arrangements to prevent pregnancy, particularly during the first month after the abortion.\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nMedication abortions are safe and effective.

They may also perform imaging tests, such as X-rays or CT scans, to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for an abscess usually involves draining the pus with a needle or surgically removing it. Antibiotics may be prescribed to treat any underlying bacterial infection. In some cases, hospitalization may be necessary to monitor and manage symptoms.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Related Health Topics**\n\n*   Abscess\n*   Bacterial infections\n*   Dental problems\n*   Internal organ infections",

Oxygen-poor blood flows through this valve from the heart to the lungs, where it picks up fresh oxygen. This condition is present at birth (congenital).\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Causes**\n\nAbsent pulmonary valve occurs when the pulmonary valve does not form or develop properly while the baby is in the mother's womb. When present, it often occurs as part of a heart condition called tetralogy of Fallot. It is found in about 3% to 6% of people who have tetralogy of Fallot.\n\nWhen the pulmonary valve is missing or does not work well, blood does not flow efficiently to the lungs to get enough oxygen.\n\nIn most cases, there is also a hole between the left and right ventricles of the heart (ventricular septal defect). This defect will also lead to low-oxygen blood being pumped out to the body.\n\nThe skin will have a blue appearance (cyanosis), because the body's blood contains a low amount of oxygen.\n\nAbsent pulmonary valve also results in very enlarged (dilated) branch pulmonary arteries (the arteries that carry blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen). They can become so enlarged that they press on the tubes that bring the oxygen into the lungs (bronchi). This causes breathing problems.\n\n* Other heart defects that can occur with absent pulmonary valve include:\n\t+ Abnormal tricuspid valve\n\t+ Atrial septal defect\n\t+ Double outlet right ventricle\n\t+ Ductus arteriosis\n\t+ Endocardial cushion defect\n\t+ Marfan syndrome\n\t+ Tricuspid atresia\n\t+ Absent left pulmonary artery\n\nHeart problems that occur with absent pulmonary valve may be due to defects in certain genes.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nSymptoms can vary depending on which other defects the infant has, but may include:\n\n* Blue coloring to the skin (cyanosis)\n* Coughing\n* Failure to thrive\n* Poor appetite\n* Rapid breathing\n* Respiratory failure\n* Wheezing\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Exams and Tests**\n\nAbsent pulmonary valve may be diagnosed before the baby is born with a test that uses sound waves to create an image of the heart (echocardiogram).\n\nDuring an exam, the health care provider may hear a murmur in the infant's chest.\n\nTests for absent pulmonary valve include:\n\n* Heart CT scan\n* Chest x-ray\n* Echocardiogram\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG) test to measure the electrical activity of the heart\n* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Treatment**\n\nInfants who have respiratory symptoms typically need surgery early. Infants without severe symptoms most often have surgery within the first 3 to 6 months of life or later.\n\nDepending on the type of other heart defects the infant has, surgery may involve:\n\n* Closing the hole in the wall between the left and right ventricles of the heart (ventricular septal defect)\n* Closing a blood vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery (ductus arteriosis)\n* Enlarging the flow from the right ventricle to the lungs\n\nTypes of surgery for absent pulmonary valve include:\n\n* Moving the pulmonary artery to the front of the aorta and away from the airways\n* Rebuilding the artery wall in the lungs to reduce pressure on the airways (pulmonary plication and reduction arterioplasty)\n* Rebuilding the windpipe and breathing tubes to the lungs\n* Replacing the abnormal pulmonary valve with one taken from human or animal tissue\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Outlook (Prognosis)**\n\nWithout surgery, there may be a risk for serious consequences.\n\nIn many cases, surgery can treat the condition and relieve symptoms. Outcomes are most often very good.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Possible Complications**\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Brain infection (abscess)\n* Lung collapse (atelectasis)\n* Pneumonia\n* Right-sided heart failure\n* Stroke\n\n---\n\n**Absent Pulmonary Valve**\n\nAbsent pulmonary valve is a rare congenital heart defect in which the pulmonary valve is either missing or poorly formed.

However, it may be associated with other genetic syndromes or conditions that affect the development of the heart.\n\nFamilies with a history of congenital defects may be at higher risk for this condition.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nAbsent pulmonary valve can cause symptoms such as:\n\n* Shortness of breath\n* Fatigue\n* Swelling in the legs and feet\n* Blue discoloration of the skin (cyanosis)\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis is typically made through physical examination, chest X-ray, and echocardiogram.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no cure for absent pulmonary valve. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. This may include:\n\n* Medications to control heart rate and blood pressure\n* Oxygen therapy to improve oxygen levels in the blood\n* Surgery to repair or replace the pulmonary valve\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with absent pulmonary valve varies depending on the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment.\n\n**References**\n\n* Bernstein D.
