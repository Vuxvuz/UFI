Should we keep going through each section and discussing its pros and cons, or is there something more we should be focusing on?\n\nThe text mentions several articles and resources that might be helpful for navigating the world of love and relationships. Have you read any of them? Do they offer any insights or advice that might be relevant to our discussion?\n\nI'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed by all this information. Can we try to summarize the main points and see if there's a clearer takeaway message?\n\nLet's focus on the **Conclusion** section:\n\n*   Dating can be challenging, but it's also an opportunity for growth and self-discovery.\n*   Be patient and kind to yourself.\n*   Focus on building meaningful connections rather than trying",

    "content": "**Why a Therapeutic Alliance Is Important in Therapy**\n\nThe therapeutic alliance between a therapist and client is essential for successful treatment outcomes.\n\n*   Create a non-judgmental, supportive environment for clients.\n*   Set clear boundaries, provide feedback in an empathetic manner, and actively listen to what the client has to say.\n*   Focus on four key elements of the therapeutic alliance: positive rapport, mutual agreement on goals, realistic expectations, and sharing responsibility.\n\n**What are Four Key Elements of the Therapeutic Alliance?**\n\n1.  Positive Rapport\n2.  Mutual Agreement on Goals\n3.  Realistic Expectations\n4.  Sharing Responsibility\n\nThese four key elements help establish trust, encourage collaboration, and reinforce realistic expectations that enable clients to achieve their therapy goals.\n\n**What Are 5 Types of Therapeutic Alliances?**\n\n1.  Directive Alliance: The therapist takes an active role by providing instructions and feedback.\n2.  Nondirective Alliance: The therapist takes a passive role and allows the client to explore their own solutions.\n3.  Facilitative Alliance: Exploring feelings, thoughts, and emotions for personal growth.\n4.  Supportive Alliance: Providing emotional support and comfort while guiding as needed.\n5.  Task-Oriented Alliance: Helping clients attain specific goals or acquire new skills through practical activities.\n\n**What Are the Five Components of the Therapeutic Relationship?**\n\n1.  Mutual Respect\n2.  Empathy\n3.  Genuineness\n4.  Safety\n5.  Positive Expectations\n\nThese components help create a strong therapeutic bond that encourages meaningful change.\n\n**Impact of a Therapeutic Alliance**\n\nA strong therapeutic alliance helps determine how well clients respond to treatment and how likely they are to make positive changes that last beyond therapy.\n\n**Measuring the Therapeutic Alliance**\n\nThere are numerous tools available to assess the strength of the therapeutic bond, such as The Working Alliance Inventory.\n\n**How Therapists Can Strengthen the Therapeutic Alliance**\n\nTherapists can strengthen the therapeutic alliance by:\n\n1.  Showing genuine interest in their client's experiences.\n2.  Building trust through transparency and open communication.\n3.  Setting mutual goals.\n4.  Providing emotional support and practical guidance.\n5.  Being open to feedback from clients.\n\nBy taking these steps, therapists can build a strong therapeutic alliance with their clients that promotes meaningful change and healthy outcomes.

    "title": "How Behavioral Therapy Works",
    "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-behavioral-therapy-2795998",
    "content": "on Article\n\n**How Behavioral Therapy Works**\n\nBehavioral therapy is an action-based approach that focuses on changing maladaptive behaviors by reinforcing desirable ones and eliminating unwanted ones.\n\n**Types of Behavioral Therapy**\n\n1.  Applied behavior analysis (ABA) uses operant conditioning to shape and modify problematic behaviors.\n2.  Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) adds a cognitive element, focusing on the thoughts behind behaviors.\n3.  Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) combines CBT with mindfulness techniques to manage emotions and improve relationships.\n4.  Exposure therapy helps people overcome phobias by gradually exposing them to feared situations or objects.\n5.  Rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) focuses on identifying and challenging negative thoughts.\n\n**Behavioral Therapy Techniques**\n\n1.  Classical conditioning involves forming associations between stimuli, such as pairing an undesirable behavior with an aversive stimulus.\n2.  Operant conditioning uses reinforcement and punishment to increase or decrease the frequency of a behavior.\n3.  Contingency management uses contracts to outline behavior-change goals and rewards.\n4.  Extinction removes reinforcement to eliminate unwanted behavior.\n5.  Behavior modeling involves learning through observation and imitation.\n\n**What Behavioral Therapy Can Help With**\n\n1.  Anxiety disorders\n2.  Bipolar disorder\n3.  Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n4.  Autism spectrum disorders\n5.  Borderline personality disorder (BPD)\n6.  Depression\n7.  Eating disorders\n8.  Panic disorder\n9.  Phobias\n10. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)\n\n**Benefits of Behavioral Therapy**\n\n1.  Effective in treating a range of conditions, including anxiety and depression.\n2.  Can be more affordable than other forms of therapy.\n3.  Results are often seen in five to 20 sessions.\n4.  Can help with communication, coping strategies, and self-esteem.\n\n**Effectiveness of Behavioral Therapy**\n\n1.  Approximately 67% of people who try psychotherapy experience some positive improvement.\n2.  CBT is effective for treating anxiety disorders, including PTSD and OCD.\n3.  However, its effectiveness can vary depending on the condition being treated.\n\n**Things to Consider**\n\n1.  Behavioral therapy may not be enough for complex mental health conditions.\n2.  It may not address underlying problems or situations contributing to a mental health issue.\n3.  It is essential to find a qualified behavioral therapist and participate actively in treatment.\n\n**How to Get Started**\n\n1.  Find a behavioral therapist, such as a counselor, psychologist, psychiatrist, or social worker.\n2.  Ask for recommendations from your primary care physician or insurance provider.\n3.  Set clear goals with your therapist to create an effective treatment plan.\n4.  Be committed to participating in the process and working towards change.",

It isn't until adolescence, or ages 12 to 18, that kids and teens are able to do more complex thinking such as considering abstract concepts, reasoning new ideas from known principles, and considering many points of view.1 The adult brain isn't fully developed until 25 years old.2\n\nThe fact that children's brains are so different from adult brains means the way that children experience emotion, process their experiences, and communicate their needs will be different than how adults do these things.\n\n**Play Therapy for Young Children**\n\nYounger kids especially often process emotion through play, and play therapists utilize games and toys in their sessions to facilitate this. It can look to parents like their child is just playing in their sessions, when in fact the therapist is creating space for this important emotional work to occur.3\n\nChildren often feel safer opening up emotionally when they are engaged in play. In addition, children often act out real-life scenarios through play, which provides a lot of information to the therapist about what the child is coping with.\n\n**Talk Therapy**\n\nTeenagers might engage in talk therapy but spend much of their session discussing things that the parent might not think is relevant to their presenting issues. What your teen feels is important to cover in therapy might not perfectly line up with your perception. Since rapport is a key element of therapeutic change, discussions that do not seem to relate to your teen's symptoms are still an important part of their treatment.5\n\nEven though the parent or legal guardian has to sign off in order for the child to participate in therapy, this does not mean that you will have access to all of the information from your child's sessions. While you will have access to their medical records, the Privacy Rule under HIPAA states that, with a few exceptions, parents don't always have rights to receive a mental health professional's notes that are taken during sessions with their child.6\n\n**Mandated Reporting**\n\nYou, your child, and the therapist should discuss limits to confidentiality early in treatment to ensure that everyone understands and is on the same page about privacy in sessions.\n\nShould your child disclose something that makes the therapist concerned for their safety, the therapist will have to follow your state's applicable mandated reporting laws. The therapist might let you know that they had to contact Child Protective Services about a disclosure, but if they are concerned that this disclosure would put your child at risk, they might not share this information with you.8\n\n**Signs Your Child Might Benefit from Therapy**\n\nThere is no minimum threshold for someone to need or deserve support. If your child states that they think they need therapy, take their concerns seriously. However, the following signs might indicate that they may benefit from mental health treatment:\n\n1. There has been significant change in their mood. If your child has become withdrawn, fearful, or moody, this might indicate that they are having a hard time and could benefit from talking to a therapist.\n2. Their behavior has changed. Has your child started getting into trouble at school, or have their grades shifted suddenly? This can be a red flag that they are struggling. Instead of punishing them for a change in behavior, help them explore what the cause might be.\n3. They have experienced a stressful or traumatic event. Trauma is relative, and different things impact people differently. If your child has experienced something stressful or traumatic, they may benefit from processing with a professional. Examples of traumatic events include childhood abuse, experiencing or witnessing domestic violence, bullying, and the death of a loved one.\n4. They have engaged in self-harm behavior. A person might engage in non-suicidal self-injury when their mental health is suffering. A therapist can help your child identify the underlying causes of this behavior and help them find more appropriate coping skills.\n5. They have expressed suicidal ideation. Though it can be distressing to think about, even children as young as four to six can experience suicidal thoughts and behaviors.9\n\n**Finding A Therapist For Your Child**\n\nIt can be difficult to find a therapist who specializes in your presenting concerns, has availability, is a good fit, and accepts your health insurance. When finding a therapist for your child, the following things are important to keep in mind:\n\n1. What are your child's specific concerns? Therapists can specialize in different areas, so look for someone whose expertise includes your child's needs.\n2. Who does your child want to see? It can be tempting to choose a therapist based on your preferences, but remember that they are there to treat your child. The child's preferences and needs should take priority in choosing a therapist.\n3. Can your child develop good rapport with this therapist? You might have to try more than one therapist before your child meets one with whom they feel safe and comfortable.\n\n**Do You Need Therapy, Too?**\n\nAlthough they do not always show it, children are very in tune with the emotions of the adults around them. Often, a child will engage in acting out behaviors in response to things they have experienced or even unspoken feelings they pick up on from their parents. Stressors that impact your child's mental health may likely be affecting you as well.\n\nMany mental health issues have a genetic component, and so if your child meets criteria for a diagnosis, it is possible that you are predisposed to something similar.10 Furthermore, parenting a child who is dealing with mental health issues can be stressful, and you deserve support for your own stress.\n\nBecause mental health stigma is pervasive, many adults are hesitant to seek therapy for their own issues. It is OK to get support and attend your own therapy. This can not only help you get the care that you need and deserve, but it normalizes getting mental health treatment. You can model for your child that it is OK to ask for help, and struggling with their mental health does not make them bad.\n\nGetting your own therapy can help you change how you approach parenting and how you interact with your child, breaking maladaptive or unhealthy patterns. If appropriate, you and your child can attend family therapy together to work on your relationship.

Sometimes, the best and most supportive thing you can do is seek support for your child or yourself.

You may have heard about a therapist from a friend or family member who had great experiences with them. However, it's essential to remember that the same therapist who worked well for your friend might not be the best fit for you.\n\n### **Why Finding the Right Therapist Matters**\n\nA good therapeutic relationship can make all the difference in therapy. Research has shown that the quality of the relationship between a patient and their therapist is more important than the type of treatment used.1\n\n### **What to Consider When Choosing a Therapist**\n\nWhen looking for a therapist, consider factors such as:\n\n*   Gender: Do you feel more comfortable with a man, woman, or nonbinary person?\n*   Age: Do you want to work with someone older, younger, or around your age?\n*   Religion: Does it matter if the therapist has a particular religious affiliation?\n\n### **Where to Find a Therapist**\n\nYou can start your search by:\n\n*   Checking with your health insurance provider for a directory of therapists who accept your insurance\n*   Asking friends and family members for recommendations\n*   Reaching out to mental health organizations or online directories\n\n### **What to Ask a Therapist Before You Meet**\n\nDuring a consultation, consider asking questions such as:\n\n*   How do you conduct therapy sessions?\n*   What types of treatments do you use?\n*   How will we work together to achieve your goals?\n\n### **What to Expect During Your First Appointment**\n\nYour first appointment may involve discussing your problems or symptoms, setting goals for treatment, and answering questions about your childhood, medical history, and past mental health treatment.\n\n### **Changing Therapists**\n\nIf you don't feel a connection with your therapist or if you're not seeing progress towards your goals, it's okay to change therapists. You can talk to your current therapist about your concerns or ask for a referral to someone else.\n\nIn conclusion, finding the right therapist is crucial for effective therapy. By considering factors such as gender, age, and religion, searching in reputable directories, asking questions during consultations, and being open to changing therapists if needed, you can find a therapist who is a good fit for you.\n\n---\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

And, based on our interview with her, we quickly noticed Dr. Joy's warm and welcoming presence, and it became easy to see why she's so extraordinary at what she does.\n\n**Why Dr. Joy Became a Therapist**\n\nDr. Joy learned that therapy was what she wanted to do because she liked knowing that she could make a difference in someone's life. Therapy Was a Calling\n\n1.  I had an opportunity to take a psychology class in high school ... and I fell in love with the subject matter and knew I wanted to major in that once I got to college, starts Dr. Joy.\n\n**The Therapy for Black Girls Directory Connects Black People to Black Therapists**\n\nTherapeutic rapport is a significant factor in determining the success of treatment. In other words, the relationship that someone has with their therapist can make all the difference. And, for people of color, finding a therapist who not only understands their mental health needs but also understands how their culture plays a role in how they perceive mental health can be difficult.\n\n*   According to the American Psychological Association, 83% of mental health professionals are White and the remaining 17% are of color.\n*   Dr. Joy sheds light on the value of Black clients seeing therapists of color.\n\n**Aims to Repair Broken Hearts**\n\nDr. Joy's practice focuses on providing relationship therapy. I work with clients very relationally, there's a lot of things that you don't know about yourself until you're in a relationship with someone, says Dr. Joy.\n\n*   Considering her experience helping college students deal with their relationships, she felt that going on to specialize in relationship therapy felt like a natural transition.\n*   Black and interracial friendships can be a safe space for mental health.\n\n**Using Pop Culture to Help People Heal**\n\nDr. Joy (whose Twitter tagline is You can find me at the intersection of psychology and pop culture ) is known for referencing trending movies and series to jumpstart conversations about relationship issues.\n\n*   In her podcast, for instance, Dr. Joy has covered everything from Issa's painful breakup with Lawrence as a result of her infidelity in HBO's Insecure and Carlton and Will's complex dynamic in Peacock's Bel-Air.\n*   People may cheat for different reasons.\n*   And many of us may say that we have a love-hate relationship with at least one (or all) of our family members.\n\n**Moving Away From 'The Superwoman Schema'**\n\nA far-too-frequent role that Black women willingly and reluctantly take on is that of the superwoman. It's a good thing for us to recognize that we've been running ourselves into the ground and not really taking good care of ourselves in the interest of taking care of so many other people.\n\n*   Dr. Cheryl Woods-Giscombe was the first to put a name to this concept-the Superwoman Schema (SWS).\n*   Black women are taught to be resilient, self-sacrificial, and independent.\n*   Taking care of their own needs and mental health is typically last on their to-do lists-if it even appears on the list at all.\n\n**What's Next for Dr. Joy?**\n\nConsidering Dr. Joy's support for group healing, she's written a book about how sisterhood can help Black women heal from trauma and heartbreak. Her debut book, Sisterhood Heals: The Transformative Power of Healing in Community, will be released on June 27, 2023.\n\n*   Dr. Joy is helping Black women heal from heartbreak and trauma.\n*   Read More: THERAPY\n\n**Fun Facts About Dr. Joy**\n\nWhat does Dr. Joy do for self-care?: Aside from taking a lot of naps, Dr. Joy loves to hula hoop.\n\nDoes Dr. Joy see a therapist?: Absolutely, every Tuesday at 2:15!\n\nThe piece of mental advice Dr. Joy wishes she learned sooner: Recognizing how much sleep impacts her mental health\n\nHer hope for the Black community: I'd like to see more group therapy and that's a personal aim of mine.\n\nOn how it feels to be recognized for her work: We have made an incredible impact [with the] work that we do at Therapy for Black Girls. So, it always feels nice to have other people recognize that. Recognition like this allows more people to find out about it, which is the best part. I'm very excited about it.

The American Psychological Association notes that most therapists in the United States are White, with only 17% being people of color.\n2. Dr. Joy believes that having a shared cultural experience can help build trust between clients and their therapists, especially for Black women who may feel more comfortable discussing sensitive topics with someone who understands their perspective.\n3. The Superwoman Schema (SWS) is a concept developed by Dr. Cheryl Woods-Giscombe to describe the numerous roles Black women are expected to take on, including wife, mother, nurturer, and breadwinner.\n4. Dr. Joy acknowledges that while it's essential for Black women to prioritize their self-care needs, cutting off everyone and focusing solely on oneself can be unhealthy and may not be sustainable in the long term.\n5. Dr. Joy hopes to see more group therapy in the Black community, as she believes it can provide a safe space for people to support one another and work through challenges together.\n\nThis article provides an overview of Dr. Joy Harden Bradford's background, her journey to becoming a therapist, and her work with Therapy for Black Girls. It also highlights her commitment to helping Black women build healthy relationships and heal from heartbreak and trauma. The article mentions Dr. Joy's use of pop culture references to facilitate discussions about relationship issues and her efforts to promote group therapy as a means of supporting the mental health needs of Black people.\n\nSome of the key points mentioned in the article include:\n\n*   Dr. Joy's passion for helping Black women heal from heartbreak and trauma\n*   Her use of pop culture references to facilitate discussions about relationship issues\n*   The importance of cultural safety in mental healthcare, particularly for Black clients\n*   The Superwoman Schema (SWS) concept developed by Dr. Cheryl Woods-Giscombe\n*   Dr. Joy's hope for more group therapy in the Black community\n\nOverall, this article provides a comprehensive overview of Dr. Joy Harden Bradford's work and her commitment to promoting mental health and wellness among Black women.

It takes courage to be willing to share your deepest feelings with a mental health professional. In therapy, it is completely normal to experience fears of judgment or hesitation to share intimate details of your life.\n\nIn turn, you may feel uneasy at the thought of telling your therapist everything or may wonder how much information is too much information. This article will explain if you should tell your therapist everything and why.\n\n**Reasons Why You Can't Open Up**\n\nYou might be hesitant to open up to your therapist because:\n\n*   Shame: Feeling shame can lead to withdrawing from therapy psychologically and even physically.\n*   Reluctance: It's normal to feel hesitation when sharing details about your life with someone that you don't know that well.\n*   Embarrassment: Maybe you overreacted to something in your personal life and you feel embarrassed to share that with your therapist.\n*   Anger: Maybe you are upset about something your therapist said and want to tell them how you feel.\n*   Fear: It's also possible that you're scared to share things about your life.\n\n**Confidentiality**\n\nWhile therapists are required to keep your personal matters confidential, it is important to remember that there are times when your therapist must break confidentiality for legal and ethical reasons and tell a third party about content shared in your session.\n\nA therapist will break confidentiality only under emergency circumstances:\n\n1.  You have an intent to harm yourself or others.\n2.  You share information about current child abuse, elder abuse, or abuse of disabled people.\n3.  Your therapist receives a court order (this occurs in instances where the patient is involved in a legal case and their mental health needs to be evaluated).\n\n**What to Do If You Don't Trust Your Therapist**\n\nFeeling distrust in the therapeutic relationship can stem from multiple sources.\n\nIf you don't trust your therapist, let them know how you're feeling. Sometimes we are grappling with our own challenges around trust, which a therapist can help you through if you're honest with them. Other times, it's possible that you and your therapist are simply not the right fit.\n\n**Finding a New Therapist**\n\nIf you find yourself realizing that you cannot be candid with your therapist because it isn't a good match, you may be wondering how you can find a new therapist.\n\nTo start your search for a new therapist, you can:\n\n*   Ask for referrals\n*   Check online therapy directories\n*   Try an online therapy service\n\n**Questions to Ask a New Therapist**\n\nWhen interviewing a new therapist, ask questions like:\n\n1.  What is their experience working with clients who have concerns similar to yours?\n2.  How do they approach confidentiality and maintaining a safe therapeutic environment?\n3.  Can you describe your therapeutic approach and how it might benefit me?\n\n**A Word From Verywell**\n\nIt can take time to find a therapist that is a good fit and get comfortable in the therapeutic relationship. While navigating your healing journey, honesty with yourself and your therapist is key.\n\nIf you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor.

    "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/what-you-should-know-about-kleptomania-4137660",
    "content": "Table of Contents Signs and Symptoms What Else Could It Be? Causes Prevalence Diagnosis Treatment\n\n**What Is Kleptomania?**\n\nKleptomania is a condition characterized by an irresistible urge to steal. People with kleptomania will steal items that they do not need, that they could afford to buy, or that have little to no monetary value.\n\n*   Stealing results in feelings of gratification, relief, and even pleasure.\n*   Feelings of guilt and remorse following the crime are common.\n*   Kleptomania does not involve theft for personal gain.\n*   The items themselves may hold little to no monetary value.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nA repeated failure to resist the impulse to steal\nStealing items of no value or that one does not need\nFeelings of relief or pleasure during the theft\n\n**What Else Could It Be?**\n\nKleptomania can occur alongside other conditions, including:\n*   Mood disorders\n*   Panic disorder\n*   Separation anxiety disorder\n*   Body dysmophic disorder\n*   Obsessive compulsive disorder\n*   Other impulse control disorders\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact causes of kleptomania are not well understood. Possible explanations include:\n\n1.  The Psychoanalytic Approach: Stealing as a way to symbolically compensate for an early loss or neglect.\n2.  The Cognitive-Behavioral Approach: Stealing as a learned behavior, reinforced by positive consequences.\n3.  The Biological Approach: Stealing linked to brain dysfunction and neurotransmitter imbalances.\n\n**Prevalence**\n\nKleptomania is thought to be relatively rare, with estimates suggesting a lifetime prevalence of between 0.3 to 0.6% of the population.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis typically involves:\n\n*   Patient interviews\n*   Review of legal records\n*   Administering psychometric scales such as the Kleptomania Symptoms Assessment Scale (K-SAS) or the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, Modified for Kleptomania (K-YBOCS)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nCommon treatments include:\n\n1.  Medications: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as well as other antidepressants.\n2.  Psychotherapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy targets both the thoughts and behaviors that contribute to stealing.\n\nEarly intervention and effective treatment are crucial in helping individuals with kleptomania manage their symptoms and avoid legal consequences. Treatment may also involve addressing co-occurring conditions, such as substance use disorders or anxiety disorders. If you suspect that you or someone you know has kleptomania, consult a mental health professional for proper evaluation and treatment.  [1]. Internal tension builds before the theft and is relieved by committing the theft. Individuals with kleptomania may be in public settings when they experience the urge to steal, which can lead to legal consequences such as arrest and incarceration. The secretive nature of the disorder and associated feelings of guilt and shame can interfere with diagnosis and treatment. It's estimated that between 3.8% and 24% of shoplifters have symptoms consistent with kleptomania, making it a relatively rare condition. Diagnosis may involve patient interviews, review of legal records, and administering psychometric scales such as the Kleptomania Symptoms Assessment Scale (K-SAS) or the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, Modified for Kleptomania (K-YBOCS). Effective treatment involves using medications like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. Early intervention and addressing co-occurring conditions are crucial in managing symptoms and avoiding legal consequences. If you suspect that you or someone you know has kleptomania, consult a mental health professional for proper evaluation and treatment.  [2]. The secretive nature of the disorder makes it difficult to determine the prevalence of kleptomania.
