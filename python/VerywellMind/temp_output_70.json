It can also foster self-reflection and personal growth.\n\nSome of the benefits include:\n\n*   Improved personal exploration\n*   Increased creativity\n*   More social energy\n\nImproved Personal Exploration\n-----------------------------\n\nBecoming comfortable in your own company can give you the time and freedom to truly explore your own passions without interference.\n\nIt can be a way to explore new things, research topics that interest you, gain knowledge, and even practice new forms of self-expression.\n\nTaking some time for yourself allows you to explore these aspects free from the pressures and judgments of others.\n\nIncreased Creativity\n--------------------\n\nAlone time is an opportunity to let your mind wander and strengthen your creativity.\n\nWithout the need to care for or interact with other people, you can ignore outside influences and focus inward.\n\nResearch actually suggests that being alone can lead to changes in the brain that help fuel the creative process.\n\nMore Social Energy\n-----------------\n\nLiving alone is often portrayed in a negative light. However, researchers have found that people who live alone may actually have richer social lives and more social energy than people who cohabitate with others.\n\nChallenges\n==========\n\nSolitude can be challenging for some people for a variety of reasons.\n\nSome research found that many people would prefer to give themselves painful electric shocks rather than sit alone with their own thoughts.\n\nSome of these reasons people might struggle with being alone include:\n\n*   Lack of experience being alone: Some people might not be used to being alone because they are so accustomed to being around other people.\n*   Distressing thoughts and feelings: In other cases, being alone and focusing inward can be difficult or even painful.\n*   Social stigma: Stigma about being alone can also shape how people feel about solitude.\n\nPersonality and Alone Time\n-------------------------\n\nAspects of your personality, as well as your individual preferences, can play a role in determining how much alone time you need and how beneficial it may be.\n\nExtroverts tend to feel energized by social experiences, for example, which means that solitude might be more challenging for them.\n\nHowever, don't think that just because you are an extrovert you won't enjoy spending time by yourself.\n\nIn one study, social psychologist Thuy-vy Thi Nguyen found that introverts and extroverts didn't actually differ in how much enjoyment they gained from solitude.\n\nAloneness vs. Loneliness\n------------------------\n\nEven before the global pandemic, experts warned that a loneliness epidemic was threatening the wellness of people of all ages.\n\nResearch suggests that people experience more loneliness now than they have in the past.\n\nHowever, being alone doesn't equal loneliness.\n\nWhere loneliness is marked by negative feelings associated with isolation, alone time involves finding freedom, inspiration, and rejuvenation in solitude.\n\nSigns You Need It\n-----------------\n\nRecognizing when you need time away from others isn't always easy.\n\nSome signs to watch for include:\n\n*   Feeling short-tempered\n*   Getting easily irritated by sometimes minor things\n*   Losing interest in doing things with other people\n*   Feeling overwhelmed or overstimulated\n*   Having trouble concentrating\n*   Getting anxious about spending time with other people\n\nWays to Get It\n-----------------\n\nIf you're craving some time to yourself, it is crucial to do so in ways that support your mental well-being.\n\nBeing alone is most beneficial when it is voluntary.\n\nFeeling like you can return to your social world whenever you like is also essential.\n\nSome steps to take include:\n\n*   Be clear: Tell the people around you, whether they are roommates, family members, or your partner, that you need time alone.\n*   Be specific: Let people know what this means. For example, you might say that you need a certain amount of uninterrupted time to read a book, watch a television show, or listen to a podcast.\n*   Return the favor: If people are willing to take steps to ensure that you get some alone time, it is important for you to show them the same consideration. Offer to take on some responsibilities while they have some space to themselves.\n\nGetting Others to Respect It\n------------------------------\n\nFinding time to be alone isn't always easy.\n\nThose around you may have different social needs and may not understand your need for solitude.\n\nFamily obligations and parenting responsibilities can also make it tough to carve out time for yourself.\n\nSome steps that you can take include:\n\n*   Be clear: Tell the people around you, whether they are roommates, family members, or your partner, that you need time alone.\n*   Be specific: Let people know what this means. For example, you might say that you need a certain amount of uninterrupted time to read a book, watch a television show, or listen to a podcast.\n*   Return the favor: If people are willing to take steps to ensure that you get some alone time, it is important for you to show them the same consideration. Offer to take on some responsibilities while they have some space to themselves.\n\nTips to Overcome a Fear of Alone Time\n----------------------------------------\n\nIf the thought of being alone makes you fear you'll feel lonely, research suggests that reframing time spent alone as solitude may be helpful.\n\nIn one study, participants were assigned to read about the prevalence of loneliness, a passage about the benefits of solitude, or an unrelated topic.\n\nAfter completing this reading, the participants sat alone for 10 minutes. In each condition, people experienced decreases in both negative and positive feelings.\n\nSuch results suggest that while being alone might not always boost your mood, it can help you better regulate your emotions. \n\nThe study also found that while people who read about the benefits of solitude didn't necessarily experience a better mood, they didn't experience the same reduction of positive feelings as those in the other two groups.\n\nSuch findings suggest that reassessing how you look at spending time alone can play an important role in moderating the potentially negative effects of loneliness.

    "content": "**LIVING WELL Understanding Emotions**\n\nWhile we are all wired differently, our emotions-and the ways in which we feel and respond to the world around us-make us unique. They allow us to realize what's most important to us, from the people we care about to the opinions we hold, and force us to navigate the complexities of everyday life. They may also give us a glimpse into patterns stemming from our childhood experiences.\n\n**The 6 Types of Basic Emotions and Their Effect on Human Behavior**\n\nEmotions and types of emotional responses are complex and multifaceted. Understanding these concepts can help you better navigate your relationships, make informed decisions, and cultivate healthy coping mechanisms.\n\n*   Learn where emotions originate\n*   Discover how they affect our lives and behaviors\n*   Understand why they manifest in the ways that they do\n\n**Emotions and Types of Emotional Responses**\n\nEmotions are influenced by a network of interconnected structures in the brain that make up what is known as the limbic system. Key structures including the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the limbic cortex play a pivotal role in emotions and behavioral responses.\n\n**The Important Role of Emotions**\n\nEmotions are essential for our well-being and success. They help us navigate complex situations, make informed decisions, and form meaningful connections with others.

Key structures including the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the limbic cortex play a pivotal role in emotions and behavioral responses.\n\n**Can we control our emotions?**\n\nAs human beings, we have the ability to self-regulate, or manage our thoughts, behaviors, and emotions-allowing us to better handle stress, deal with conflict, and accomplish our goals. We can continue to develop our self-regulation skills through mindfulness strategies and exercises.\n\n**KEY TERMS**\n\n*   **Emotional Intelligence**: The ability to perceive, control, and evaluate emotions.\n*   **Emotion Wheel**: An emotion classification system introduced by psychologist Robert Plutchik in the 1980s.\n*   **Expression**: The act of communicating our thoughts and emotions with others, verbally or non-verbally.\n*   **Mood**: A relatively stable affective state that is often described as positive or negative.\n\n**EXPLORE UNDERSTANDING EMOTIONS**\n\nThis section features a curated list of articles and resources to help you better understand emotions and develop healthy coping mechanisms.

    "content": "**I Tried Lion's Mane for a Month-Here's What It Did for My Mental Health**\n\nWhile research is ongoing, the results sound promising.\n\nBy Ariane Resnick, CNC\n\nPublished on March 15, 2025\n\nMedically reviewed by Alicia Bigelow, ND\n\nGanna STRYZHEKIN Getty Images\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n*   Potential Benefits of Lion's Mane\n*   Taking Lion's Mane Daily\n*   Should You Take Lion's Mane for Energy and Mood?\n*   Disclaimer\n*   The Risks\n*   Takeaway\n*   Read More: LIVING WELL SELF-IMPROVEMENT 5 Sources\n\n**Potential Benefits of Lion's Mane**\n\nThis odd-looking mushroom has benefits for nearly every part of the body. So far, a surprising amount of studies have been done about this category of supplement, with some excellent results, but it's worth noting that research is still ongoing.\n\n*   Can Help With Immunity\n*   May Improve Energy\n*   Reduce Stress\n*   Improved Cognition\n\n**Taking Lion's Mane Daily**\n\nNow that I was fully jazzed for everything lion's mane could help with, I switched over from my usual mushroom combo, which I had taken consistently for about three years, and started taking lion's mane extract instead.\n\n1.  Week 1: \n    *   The first week of taking lion's mane went smoothly.\n    *   I began to notice that my afternoon slumps were feeling decidedly less slumpy.\n\n2.  Week 2:\n    *   Ever since entering perimenopause, my PMS week has had intense symptoms, one of which is brain fog. \n    *   The lion's mane alone was not cutting it for me cognitively.\n    *   I started noticing that I was feeling scattered, so about halfway through the week, I added my usual powder back in.\n    *   The cognitive issues disappeared within a day.\n\n3.  Week 3:\n    *   The addition of lion's mane to my daily 'shroom fix continued to help my energy improve.\n    *   My afternoons felt weirdly normal, and I experienced as much energy as I had most mornings, which hasn't happened to me for years.\n    *   I found myself more motivated to do things I'm generally too exhausted to even contemplate.\n\n4.  Week 4:\n    *   During the fourth week of taking lion's mane, a good friend of mine got a cold.\n    *   We had spent time together in close physical proximity the week before she got sick.\n    *   I didn't catch her cold, and it made me realize I haven't gotten sick yet this season.\n\n**Should You Take Lion's Mane for Energy and Mood?**\n\nDisclaimer\n\nAs with any other supplements, be sure to first check with your healthcare provider to see if lion's mane is right for you. Many people can benefit from this mushroom, but don't expect to notice a huge difference right away, whether you have a history of taking them or not.\n\nWright notes that benefits may take up to a few weeks to be noticeable, so be patient and consistent with supplementation. To make sure they're working out for you, she suggests,\n\n*   When you start taking lion's mane, keep track of any changes in mood, cognition, digestion, energy, or allergies.\n\n**The Risks**\n\nLion's mane has perks, including the potential to perk you up, but they aren't suitable for absolutely everyone. As you could guess, people who are allergic to mushrooms are not candidates for taking them in a supplement and or medicinal manner. They are also a potential conflict for people who have blood sugar issues.\n\nWatch for symptoms of hypoglycemia, as lion's mane can impact blood sugar levels, says Guan. To prevent that, she recommends that you start with the lowest dose and increase it as long as it is well tolerated.\n\nAccordingly, this supplement should be avoided by anyone with diabetes, especially those who take medication for it. Wright tells us to also avoid lion's mane if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, if you take blood thinning meds-they can have a blood thinning effect and could increase your risk of bleeding-or if you take immunosuppressive drugs as they stimulate the immune system.\n\n**Takeaway**\n\nI didn't really expect to notice anything by taking lion's mane alone because I had already been using it in a small dose, so I was very pleasantly surprised by my experience with it. If you haven't delved into the world of mushrooms before, and you don't have any of the contraindications listed above, I'd highly suggest an extract like this one to start.\n\nMissing out on the funky, dirt-like taste is a big step up from whisking a clump of powder into your morning beverage! Lion's mane could potentially help with your immunity, cognition, mood, and more, so it might be worth a try. \n\n**Read More: LIVING WELL SELF-IMPROVEMENT 5 Sources**\n\nBy Ariane Resnick, CNC\n\nAriane Resnick, CNC is a mental health writer, certified nutritionist, and wellness author who advocates for accessibility and inclusivity.

    "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/how-do-i-stop-feeling-like-im-behind-in-life-11729611",
    "content": "Share this article on Facebook Share this article on Twitter Share this article via email What does it mean to feel behind in life, and how can you overcome those feelings? Read more about it here.\n\n**Why It's So Easy to Feel Behind**\n\nFeeling behind in life can sneak up on you in all sorts of moments-while scrolling through social media, enjoying a dinner with family or friends, or even just lying awake at night wondering if you took a wrong turn somewhere. Humans are naturally inclined to compare themselves to others due to both evolutionary and social factors. Historically, comparison helped individuals assess their social standing, a crucial element for survival, says Carolina Casillas, PhD, LPC, a therapist at the Clinical Mental Health Counseling Faculty at University of Phoenix. In today's modern world, that comparison is amplified by societal pressures, but also through social media highlight reels. At any hour of the day, we're exposed to a carefully curated display of others' wins with little context for what else is going on in their life or the struggles they may have endured to find their own successes.\n\n**Common Areas People Feel Behind in Life**\n\n*   Career and professional life, like getting a raise, starting a business, earning an award, or getting a new job.\n*   Personal milestones, such as getting married, having a baby, or taking a fancy vacation.\n*   Financial stability, which can include investing, buying a house, or retiring.\n*   Education and achievements, such as earning a degree, going back to school, or developing a new skill.\n*   Social and family life, including making close friends, maintaining strong relationships, or feeling like you've found your people.\n*   Health and wellness, whether it's hitting fitness goals, dropping excess weight, healing from chronic illness, or sticking to a balanced lifestyle.\n*   Creative or personal growth, such as writing a book or pursuing a passion project.\n\n**How to Overcome Feelings Of 'Being Behind in Life'**\n\n1.  **Understand That Everyone Is On Their Own Path**: Comparison is often a knee-jerk reaction we experience when we see another person's wins. In these moments, you must remind yourself that there is no singular right timeline or journey to follow in life.\n2.  **Use Jealousy as a Tool**: Jealousy, while a very painful emotion to experience, can be an extremely valuable tool. It shows you what you want in life and also what's possible.\n3.  **Deeply Examine Your Feelings**: What you're feeling might seem like jealousy on the surface, but it's also worth asking if that's really what's going on. Sometimes, what we label as envy is actually grief over a missed opportunity, frustration from feeling stuck, or longing for a life that feels more aligned with who we are.\n4.  **Practice Self-Compassion**: It is essential that feelings of being behind in life are met with a sense of self-compassion versus self-criticism.\n5.  **Define and Prioritize Your Own Goals**: One of the fastest ways to feel like you're falling behind is by chasing goals that were never yours to begin with. Social expectations, family pressure, and curated glimpses into other people's lives can all blur the line between what you truly want and what you think you should want. That's why it's essential to pause and define success on your own terms. Redefine what 'having it together' means to you. Not in theory, but in practice, says Rudolph. Is it being financially stable enough to take a risk? Is it having a few people in your corner who really get you? Is it finding a new job? Once you've clarified what actually matters to you, you can start prioritizing your time and energy around those goals-rather than trying to keep pace with someone else's journey. There's real power in choosing intention over imitation.  \\[1] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7425113/. \\[2] https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33476194/. \\[3] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7492349/.

A person's genes and environment influence this condition, which is widely viewed as a brain disease due to its impact on the brain's reward, pleasure, and self-control circuits.\n\n**Understanding Addiction**\n\nAddiction can be understood in various ways:\n\n*   Can Tapering Off Alcohol Prevent Withdrawal?\n*   What Does It Mean to Be Sober Curious?\n*   Can Self-Improvement Feel Like Too Much of a Good Thing?\n\nThe symptoms used to diagnose substance use disorders are:\n\n1.  Taking the substance in larger amounts or over a longer period than intended.\n2.  A persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control substance use.\n3.  Spending a lot of time getting, using, or recovering from the effects of the substance.\n4.  Craving or a strong desire or urge to use the substance.\n5.  Recurrent substance use resulting in failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home.\n6.  Continued substance use despite having persistent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the substance.\n\n**Causes of Addiction**\n\nMultiple factors influence the process of addiction, including:\n\n*   Genetics\n*   Diet\n*   Mental health\n*   Past traumas\n*   Pain\n*   Stress\n*   Stage of life\n\n**Breaking an Addiction**\n\nThe first step in overcoming addiction is to desire change and avoid people, places, and things that promote the addiction. Support groups, mentors, and 12-step programs provide help, while counselors, recovery centers, and physicians provide expertise and medication to treat cravings and withdrawal symptoms.\n\nEating healthy and getting exercise also play an important role in recovery.\n\n**Is Addiction Genetic?**\n\nA person's genetics account for about half of their risk for developing an addiction. The impact of genetics is influenced by an interaction between a person's environment, diet, and biology. Alcoholism, like other addictions, tends to run in families, and members of those families are at increased risk for developing alcoholism.\n\n**Key Terms**\n\n*   Substance Use Disorder\n*   Behavioral Addiction\n*   Intervention\n*   Comorbidity\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n*   Is addiction a disease?\n*   What causes addiction?\n*   How can you break an addiction?\n*   Is addiction genetic?\n\n**Related Articles**\n\n*   What Is Addiction?

    "title": "What to Do When You Have No Motivation",

    "content": "on This Page Verywell Mind uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed articles, to support the facts in our articles. Read our editorial process to learn more about how we fact-check and keep our content accurate, reliable, and trustworthy.\n\n**What to Do When You Have No Motivation**\n\n**Act as If You Feel Motivated**\n\nWhen you're struggling with motivation, try to trick yourself into feeling motivated by changing your behavior. Act as if you felt motivated, and your actions may change your emotions. Get dressed and get moving instead of sitting on the couch in your pajamas all day waiting for motivation to strike.\n\n*   Ask yourself what you'd be doing right now if you felt motivated.\n*   Consider what you'd be wearing, how you'd be thinking, and what actions you'd be taking.\n*   Then do these things, and see if your motivation level increases.\n\n**Argue the Opposite**\n\nWhen you're struggling with motivation, you'll likely come up with a long list of reasons why you shouldn't take any action. Try arguing the opposite. When you think you're going to fail, argue all the reasons why you might succeed. Or when you think you can't finish a job, list all the evidence that shows you'll be able to complete the task.\n\n*   Arguing the opposite can help you see both ends of the spectrum.\n*   It can also remind you that an overly pessimistic outcome isn't completely accurate.\n*   There's a chance that things might work out better than you expect.\n\n**Practice Self-Compassion**\n\nYou might think being hard on yourself is the key to getting motivated. But harsh self-criticism doesn't work. Research shows that self-compassion is actually much more motivating, especially when you are struggling with adversity.\n\n*   Practice using self-talk that encourages you and helps you recover from setbacks.\n*   Coach yourself in a helpful manner.\n*   Speak to yourself like a trusted friend.\n\n**Use the 10-Minute Rule**\n\nWhen you dread doing something, give yourself permission to quit a task after 10 minutes. When you reach the 10-minute mark, ask yourself if you want to keep going or quit. You'll likely find that you have enough motivation to keep going.\n\n*   Getting started on a task is usually the hardest part.\n*   Once you get going, it's much easier to keep going.\n\n**Go For a Walk in Nature**\n\nFresh air, a change of scenery, and a little exercise can do wonders for your motivation. Walking in nature-as opposed to a busy urban street-can be especially beneficial.\n\n*   Being in nature offers a calming effect that rejuvenates the brain.\n*   It can help you feel more motivated to tackle a tough task.\n\n**Pair a Dreaded Task With Something You Enjoy**\n\nYour emotions play a major role in your motivation level. If you're sad, bored, lonely, or anxious, your desire to tackle a tough challenge or complete a tedious task will suffer. Boost your mood by adding a little fun to something you're not motivated to do.\n\n*   Listen to music while you run.\n*   Call a friend and talk while you're cleaning the house.\n*   Light a scented candle while you're working on your computer.\n\n**Manage Your To-Do List**\n\nIt's tough to feel motivated when your to-do list is overwhelming. If you feel like there's no hope in getting everything done, you might not try to do anything. Take a look at your to-do list and determine if it's too long.\n\n*   Get rid of tasks that aren't essential.\n*   See if other tasks can be moved to a different day.\n*   Prioritize the most important things on the list.\n\n**Practice Self-Care**\n\nYou'll struggle with motivation as long as you aren't caring for yourself. Create a healthy self-care plan that allows you to take care of your mind and body:\n\n*   Exercise regularly.\n*   Get plenty of sleep.\n*   Drink water, and eat a healthy diet.\n*   Make time for leisure and fun.\n\n**Reward Yourself for Working**\n\nCreate a small reward for yourself that you can earn for your hard work. You might find focusing on the reward helps you stay motivated to reach your goals.\n\n*   Write 500 words and take a 10-minute break.\n*   Eat one piece of chocolate after 30 minutes of work.\n*   Reward yourself when you complete the task.\n\n**Seek Professional Help**\n\nIf your motivation remains low for two or more weeks, seek professional help. You may also want to seek help if your lack of motivation is affecting your daily functioning.\n\n*   Schedule an appointment with your physician.\n*   Consider online therapy programs to address any underlying issues and tackle your lack of motivation.

I've experienced identity theft by someone who spent a few hundred bucks at various retailers in my name and mortgage fraud by someone trying to steal my entire down payment days before closing on my house.\n\n**The First Time: Identity Theft**\nOne day, I received a letter from Nordstrom notifying me that my application for a store credit card had been rejected. I was disappointed, but also very surprised since I never applied for the card in the first place. After conferring with my partner, we determined that I hadn't experienced any major dissociative states lately, so I was left with one inevitable conclusion: fraud.\n\n*   Within days, I received bills for new shoes from Macy's and some electronics from Best Buy.\n*   Seeing my name on a financial statement that did not belong to me was uniquely disorienting.\n*   The knowledge that my private information was out there for anyone to use, and the fear of what could come next, made me feel exposed and vulnerable.\n\n**The Second Time: Mortgage Fraud**\nMy experience with identity theft was stressful, but the second time it wasn't just about the cost of some shoes and a hit to my credit at stake. It was about the bulk of the savings my partner and I had been stashing for years.\n\n*   When trying to buy a house, beware of wire fraud.\n*   Someone hacked the email of either my lawyer or the title agency, or both, and spoofed it down to the font on the signatures.\n*   If you're like me, think \"Oh, I am too smart for that\" but in reality, even the smartest people fall for scams.\n\n**The Aftermath**\nIt's hard to describe the relief when you realize that you have dodged a major financial screw-up. But there are also intense feelings of vulnerability, fear, and shame.\n\n*   Even as I write this, I wonder who out there has my information and is working their way down a list of other potential victims until I am once again the target of the latest scam, hack, or fraud.\n*   It feels like there's constantly a finger hovering over a button that will steal all my money at any time. 9 Common Scams and The Tactics to Watch Out For Read More: LIVING WELL SELF-IMPROVEMENT By Nick Ingalls, MA Nick Ingalls, MA is the editorial director at Verywell Mind, managing new content production and editorial processes.
