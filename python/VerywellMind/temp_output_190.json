    "content": "With Us\n\n**The Psychology Behind Liminal Space**\n\nWhy transitional places or times can feel unsettling\n\nBy Theodora Blanchfield, AMFT\nUpdated on March 21, 2025\nMedically reviewed by Steven Gans, MD\nNanthawan Raksakulkan EyeEm Getty Images\n\n**Table of Contents**\n1.  Examples\n2.  Mental Health Effects\n3.  What Makes Liminal Spaces So Unsettling?\n4.  How to Cope With Liminal Spaces\n\n**Examples**\n\n*   A physical liminal space is perhaps the easiest to understand.\n*   You are in physical liminal spaces all the time, but typically, you often don't notice them because you're only there for fleeting moments.\n*   Think of a staircase.\n*   It takes you from one floor to another, and you often don't think twice about your time on a staircase.\n*   But what about if you get stuck in a stairwell?\n*   Then, visions of horror movies might start racing through your head.\n\n**Mental Health Effects**\n\nBeing in a liminal space can be incredibly uncomfortable for most people. Our brains crave homeostasis and predictability, and the liminal space is everything but. When faced with this uncertainty of how to proceed, you are thrown between where you have come from and where you are going.\n\n*   The key to making our way through these liminal spaces-physical, psychological, or emotional-can be tough.\n*   Whether you are moving to a new city, starting a new job, or experiencing some other big life transition, the in-between moments of our lives often create feelings of anxiety and uncertainty.\n*   But they can be opportunities for growth.\n\n**What Makes Liminal Spaces So Unsettling?**\n\nIt's more than just the fear of uncertainty. It becomes the fear that one will not have the emotional resources to cope. This leads to avoidant behaviors such as substance use or self-harm. Additionally, the fear of uncertainty may flood your body with stress hormones, making it even harder to come up for air.\n\n*   If existing in the liminal space becomes too much for you to deal with on your own, you might want to find a therapist to help you learn healthy ways to cope.\n*   On the other hand, beauty can lie in liminal spaces.\n*   Think of liminal spaces in architecture, like a beautiful atrium in the entryway of a museum.\n*   Liminality also can be an opportunity for transformation.\n*   It might not have been the path you would have chosen, but it is the path you are on now.\n\n**How to Cope With Liminal Spaces**\n\nWe all deal with liminal space at one point or another. And making our way through these liminal spaces-physical, psychological, or emotional-can be tough. Whether you are moving to a new city, starting a new job, or experiencing some other big life transition, the in-between moments of our lives often create feelings of anxiety and uncertainty.\n\n*   Creating comforting routines that provide stability and using effective stress management techniques can help you focus on personal growth while reducing the distress you might experience as you make the transition.\n*   Create Routines\n    *   Maintaining a routine when you are dealing with a stressful transition can provide a sense of stability and security.\n    *   Such routines help you feel grounded and connected to important parts of your life while providing a base for you to explore new things.\n*   Practice Mindfulness\n    *   Much of the distress associated with being in a transitional period comes from fear or catastrophizing what might happen.\n    *   So, stop for a moment to take stock of where you are right now.\n    *   What does uncertainty feel like in your body?\n    *   Then, observe your breath coming in and out as you remind yourself that you are OK in this moment.\n*   Embrace Your Current State\n    *   Although the uncertainty of being in a liminal space may be challenging, you must accept that it is where you are now.\n    *   The principles of dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) can help you understand that, although you can't control all circumstances, you can control your own thoughts, feelings, and reactions.\n*   Get Creative\n    *   Much of our entertainment and literature follows the hero's journey-essentially, something happens, the hero goes on a journey following that event, and it profoundly changes them. Yet, whether it be fictitious or true-to-life, creativity might flourish in times of uncertainty.\n    *   So, you might want to write or draw to express what it feels like to be in a liminal space.\n    *   Research has shown that expressive arts therapy can be an effective way to feel calmer and less stressed.8\n\n**Takeaways**\n\nLiminal spaces can create feelings of uneasiness and anxiety, but they can also be opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Regardless of where you're at in life at the moment, you still have the opportunities to learn new things and discover more about yourself.\n\n*   If you're really struggling during a period of transition, please reach out to a trained mental health professional.\n*   Journaling to Cope With Anxiety Read More: CONDITIONS A-Z DEPRESSION CAUSES 7 Sources By Theodora Blanchfield, AMFT Theodora Blanchfield is an Associate Marriage and Family Therapist and mental health writer using her experiences to help others.

It belongs to a class of drugs known as anticonvulsants. It works by decreasing the brain's vulnerability to having seizures and can also help to reduce pain.\n\n*   Neurontin is available as a generic medication sold under the name gabapentin.\n*   It comes in two forms: tablets or an oral solution.\n\n**Uses for Neurontin**\n\nNeurontin is approved by the FDA for the treatment of the following conditions:\n\n1.  Seizures: This medication is used to reduce the occurrence of seizures in children and adults with epilepsy.\n2.  Postherpetic neuralgia: Postherptic neuralgia is a condition that causes persistent nerve pain in people who have had shingles.\n\n**Off-Label Uses**\n\nNeurontin is sometimes prescribed off-label for the treatment of the following conditions:\n\n*   Bipolar disorder\n*   Fibromyalgia\n*   Migraines\n*   Anxiety\n\n**Before Taking Neurontin**\n\nBefore taking this medicine, you should go over the list of active and inactive ingredients with your doctor to make sure you are not allergic to any ingredient in it. Gabapentin is the active ingredient in Neurontin.\n\n*   Signs of an allergic reaction to gabapentin include swelling of the tongue, throat, or face, hives, and difficulty breathing.\n*   If you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant while taking this medication, please inform your doctor.\n*   There is not a lot of data on the effects of Neurotonin in pregnancy, and it's generally avoided if possible.\n\n**Side Effects of Neurontin**\n\nSome people might experience adverse effects while using Neurontin. Most are mild and will go away with time. In rare cases, these side effects might be more severe or worsen.\n\n*   Common side effects include insomnia, anxiety, mood swings, headache, dizziness, tiredness, nausea and vomiting in children.\n*   Severe side effects include difficulty breathing, extreme fatigue, confusion, and extreme drowsiness.\n\n**Neurontin Warnings and Interactions**\n\nThis medication can cause drowsiness, and taking alcohol alongside this medication can worsen this side effect. If you are about to go in for any kind of surgery, including dental surgery, inform your doctor that you are currently taking Neurontin.\n\n*   This medication might also make you lose coordination and slow down your reflexes.\n*   You shouldn't drive or operate heavy machinery until you've monitored how this medication affects you. Watch out for changes in moods and behaviors if you have a child who's taking Neurontin.\n*   They might experience sudden mood swings, become more hyperactive, or have difficulty paying attention.\n\n**Neurontin Dosage**\n\nYour doctor is most likely to consider a couple of things when deciding your dosage for Neurontin. They'll consider the severity of your condition, other medications you might be taking, and your tolerability (the degree to which a patient can handle adverse effects of a particular treatment).\n\n*   The manufacturer also recommends the following dosages for these conditions:\n    *   Epileptic seizures: An initial dose of 300 milligrams is given on day one, 300 milligrams twice a day on day two, and 300 milligrams three times a day on day three.\n    *   Nerve pain: As with epilepsy, an initial dose of 300 milligrams is given on day one, 300 milligrams twice a day on day two, and 300 milligrams three times a day on day three.\n\n**How to Take and Store Neurontin**\n\nNeurontin can be taken with or without food. Swallow any pill you take whole, without chewing or crushing it.\n\n*   If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, but if it's time for your next dose, skip the missed dose-don't double your dose.\n*   In many cases, Neurontin is prescribed to be taken three times a day. You shouldn't take all three doses at once or close together.\n\n**Neurontin Withdrawal**\n\nStopping Neurontin abruptly could cause withdrawal symptoms like tremors, high blood pressure, and gastrointestinal problems. Do not stop taking your medication without talking to your doctor first. They may recommend gradually tapering your dose over time to minimize potential withdrawal effects. 12 Sources By Toketemu Ohwovoriole Reviewed by Steven Gans, MD What To Know About Neurontin (Gabapentin) Read More: CONDITIONS A-Z BIPOLAR DISORDER TREATMENT 12 Sources By Toketemu Ohwovoriole Toketemu has been multimedia storyteller for the last four years.

Depression can make a person feel like a burden, unworthy of love and support. Counteract these thoughts by telling and showing your loved one that you still care about them. 2. It's not uncommon for people with depression to struggle with feelings of anger, irritability, or withdrawal. These behaviors are symptoms of the illness and not personal attacks on you.

For instance, you might wonder: What does depression feel like for my partner? What can I do to help support them? How can I take care of myself? Will their symptoms impact our relationship and, if so, how can we navigate any issues together? All of these questions are normal and it's understandable that you'd want to support your loved one to the best of your ability. While your questions are valid, it's also important to understand that every person's experience with depression is unique so here are a few things you can do to help your loved one and yourself. 8 Ways to Provide Emotional Support for Your Partner Learn More About Depression You can support your loved one by learning everything you can about depression, including its causes, symptoms, and treatments. Ask your partner's doctor for some sources that provide the facts about depression, or do your own search. Start with these reputable sources: Anxiety and Depression Association of America Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance Mental Health America National Alliance on Mental Illness National Institute of Mental Health An Overview of Clinical Depression Understand What Depression Really Means There are many myths about depression. For example, depression is not simply the result of laziness or weakness. Your partner's pain may not just be in their head. Depression doesn't need a reason. If you are unfamiliar with depression, challenge preconceived thoughts, ideas, and stigma by educating yourself. It's especially important to validate your partner's feelings and experience of this very real and biologically based illness. Know that just like any other illness, it can be treated.1 Suicide is also a very real risk of depression, so it's important to keep your loved one's environment safe (such as removing any alcohol, drugs, or guns) and to take it seriously if your loved one is feeling suicidal. If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. Practice Self-Care It can be very stressful coping with another person's depression. It's OK to take some time out for yourself. Self-care is not selfish. In fact, you'll both be better off if you carve out time to safeguard your mind, body, and spirit with habits like: Eating a healthy diet Exercising Getting enough sleep Participating in hobbies and activities you enjoy Praying or meditating Practicing relaxation strategies Spending time in nature Staying socially connected Caring for yourself might also mean knowing when it's time to say goodbye. Certainly, this decision should be weighed carefully (and ideally, discussed with a mental health professional). But if your or your children's emotional or physical well-being or safety is at risk, you may need to walk away. Seek Therapy When someone you care about is depressed, it's OK for you to feel frustrated, angry, and upset. It is very important, however, that you don't allow these feelings to fester and grow. Therapists, counselors, and support groups are not only for people with depression. Seeking professional help for yourself can help you feel supported, vent your frustrations, and make you more aware of your own emotional needs. Therapy can also provide answers to any questions you have about coping with the depression of a loved one. Even if you don't go the mental health professional route, it's important to lean on your support network during this difficult time. Get Help Now We've tried, tested, and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, BetterHelp, and ReGain. Find out which option is the best for you. Should I Ask My Partner About Their Therapy Sessions? Be There for Your Partner One of the most important things you can do for someone who is depressed is simply to be there for them and verbalize your support. Hold them close or just listen while they share their feelings. Offer to help them with making appointments or doing some of the daily chores that they are struggling to keep up with. Let them know that you are there for them in whatever way they need while they make their recovery. How to Help Someone Who Is Depressed Don't Take Your Partner's Depression Personally Depression can make people behave in ways that they normally wouldn't when they are feeling well. They",

    "title": "What to Know About Childhood Depression",
    "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/childhood-depression-1066805",
    "content": "on This Article Did you find what you were looking for? Yes No   What to Know About Childhood Depression\n**Childhood Depression: A Guide**\n \n**Overview**\n\nAlthough most people think of depression as an adult illness, children and adolescents can develop depression as well. Unfortunately, many children with depression go untreated because adults don't recognize they're depressed.\n\n*   It's essential for parents, teachers, and other adults to learn about childhood depression.\n*   Understanding the symptoms of depression in children and the reasons children develop it can help intervene in a helpful manner.\n\n**How Children Experience Depression**\n\nDepression in children and teens usually presents differently than it does in adults. Young children often find it difficult to explain their feelings and may regress to earlier behaviors such as thumb-sucking or bed-wetting. They may have more nightmares and difficulty sleeping. Irritability and or anger are more common signs of depression in older children and teens.\n\n*   Children with family members who also have mood disorders, such as depression, are at a greater risk of experiencing these symptoms.\n*   Brain chemistry imbalances and environmental factors can contribute to feelings of depression.\n\n**Causes of Childhood Depression**\n\nWhile stressful life events, like divorce, may contribute to depression, it's only a small piece of the puzzle. Many other factors, including genetics, differences in neurological or physical development, major illness, and other psychosocial factors, also play a role in its onset.\n\n*   Family history: Genetics play a significant role in creating a predisposition for mood disorders.\n*   Brain chemistry: Imbalances in certain neurotransmitters and hormones may play a role in how the brain works, which can affect moods and emotions and increase the risk of experiencing depression.\n*   Environmental factors: A stressful, chaotic, or unstable home environment can also make children more likely to experience depression.\n\n**Diagnosing Childhood Depression**\n\nIf you think your child is showing signs of depression, schedule an appointment with your child's pediatrician to discuss your concerns. Before arriving at a diagnosis, your child should undergo a comprehensive physical evaluation to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the symptoms you are seeing.\n\n*   A doctor may use one or multiple psychological assessments to further evaluate the type and severity of depression your child is experiencing.\n*   Classification of Depression: When your child is diagnosed with a depressive disorder, it is typically classified by severity:\n    *   Mild\n    *   Moderate\n    *   Severe (also called major or clinical depression)\n\n**Treatment for Childhood Depression**\n\nFor mild cases of depression, lifestyle changes can often be an effective way to address feelings of depression. For adolescents with moderate to severe depression, research has shown that a combination of psychotherapy and medication works best.\n\n*   Psychotherapy: Helps improve a child's mood by identifying negative thought and behavior patterns and replacing them with positive ones.\n*   Medications: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered the first-line antidepressant option for young people with depression. Only two SSRIs-Prozac (fluoxetine) and Lexapro (escitalopram)-are FDA-approved for use in young people with depression.\n\n**Coping**\n\nFor mild cases of depression, lifestyle changes can often be an effective way to address feelings of depression. Things like finding ways to manage stress, getting regular physical exercise, using relaxation techniques, developing new hobbies and interests, and building a stronger social support system can help improve how a child feels.\n\n*   Encourage healthy coping skills and support mental health by talking about the importance of self-care.\n*   Help your child develop a rich social life without over-scheduling their time. Assign responsibilities and reward them when they follow through. Teach your child how to identify their feelings and their needs and how to manage their emotions in healthy ways.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nChildhood depression can have a serious impact on a child's life, so it is always important to be on the lookout for warning signs that your child may be depressed.

    "content": "**What Is Birthday Depression?**\n\nBirthday depression, or the birthday blues, refers to feeling sad, apathetic, or disinterested in celebrating or thinking about your birthday. In addition to experiencing sadness, birthday depression can also include a sense of low energy or focusing on the past, including everything that you may or may not have accomplished so far.\n\n**Birthday Depression and Other Mental Health Conditions**\n\nOur diagnostic manual (DSM-5) does not recognize birthday depression as a mental health disorder, says Dr. Ernesto Lira de la Rosa, PhD, a licensed clinical psychologist and member of the media advisory group at the Hope for Depression Research Foundation. However, he notes that this does not mean that individuals don't experience depression or sadness during a birthday.\n\n1.  It could be associated with other mental health disorders, such as depression or anxiety.\n2.  For individuals who have a history of depression, it would not be uncommon for them to experience sadness around their birthdays as well.\n\n**Potential Causes and Reasons**\n\nFor some, it could be tied to previous negative experiences with birthdays. Others may reflect on their lives and may not feel they are where they wanted to be by that specific age, says Dr. Lira de la Rosa. For others, birthdays can come during times when they are going through something difficult.\n\n1.  Depression (it's estimated that 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. have received a diagnosis of depression in their lifetime)\n2.  Anxiety\n3.  Fear of getting old\n4.  History of family drama on birthdays during childhood\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nDr. Lira de la Rosa says many of the symptoms related to birthday depression are similar to symptoms of regular depression. So, how can you know if you have birthday depression? Certain signs may alert you that you are experiencing the birthday blues, including but not limited to the following:\n\n1.  A change in your mood that persists and lasts for several days surrounding your birthday\n2.  Feeling more low, down, or sad than usual\n3.  Crying more often than usual\n4.  Ruminating on the past and goals unaccomplished (e.g., not getting married or having kids yet)\n5.  Stressing about how much time you have left to live\n6.  Not having much energy or motivation to do things\n7.  Lack of interest in doing what you typically enjoy\n8.  Changes in sleep\n9.  Changes in appetite\n10. Difficulty focusing or concentrating\n11. Physical aches or pains\n12. Wanting to avoid the actual day of your birthday\n13. Disinterest in celebrating your birthday (e.g., rejecting or refusing plans to celebrate with friends or family)\n14. Desire to isolate yourself\n\n**How to Cope With Birthday Depression**\n\nThere are different treatments and coping mechanisms to choose from that may help to heal your birthday blues and simply ease any negative feelings.\n\n1.  Allow Your Emotions to Arise\n2.  Practice Awareness and Self-Compassion\n3.  Talk About Your Experience With Someone You Trust\n4.  Celebrate However You Feel Comfortable\n5.  Prepare for Your Birthday With Healthy Activities\n6.  Speak to a Therapist\n\n**A Word From Verywell**\n\nAlthough birthdays are typically associated with happy feelings and positive experiences, this may not be the case for everybody. If you experience birthday depression, please don't feel ashamed. It's very common and normal for people to feel sad around their birthday. However, if your birthday depression leads to extreme feelings of sadness, anxiety, or isolation, you may want to consult a mental health professional for help.",

    "content": "**Why Are College Students So Depressed?**\n\nIt may not always feel like the best four years of your life.\n\nBy Kendra Cherry, MSEd\nUpdated on September 12, 2023\nReviewed by David Susman, PhD\nAndreswd Getty Images\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n*   Symptoms of Depression in College Students\n*   What Percentage of College Students Experience Depression?\n*   What Really Causes Depression in College Students?\n*   Impact of Depression on Academic and Personal Life\n*   Coping With Depression in College\n*   Treatments for Depression in College Students\n*   Resources\n*   How Schools Can Help\n*   FAQ\n\nDepression is one of the most common mental health conditions and affects people of all ages, including college students. It impacts thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and is characterized by persistent sadness and loss of interest in once-enjoyable activities. This condition is prevalent on college campuses, affecting an estimated 53% of students at some point.\n\nCollege students are a vulnerable population who are faced with a range of new and often wonderful-yet sometimes stressful-experiences, explains Randall Dwenger, MD, the chief medical officer at Mountainside Treatment Center. He also notes that people who have a predisposition to depression typically start to display symptoms during their early 20s.\n\nDepression can take a toll on many aspects of a young person's life, including academic performance, social life, and physical health. It can also increase their risk of substance abuse and co-occurring mental health conditions. For this reason, it is crucial to recognize the signs of depression in college students and provide tools, resources, and support that can help.\n\n**Symptoms of Depression in College Students**\n\nEven mild symptoms may significantly interfere with academic and social functioning, explains Amy Mezulis, PhD, a licensed clinical psychologist and chief clinical officer of Joon. She also notes that it can lead to symptoms such as trouble concentrating, fatigue, and low energy, which can make it tough for students to keep up with academic work.\n\nSome common symptoms of depression in college students include:\n\n*   Feeling sad, low, or empty\n*   Loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities\n*   Difficulty concentrating and making decisions\n*   Missing class\n*   Poor grades\n*   Not having the motivation to finish assignments\n*   Poor self-care and personal hygiene\n*   Using drugs or alcohol to cope with difficult emotions\n*   Irritability or restlessness\n*   Guilt, helplessness, or hopelessness\n*   Lack of energy or fatigue\n*   Feelings of worthlessness\n*   Reduced physical activity\n*   Changes in sleep habits and appetite\n*   Thoughts of self-harm or suicide\n\n**What Percentage of College Students Experience Depression?**\n\nDepression rates among U.S. college students are at an all-time high and growing. According to one internet-based survey, 44% reported that they currently have symptoms of depression, and 15% said they had considered suicide in the past year.\n\nA 2022 study published in the Journal of Affective Disorders examined data from the national Healthy Minds study between the years 2013 and 2021. The researchers found that there has been a steady, consistent decline in the mental health of college students throughout the United States, amounting to a 135% increase in depression over the course of those eight years.\n\n**What Really Causes Depression in College Students?**\n\nLeaving home for the first time can be an exciting but also challenging time for many students. It can be a time of self-discovery and personal growth, but it can also be stressful, anxiety-provoking, and isolating for many. The following are just some of the common factors that can play a role in the onset of depression among college-age students.\n\n*   Transitions and Adjustments\n*   Relationships and Social Pressures\n*   Financial Stress\n*   Poor Sleep\n*   Substance Use\n*   Other Hurdles\n\n**Impact of Depression on Academic and Personal Life**\n\nThe high rates of depression among college students negatively affect physical health, mental well-being, academic success, and interpersonal relationships. These effects can be distressing and far-reaching.\n\nDepression can lead to poor test performance and bad grades, which even jeopardize a student's ability to graduate and, for those depending on academic scholarships, impair their ability to keep their form of financial support.\n\nDepression also makes it more challenging for students to enjoy many of the experiences that are often associated with college. Extracurricular activities, social events, and hobbies that they used to enjoy lose their appeal. This often means that they stop participating in these activities altogether.\n\n**Coping With Depression in College**\n\nIf you are a college student struggling with depression, there are a few things that you can do that may help make it easier to cope. Make a plan for how you'll take care of your mental health before college begins. Brainstorm ways to tackle challenges such as finding community, adjusting to living in a new place away from family and friends, keeping up with a different level of academic work, or getting the right amount of good nutrition, exercise, and sleep.\n\nTry behavioral activation, which involves scheduling activities that help promote a positive mood and well-being, even if you might not necessarily feel in the mood. This includes scheduling things like social events, exercise, and even daily tasks like doing your laundry and homework.\n\n**Treatments for Depression in College Students**\n\nWhile there are many strategies you can use on your own to improve your mental health and ability to cope, it is important to seek professional help if your symptoms have lasted longer than two weeks and or are making it difficult to function in your daily life. Treatment options can include on- or off-campus options.\n\nTalking to a mental health professional at your school's counseling center or student health services can be a great place to start. They can provide further options about mental health services that are available on-campus or refer you to off-campus providers.\n\nYour doctor or therapist may recommend a few different options to treat your depression. Because depression is complex and influenced by a number of factors, research suggests that a combination of therapy and medication is often the most effective treatment approach.\n\nTherapy can help you gain insights, improve relationships, and develop new coping skills. Medication can help people find relief from symptoms of depression. Antidepressants that are commonly prescribed include Prozac (fluoxetine), Paxil (paroxetine), Zoloft (sertraline), Celexa (citalopram), and Lexapro (escitalopram).\n\n**Resources**\n\nIf you are experiencing depression, there are many resources available to help you. These include:\n\n*   Student Support Services: Offers a range of services for academic and personal development and may provide counseling services\n*   Counseling Center: Provides counseling services to students experiencing mental health concerns\n*   Student Health Center: Offers a variety of health services to students, including mental health care\n*   Psychology Clinic: Provides psychological services to students and community members\n\nSome colleges and universities also offer teletherapy services. Other places to turn if you are experiencing depression include your resident advisor (RA), academic advisor, a trusted professor, or campus helpline.\n\n**How Schools Can Help**\n\nEvery college should have a comprehensive plan designed to address aspects of student mental health. Such plans should include strategies",

While it's often experienced by mothers, it can also be experienced by fathers.\n\n*   The presence of a new child is a major life change.\n*   Fathers, like mothers, need to pay attention to their mental health.\n*   Exhaustion and stress, in addition to other factors, can lead to male postpartum depression.\n\n**The Effects of Postpartum Depression**\n\nFeeling exhausted, overwhelmed, and stressed following the birth of a child is a normal aspect of parenthood. Still, if symptoms persist or if they interfere with daily life or the ability to care for the child, then it could be postpartum depression.\n\n*   This is true for both mothers and fathers.\n*   Many postpartum depression symptoms are synonymous with a major depressive disorder.\n*   Symptoms vary from person to person.\n*   You may experience some, not all, and they can vary in degree.\n\n**The Underdiagnosis of PPD in Men**\n\nWomen are often screened by their doctor for postpartum depression, but men typically aren't. They are also more likely to underreport their symptoms, which is why postpartum depression in men can go undiagnosed and untreated.\n\n*   If you're a new father experiencing persistent and ongoing symptoms of depression, you'll want to notify your partner, doctor, and or mental health professional.\n*   Depression doesn't go away on its own, so the sooner you're diagnosed, the sooner you can begin treatment and relieve symptoms.\n\n**Treating Postpartum Depression**\n\nTreatment for postpartum depression is similar to treatment for clinical depression. Depending on your situation and the severity of your depression, you may be prescribed medication, therapy, or a combination of both.\n\n*   As of August 4, 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved Zuranolone as the first oral treatment for postpartum depression.\n*   Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are also commonly used medications for postpartum depression.\n*   Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) are psychotherapies known to relieve symptoms of postpartum depression.\n\n**How Common Is PPD in Men?**\n\nSupporting the results of the Verywell Mind and Parents survey, prior research has shown that about 8% of fathers experience paternal depression. Unfortunately, many cases of postnatal depression go undiagnosed in men, so early diagnosis and intervention are important for the health of the father and the family.\n\n*   Many factors can contribute to the development or worsening of postpartum depression.\n*   The effects of ignoring male postpartum depression narratives around the experience of postpartum depression often exclude men, even though fathers can and do experience the disorder.\n*   When male postpartum depression goes undiagnosed, it can harm the whole family.\n\n**Coping With PPD**\n\nWhen men suffer from postpartum depression, it can impact their ability to function and properly care for their partner and child. In addition to maintaining healthy self-care habits, which can include meditation or therapy, Tishman recommends:\n\n*   Exercising regularly\n*   Eating healthy foods\n*   Maintaining healthy sleep habits\n*   Talking about and expressing feelings\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMale postpartum depression can go undiagnosed for many months, but it is treatable. If you're a new father experiencing symptoms of depression, talk to your primary care physician or a mental health professional. If your loved one expresses concern over your mental health, then it's important to seek professional help so you can better care for yourself, your partner, and your new child. 1., The effects of paternal depression can be just as severe for children as they are for mothers.2., According to the World Health Organization (WHO), fathers with postpartum depression are at risk of experiencing major depressive disorder and substance misuse disorders in their lifetime.3., Depression is a treatable condition.4., If you or your partner are struggling with postpartum depression, it's time to seek professional help.5., 6., In some cases, the symptoms of paternal depression may not be as severe, but that doesn't mean they're any less important.7., Fathers can experience anxiety and feelings of guilt after the birth of a child, which can impact their mental health and relationships with their partners and children.8., A father's postpartum depression can have a significant impact on his child's development and increase the risk of psychiatric disorders in early childhood.9., The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that fathers be screened for postpartum depression as part of routine perinatal care.10 1., Men are just as susceptible to experiencing postpartum depression as women.2., In fact, research suggests that men who experience paternal depression may have a higher risk of developing major depressive disorder in the future.3., The effects of paternal depression on children can be significant and long-lasting.4.,",

    "content": "**How to Fight Depression Without Medication**\n\nDepression is a serious condition that may grow worse over time if left untreated. There are many ways to counter some of the symptoms of depression that don't involve prescription medications.\n\n*   If you have depression, you might like to try managing it naturally without medication or supplement your antidepressant with other options.\n*   This article discusses some natural treatments that may help fight depression including lifestyle changes and supplements.\n*   It also covers other strategies you might try such as practicing mindfulness or enhancing your home environment.\n\n**The Best Online Therapy Services for Depression**\n\nWe Tried and Tested\n\nSome research suggests that there are natural antidepressants that may help reduce symptoms of depression. For treating mild to moderate depression, dietary supplements such as St. John's Wort, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e), and 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) may be worth a try.\n\n*   Research has shown that St. John's wort is more effective than a placebo at relieving symptoms in those with mild-to-moderate depression.\n*   Omega-3 fatty acids have also been investigated for their potential impact on depression.\n*   While natural remedies can be good options for depression treatment, you should always consult your healthcare provider before taking them.\n\n**Tap Into Your Spirituality**\n\nReligion can be an impactful source of support for many people dealing with depression. But there is no need to join a church, synagogue, or mosque unless you wish to.\n\n*   Simple daily practices such as meditation or adding to a list of things you're grateful can help boost mood and overall well-being.\n*   Meditation can have a range of beneficial effects such as lowering stress levels and helping people to become more aware of their thoughts and reactions.\n*   There are many different types of meditation, but you can get started with a simple meditative exercise with these steps: Sit comfortably. Close your eyes. Breathe naturally. Focus on how your body feels while you breathe.\n\n**Get More Exercise**\n\nGetting more exercise doesn't have to mean training for a marathon, but it does mean putting in a half-hour or so of low-intensity activity each day, which has been found to be effective in improving mood and quality of life.\n\n*   Even better, take it outdoors. Fresh air and sunshine are especially healing for folks dealing with a special form of depression known as seasonal affective disorder (SAD).\n*   Lack of energy and low mood may mean that you simply feel too fatigued to get up and get active.\n*   Some things that you can try to stick to your habit: Enlist a friend. Ask a loved one to walk with you or do another form of exercise at least a few times a week.\n\n**Add Greenery to Your Home or Office**\n\nYou may also find it helpful to add indoor plants to your home or office environment. Natural settings are associated with improved mental well-being, so it makes sense that bringing the outdoors in might help improve your mood.\n\n*   Research has shown that adding indoor plants to your home or office can help in a variety of ways, including: Improving the workplace: Research has shown that office spaces enhanced with indoor plants improve worker concentration and workplace satisfaction.\n*   Reducing stress levels: Another study found that actively interacting with indoor plans by caring for them can reduce both physiological and psychological stress.\n\n**Tend to Your Social Life**\n\nWhen you're depressed, there's no reason to go it alone, and there are all sorts of reasons to reach out to friends and family. Make plans with loved ones and keep those dates. Join a club or sign up for a group activity such as a local dodgeball league or a French class.\n\n*   Other things you might try: Join a support group. Talking to other people who are going through similar experiences and challenges can be informative and helpful.\n*   Schedule activities. Having routines can be helpful when you are going through depression.\n\n**Have a Daily Routine**\n\nThe symptoms of depression can also make it difficult to stick to a schedule, but research suggests that having a routine can be critical for mental health.\n\n*   Maintaining a routine can also help you hold on to a sense of normalcy and stability when you are dealing with feelings of depression, stress, or anxiety.\n*   Not having a daily routine, on the other hand, can increase your feelings of stress and leave you feeling overwhelmed and unable to focus. So work on having a schedule that includes the basic things you need to get done as well as plenty of self-care.\n\n**Listen to Upbeat Music**\n\nThere's no doubt that music can have an impact on how you feel, so choosing the right music when you're feeling down might be an effective way of lifting your mood. Research has found people who are depressed may have a tendency to choose music that intensifies rumination, sadness, and emotion-focused coping.\n\n*   So while you might be tempted to turn to somber tearjerkers when you're feeling down, consider listening to more upbeat songs to boost your mood and inspire positive feelings.\n\n**Summary**\n\nDepression is a serious condition that may grow worse over time if left untreated. There are many ways to counter some of the symptoms of depression that don't involve prescription medications.\n\n*   If you have depression, you might like to try managing it naturally without medication or supplement your antidepressant with other options.\n*   This article discusses some natural treatments that may help fight depression including lifestyle changes and supplements.\n*   It also covers other strategies you might try such as practicing mindfulness or enhancing your home environment.\n\n**Get Help Now**\n\nWe've tried, tested, and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, Betterhelp, and Regain.
