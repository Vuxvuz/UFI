Holding onto some of those beliefs might cause you to suffer. When this happens, psychotherapists sometimes encourage clients to perform behavioral experiments that test the reality of their beliefs.\n\n**How Behavioral Experiments Work**\n\nThe behavioral experiments we are talking about are rooted in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a technique that focuses on your thoughts and beliefs that are negatively affecting you and learning to reframe those thoughts and beliefs so that they aren't so negative. Cognitive behavioral therapists help you become aware of your problems and the thoughts, emotions, and beliefs about your problems.\n\n*   Identify the exact belief thought process the experiment will target\n*   Brainstorm ideas for the experiment\n*   Predict the outcome and devise a method to record the outcome\n*   Anticipate challenges and brainstorm solutions\n*   Conduct the experiment\n*   Review the experiment and draw conclusions\n\n**Examples of Behavioral Experiments**\n\nPsychotherapists may assist you in designing a behavioral experiment that can counteract almost any distorted way of thinking. Here are a few examples:\n\n1.  **Confronting Perfectionism**: A woman believes people will only like her if she is perfect. Her perfectionist tendencies create a lot of stress and anxiety.\n2.  **Overcoming Social Anxiety**: A man believes he's socially awkward. Consequently, he rarely attends social events-and when he does, he sits in the corner by himself.\n3.  **Dealing with Infidelity Fears**: A woman worries her boyfriend is cheating on her. She checks his social media accounts throughout the day to see what he is doing.\n4.  **Improving Sleep Hygiene**: A man struggles to stay asleep at night. When he wakes up, he turns on the TV and watches it until he falls asleep again.\n5.  **Managing Depression**: A woman with depression doesn't go to work on days when she feels bad. On these days she stays in bed all day watching TV.\n\n**Getting Started**\n\nIf you're interested in testing some of the potentially self-limiting beliefs you've been holding onto, try designing your own behavioral experiment. If you're not certain how to get started, want some help designing the experiment, or would like to learn more about how to recognize irrational beliefs, then contact a cognitive behavioral therapist.\n\n**References**\n\n*   By Amy Morin, LCSW\n*   Updated by Hannah Owens, LMSW\n\n**Share Your Thoughts**\n\nYou can share your thoughts about this article with us.

Block, MD\n\nIka84 Getty Images\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\nHow the Stress-Vulnerability Model Works\nEpigenetics\nHow to Boost Protective Factors\nCriticisms\nStress affects everybody, but not all of us respond to it in the same way. The stress-vulnerability model, also known as the diathesis-stress model, helps explain why some people are more susceptible to mental health ailments.\n\nThe model was developed in 1977 by Zubin and Spring to explain the development of schizophrenia. After its initial introduction to the mental health world, the model extended to include a broad range of psychiatric diagnoses.1 There is no simple explanation for why mental illness happens. That's because, in most cases, there are many factors that play a role.\n\nThe vulnerability-stress model helps researchers and mental health practitioners understand how genetics and stress intersect to affect a person's risk of experiencing mental health problems. Keep reading to learn more about the vulnerability- stress model, some criticism it has received, the impact stress can have on us, and ways to boost protective factors to fight against stress.\n\n**How the Stress-Vulnerability Model Works**\n\nThe stress-vulnerability model suggests that the risk of developing a psychiatric disorder comes down to two big factors: biological vulnerability and stress. But there is good news, too. Protective factors-like a strong social support system, self-care, and healthy coping strategies-can help dial down both biological vulnerability and stress.\n\nElements of the Stress-Vulnerability Model\n\n1. Biological Vulnerability\n2. Stress\n3. Protective Factors\n\n**Biological Vulnerability**\n\nBiological vulnerability refers to one's genetic predisposition. For example, bipolar disorder is known to have a genetic link and is often passed down in families.2 Biological vulnerability also accounts for experiences that could have occurred in the womb or as a baby.1\n\n**Stress**\n\nWhile stress can contribute to developing a mental health disorder, it isn't the only factor at play. For example, someone may already have a genetic predisposition to a mental health disorder, but they have not developed it yet. If a person is genetically predisposed to a mental health condition, a major life event or a series of stressful events can trigger the onset of a mental health disorder.\n\nExamples of these life stressors include:\n\n*   Life crises (e.g., death of a loved one, major illness)\n*   Substance use\n*   Personal and job-related stressors\n\nWhen this significant life crisis occurs, some of the disorder's symptoms can emerge. However, remember that the probability of this depends on the type of psychiatric condition the person is predisposed to.1\n\n**Protective Factors**\n\nProtective factors are critical for keeping stress and biological vulnerability in check. Think of them as your mental health safety net. Such factors can include:\n\n*   Having a solid support system-people who listen, communicate well, and have your back\n*   Following a structured daily routine-consistent habits are important for mental health\n*   Keeping stress levels low(ish)-while it's sometimes easier said than done, setting boundaries to help keep the chaos to a minimum can go a long way toward protecting your peace\n\n**Epigenetics**\n\nAnother element of the stress vulnerability model is called epigenetics. Epigenetics speaks to how our environment, behaviors, and lifestyle can change our genes. These changes begin before you are even born, meaning you are impacted by the environment, behaviors, and lifestyles of your lineage. However, your epigenetics also change throughout your life.\n\nThis is positive because it indicates that some epigenetic changes can be reversed. A simple example of this is how some former smokers can reach the same DNA methylation as non-smokers.4 Again, this is more evidence that we aren't destined to be vulnerable simply based on our gene expression.\n\n**Generational Trauma**\n\nEpigenetics is also a component of generational trauma. For example, some of the stress experienced during a mother's pregnancy will then influence the baby's gene expression. This can lead to strengths and vulnerabilities.5 There is also research indicating that epigenetics can expand across multiple generations, with some pivotal research specifically focusing on generational trauma resulting from structural racism creating adverse health outcomes in the Black community.6\n\nAgain, it is important to remember that gene expressions can be shifted. Just because we experienced stress while in utero or because we have come from an oppressed lineage does not mean we are destined to be sick.7 Protective factors are immensely helpful in ensuring that we are not limited based on our genes.\n\n**How to Boost Protective Factors**\n\nDecreasing stress is a great way to minimize your vulnerability to developing severe ailments. However, this may seem challenging while living in an already complicated world. Rather than solely focusing on reducing stress, let's consider how you can build upon your protective factors:\n\n*   Assess your current points of stress and take a look at your community resources\n*   What is your support system like?\n*   Do you have any hobbies or talents?\n\n**Criticisms**\n\nWhile the Stress-Vulnerability Model has been instrumental in helping us better understand psychiatric ailments, it hasn't been without its critics. The Term 'Vulnerability' Is Limiting\n\nA 2022 article published in Frontiers in Sociology found the model's focus on vulnerability to be disempowering. Noting the nearly 50 years that have passed since the model was introduced, the article found the model's emphasis on vulnerability to be a distraction from the actual harm at hand.1 For example, if one's form of stress is abuse at the hands of caregivers, simply removing the caregivers will not solve the issue of stress as a key vulnerability.\n\nInstead, there must be support from individuals who understand the needs of someone who has experienced abuse.1\n\n**Takeaways**\n\nWe all experience different types of stress throughout our lives, but the lingering impact it has on our health and well-being can vary depending on things like our biological vulnerabilities and coping mechanisms. Some people are more susceptible, which is why it's important to take steps to manage your stress and get the support you need.\n\nIf you're experiencing stress or trauma,",

The first step is to congratulate yourself for taking the first step toward your mental health treatment journey (it's a big one). Starting therapy is a personal decision, so it's essential to decide which environment and schedule may work best for you. For example, you might want to consider online therapy if you prefer the convenience of meeting with your therapist over video or via a phone call in the comfort of your own home. 2. Find a Therapist The next step is to find a provider you'd like to work with. There are many different places where you can begin looking for a therapist, including: - Insurance directory: Check with your health insurance provider to see if they have a directory of therapists who accept your insurance. - Recommendations from friends: Friends who have had great experiences with a particular therapist can be an excellent resource when you are looking for a treatment provider. - Referrals from your doctor: Your primary care provider can also be an excellent place to start your search. - Mental health organizations: Many mental health organizations, including the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) and the American Psychological Association, maintain therapist directories listing professionals who are qualified to treat different conditions. - Online therapy directories: You can also do an online search to find therapist directories where you can search based on a therapist's education, identities (including racial, cultural, gender, and sexual identities), treatment specialty, therapeutic approach, experience, and geographic location. - Online therapy platforms: Many online sites also ask you to provide some basic information on what you'd like to address in therapy, such as anxiety, parenting issues, or substance use. Then, they will give you several therapists to choose from or assign you a therapist based on your answers.\n\n**What Is Therapy?**\n\nTherapy, also known as psychotherapy or talk therapy, refers to the techniques that help people change behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that cause problems or distress.\n\n*   Problems alleviated by therapy can include difficulties in dealing with loss, stress at home or work, working through trauma, and coping with symptoms of specific mental conditions.\n*   Research shows that therapy can help reduce depression, anxiety, and eating disorder symptoms, as well as those struggling with addiction.\n\n**Do I Need Therapy?**\n\nYou don't need to be dealing with a clinically diagnosed mental health condition to try therapy - anyone can benefit from seeking support to manage their mental health.\n\n*   If stressors are interfering with your day-to-day, whether at home, work, or in your interpersonal relationships, it may be time to see a therapist.\n*   Therapy is not just for those dealing with serious mental health issues; it's also a great way to improve yourself and gain life-long solutions. - AMY MORIN, LCSW\n\n**How Much Does Therapy Cost?**\n\nTherapy may cost, on average, anywhere between $60-$200 per hour, though costs vary depending on a number of factors.\n\n*   Online providers tend to be on the lower end of that range at $60 to $100 per week, while in-person therapy sessions will usually cost between $100 and $200.\n*   Suffice it to say, cost can be a massive barrier to treatment. - AKEEM MARSH, MD\n\n**How Does Therapy Work?**\n\nWhen you've found a provider you might be interested in working with, it's best practice to schedule a consultation, which many providers will offer for free.\n\n*   This will give you the chance to learn more about the therapist and give them a preliminary idea of what you are looking for.\n*   During the first session, your therapist may ask you: What are your symptoms? What brought you to therapy? What might make your life better? What are your goals for treatment?\n\n**How Long Does Therapy Take?**\n\nDepending on your issue and therapy goals, therapy can last a few sessions or several months or years.\n\n*   While you likely want to know how long it's going to take to feel better, there's no simple answer. It's very individualized.\n*   In addition, some insurance plans only cover a set number of sessions in a given year, so you may need to factor in those limitations and/or work with your therapist to come up with a payment plan.\n\n**How to Get Started With Therapy**\n\nThe first step is to congratulate yourself for taking the first step toward your mental health treatment journey (it's a big one).\n\n*   Starting therapy is a personal decision, so it's essential to decide which environment and schedule may work best for you.\n*   For example, you might want to consider online therapy if you prefer the convenience of meeting with your therapist over video or via a phone call in the comfort of your own home.\n\n**Techniques and Types of Therapy**\n\nDepending on the condition being treated, there are many different approaches to talk therapy catered to the individual's unique needs.\n\n*   The type of approach may also depend on the expertise of the mental health professional.\n*   Learn more about some of them below. - \n\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a type of psychotherapy that emphasizes acceptance of negative thoughts, feelings, symptoms, and circumstances rather than trying to change them or make them more positive.\n\nBehavioral Therapy Behavioral therapy adopts a number of techniques to help with identifying and changing your negative or self-destructive behaviors.\n\nCognitive Therapy Cognitive therapy looks to help you become aware of and change negative and dysfunctional ways of thinking.\n\nCouples Therapy Couples therapy is a form of psychotherapy that can help you and your partner at any stage of your relationship regardless of marital status, age, race, faith, or sexual orientation.\n\nDialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a modified type of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Its main goals are to teach you how to live in the moment, develop healthy ways to cope with distress, regulate your emotions, and improve your relationships with others.\n\nEMDR Therapy Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is a psychotherapy that uses rhythmic left-right (bilateral) stimulation to help people recover from trauma or other distressing life experiences. It is an approach that essentially re-trains your brain when remembering traumatic events.\n\nFamily Therapy Family therapy is a type of treatment designed to help with issues that specifically affect families' mental health and functioning.\n\n**A Word From Verywell**\n\nWhether you are looking for help with a specific condition or just more general support for your everyday life, therapy can be a great choice. You can see a therapist in person or online and should look for a provider with whom you get along and trust. - \n\nIllustration by Ellen Lindner Read More: THERAPY 2 Sources Updated by Hannah Owens, LMSW See Our Editorial Process Meet Our Review Board Share Feedback on This Article Was this article helpful?
