It was a picture-perfect day on the outside. The photo I posted on Instagram that day was perfect: my cute NYC card seen through a sparkling glass of champagne. I wasn't trying to hoodwink anyone except myself. If I posted the perfect picture, and had the perfect moments, maybe I would be happy. But despite that nice moment, I wasn't happy. And I couldn't fool myself.\n\nI felt empty inside, like my soul had left my body. That was the first time I realized I was depressed. And it set off a series of appointments, medications, treatments, hospitalizations, and battles to get me to where I am today. I had already been in therapy, but after that day, I took another step. I went on Wellbutrin, hoping it would crack through the shell of emptiness.\n\nWhen my psychiatrist wrote me that first prescription in 2015, I remember asking her if she thought I'd need to be on it for a long time. No, she said, I think maybe six months or so—just to get you through this patch. It turned out to be just one step in a journey to treating my ongoing depression.\n\n**Facing the Reality of Depression**\n\nDepression is sneaky, until it's not. When my psychiatrist told me she thought I'd be on Wellbutrin for six months or so, I took it to heart. But several factors—both controllable and not-made that unrealistic. Neither of us could have predicted that just four months after that conversation, my mom would be diagnosed with ovarian cancer.\n\nThat she would die less than two years later. I felt empty inside, like my soul had left my body. That was the first time I realized I was depressed. Or that inside of six months in 2017, I would also lose my job, have to give up my dog, and experience the breakup of a summer fling.\n\nA perfect storm for someone struggling with depression. We also didn't know at the time the depth of mental illness in my genetics, thanks to adoption. She didn't yet know the depth of how much I was drinking...because I didn't tell her. The combination of these risk factors really created the perfect storm, and, twice, I put myself in the eye of the storm by chasing several drinks with a handful of pills in an attempt to escape the pain.\n\n**The Struggle is Ongoing**\n\nAfter the second suicide attempt, I realized nothing changes if nothing changes, and I checked myself in for six weeks of inpatient treatment. Intellectually, I knew that six weeks of intensive therapy wouldn't cure me...but that doesn't mean I didn't hope that deep down.\n\nAlthough I was nervous about rejoining the real world, I also felt my stomach drop as we filled out depression relapse prevention sheets as part of our discharge plans. It was in that stomach drop that I realized that this is something I might be managing for a long time...or even the rest of my life.\n\n**The Struggle is Not Just About Me**\n\nIf My Parents Stayed in Hong Kong, I May Not Be Alive Today\n\nEverything You Need Is Inside You\n\nIt took a long time and a lot of pain to learn this one, but maybe the most transformative realization is that everything I need is inside me. I wrote the words everything I need is inside me over and over again in a notebook in my loopy cursive in treatment, willing them to imprint on my brain.\n\nI even thought about getting a tattoo, in hopes that literally imprinting the words on me would help them seep into my brain. But it took time and repetition—and sometimes I forget even today. My journey to that realization, though, was peppered with desperately looking for a magic bullet that would help me.\n\n**The Struggle is Not Just About Me**\n\nI looked ANYWHERE but inside for so long. Grasping for any straws, hoping that it was just an equation I had to solve, and that if I found the right variable, I would solve it! It would be fine!\n\nIt took a long time and a lot of pain to learn this one, but maybe the most transformative realization is that everything I need is inside me. But I'm a writer and therapist, not a mathematician, so this was a faulty equation.\n\nOh, the way I tried, though. I hopped on every wellness trend—from goat yoga, to healing crystals, to sound baths. I frantically texted everyone I knew, hoping they'd have some secret answer that would be a game-changer for me.\n\n**Self-Compassion is Key**\n\nDon't Be An A**hole to Yourself\n\nAs much as I just said that there's no magic bullet—Dr. Kristin Neff's self-compassion work has really stayed with me. If you're anything like me, the voice in your head is probably far more harsh to you than anyone else will ever be.\n\nA New Yorker at heart, I thought being nice to myself was something I didn't have time for. How would I ever get everything I wanted to get done without yelling at myself? Since losing my mom, all I've wanted is just for someone to tell me that 'it will all be OK, sweetie.'\n\nThe truth is that nobody else telling me that will ever carry as much weight as a mom telling you that, but the other truth is that I do have someone with me all the time who can tell me that—me. Our bodies respond to these internal self-attacks1 the same way they do to a verbal attack from someone else—or even how they respond to a physical attack.\n\n**Self-Compassion Makes Life More Manageable**\n\nYou Have to Be Honest-With Yourself and Others\n\nSeveral days before I left for inpatient treatment, one of my friends said to me, You know, you need to not try to outsmart this therapist. My face flushed with indignancy. She wasn't in the room with us! What did she know?!\n\nSo much, dear reader, so much. And as my therapist began to rip my soul bare, I saw what she meant. I had been so afraid to tell anyone about some of the emotions and actions I was most ashamed of.\n\nThe convenient thing about the self-medicating I was doing with alcohol and benzos is that you lose any self-awareness. I've blocked out much of 2018, when my depression was the worst, in part because it's too painful to remember how I felt, and in part, because I carry a lot of shame for how I acted when I had no idea how I was acting when I was desperately trying to escape my feelings.\n\n**Facing Feelings**\n\nWe have enough external stimuli attacking us in different ways—why also do that to ourselves? I was so scared to be myself. A person who had a range of BIG feelings—including the socially unacceptable ones. The ones a woman shouldn't have. Jealousy, anger, pettiness, etc.\n\nI've been writing about my mental health on the internet since my first",

    "content": "**Causes of Treatment-Resistant Depression**\n\n**Brain & Body Risk Factors**\n\nLet's take a look at some of the factors that may precede treatment-resistant depression.\n\n1. Other Underlying Health Issues\n*   Depression can be comorbid with certain physical conditions, such as heart disease, gastrointestinal problems, and hypertension.\n*   Treatment-resistant depression has been strongly associated with chronic non-cancer pain conditions.\n2. Mental health conditions\n*   Such as eating disorders, substance abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, and personality disorders\n3. Metabolic Abnormalities\n*   Clinical investigations have determined that nutritional deficiencies and metabolic disorders can play a role in treatment-resistant depression.\n4. Brain & Body Risk Factors\n\n**Family History & Genetics**\n\n*   It is well established that individuals with a family history of depression have a higher likelihood of developing clinical depression themselves over the course of their lifetime.\n*   Studies have made this connection for clinical depression as a whole, but there has not been much examination of the family history risk factors for treatment-resistant depression specifically.\n\n**Lifestyle Risk Factors**\n\nSome lifestyle factors can put you at risk for treatment-resistant depression. These include:\n\n1.  Misdiagnosis\n2.  Problems with medication:\n    *   Antidepressants can take up to six weeks to work.\n    *   Individuals often stop taking a drug too early, before the medication has time to take full effect.\n    *   Some people may also skip doses or stop medications prematurely due to unpleasant side effects.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nTreatment-resistant depression is not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).\n\n**Treatment**\n\nApproximately 20% to 40% of individuals with major depression do not exhibit an adequate clinical improvement with antidepressants.\n\n1.  How Your Doctor Determines If Treatment Has Failed:\n    *   The level of compliance with the current treatment regimen\n    *   The amount of time you took the medication\n    *   The dosage\n2.  Alternative treatments for treatment-resistant depression include vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and ketamine.\n\n**Coping With Treatment-Resistant Depression**\n\nDealing with treatment-resistant depression can be challenging. If you are dealing with treatment-resistant depression, here's what you can do to cope:\n\n*   Prioritize self-care.\n*   Manage your stress.\n*   Ditch drugs and alcohol.\n*   Adhere to your treatment plan.\n\n**Can Depression Go Away on Its Own?**\n\nRead More: CONDITIONS A-Z DEPRESSION CAUSES 15 Sources By Brina Patel Share Feedback  **References**\n\n1.

    "content": "What It Means to Have Clinical Depression The symptoms go beyond feelings of sadness By Hannah Owens, LMSW Updated on September 27, 2024 Medically reviewed by Steven Gans, MD Guido Mieth Getty Images Table of Contents Symptoms of Clinical Depression Suicidal Ideation Types of Clinical Depression Causes and Risk Factors Diagnosis of Clinical Depression Treatment Options Coping Strategies and Support My Personal Experiences with Depression The term depression gets thrown around a lot these days. But what's the difference between feeling blue and having clinical depression? Depression is a mental health disorder characterized by episodes of persistent low mood. Most of the time, clinical depression refers to major depressive disorder. But there are other types of depression too, such as bipolar depression, seasonal affective disorder (SAD), formally diagnosed as major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern, and postpartum depression, now formally diagnosed as major depressive disorder with peripartum onset - to name a few. Read on to learn more about the symptoms, types, and causes of clinical depression, as well as treatments available to tackle this common but nefarious condition. Symptoms of Clinical Depression One of the well known symptoms of clinical depression is episodes of pervasive sadness. But you might not know that there are other significant symptoms of depression. In fact, there is a whole litany of symptoms that affect not just your mood but your sleep, your body, and how you think and behave. Mood Depression can change your mood in myriad ways. Along with sadness, you might experience a loss of interest in things that used to bring you pleasure-this is called anhedonia. Suddenly, your favorite TV show can't hold your attention, or you no longer get a boost of endorphins after your favorite running route. You might experience your life as flat. You might also feel hopeless, like nothing will ever improve, or you could feel overwhelmingly and inappropriately guilty about things that, ordinarily, would not warrant that level of guilt. In addition, you might experience a general sense of apathy-things don't matter to you like they used to, and it might feel hard to get motivated at work or to pursue your hobbies. Anxiety also often goes hand-in-hand with depression. The combination of persistent worry and rumination with symptoms like low mood, anhedonia, and hopelessness can be a match made in hell. Sleep Another key element of clinical depression is how it affects your sleep. You might find that you are oversleeping or not sleeping enough-both can be signs of depression. Specifically, early awakening is common in those with depression. You might find yourself consistently waking up in the wee hours of the morning and not being able to fall back asleep. Insomnia and restless sleep-the inability to fall asleep and waking up over and over throughout the night-can also be hallmarks of depression. Ironically, getting enough sleep, and enough restful sleep at that, is one key to managing depression, making these symptoms that much more insidious. Body Depression can affect your appetite, causing you to behave in uncharacteristic ways. You might suddenly feel ravenous all the time, as though your hunger can never be satiated no matter how much you eat; or you might lose your appetite completely. Associated with these are changes to your body-you might gain or lose a lot of weight unintentionally. Other physical symptoms might include fatigue or, on the other side of the coin, restlessness. Feeling overly tired or overly activated can also be signs of depression. Cognition and Behavior Depression can make it feel difficult or impossible to think. You might feel slow, like you're mentally wading through Jell-O, or like your brain is filled with cotton and you can't create or connect cogent thoughts. You also might have difficulty paying attention. These symptoms can make everyday tasks like work or school especially hard. You or your loved ones might also notice changes in your behavior due to depression. You might suddenly be easily irritated, or have frequent crying spells. You might often feel agitated, even when there's nothing to be agitated about. Friends and family might notice that you are isolating yourself so that you don't have to be social (which can feel particularly difficult when dealing with depression). Suicidal Ideation One of the most severe and challenging symptoms of depression is suicidality. If you're depressed, you might feel as though there is nothing worth living for. Or, it can even go beyond that, with an inexplicable but overwhelming urge to die. These feelings don't make sense to someone who is not experiencing them, and they can be the most difficult attributes of depression to talk about. You might feel ashamed or embarrassed for feeling suicidal, or you might feel as though you don't want to burden your loved ones with these feelings. It is important to recognize these suicidal thoughts as a treatable symptom of your depression and reach out for help immediately. If you or someone you care about is having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 988 Types of Clinical Depression Clinical depression doesn't just refer to one singular condition. There are many different types of depression, associated with many different disorders. Major Depressive Disorder (Unipolar Depression) When someone says clinically depressed, major depressive disorder, or MDD, is usually what they mean. This is also known as unipolar (as opposed to bipolar ) depression. According to the DSM 5 (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), in order to be diagnosed with MDD, you must be experiencing at least five of the following criteria: Depressed mood Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all activities Significant and unintentional weight loss or weight gain Sleep disturbance (insomnia or hypersomnia) Observable agitation or retardation (noticeable by others) Fatigue, tiredness, or loss of energy Feeling worthless or feeling excessive or delusional guilt Impaired ability to concentrate, think, or make decisions Recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts In addition to these criteria, the following must also be true of your depressive symptoms: They cause significant distress and impairment in everyday life-professionally, socially, and or at home They're not better explained by medication side effects, drug use, or another medical condition You've never experienced a manic or hypomanic episode (which would indicate bipolar disorder rather than MDD) Your symptoms aren't better explained by schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder (such as schizoaffective disorder, which also involves mood symptoms) If you feel like you meet these requirements for MDD, talk to a psychiatrist or mental health professional about how you're feeling. Bipolar Depression Depressive episodes are also a significant part of bipolar disorder. In this condition, you experience mood swings, from depression to mania or hypomania. Bipolar depression meets the same criteria for depression as MDD, but a person must have experienced at least one manic or hypomanic episode-people with MDD do not experience mania or hypomania. Psychotic Depression Psychotic depression, also called depressive psychosis, or formally in the DSM major depressive disorder with psychotic features, is depression that is accompanied by psychotic symptoms. With psychotic depression, you might experience delusions (fixed false beliefs), hallucinations (false sensory perceptions), or disorganization where it can be difficult to think or communicate clearly. One key difference between psychotic depression and other psychotic disorders is that, in psychotic depression, the psychosis is only present during the depressive episode; in other conditions, like schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, you continue to have psychotic symptoms even when not in a depressive episode. Postpartum Depression Many people write off postpartum depression as the baby blues, but it is actually much more severe than that. Postpartum depression describes a clinical depressive episode that occurs after the birth of a baby. In the DSM-5, major depressive disorder with peripartum onset is actually defined as a major depressive episode occurring during pregnancy as well as in the four weeks following delivery. However, many clinicians extend that period to include the first year after birth. If left untreated, postpartum depression can negatively affect your the relationship with your newborn, interfering with bonding and potentially having significant long term impacts on the child. As with other types of depression, there can be an increased risk for suicide in the mother. If this describes you, reach out for professional help and support as soon as you can. Postpartum depression is a treatable clinical condition, and should be treated as such. Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) Premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or PMDD, is a very real depressive condition that is often dismissed as just part of your period -although it's anything but. Like MDD, PMDD has its own specific diagnostic criteria. In the week before your period, there must be at least one of these symptoms: Mood swings, crying spells, and emotional sensitivity Marked anger, irritability, or increased interpersonal conflict Depressed mood, hopelessness, or self-deprecating thoughts Increased anxiety, tension, or the feeling of being on edge Some of the following symptoms must also be present, to create a total of five when combined with the above criteria: Anhedonia or decreased interest in activities Difficulty concentrating Lethargy, easily fatigued, or lack of energy Changes in appetite, including overeating or specific cravings Insomnia or hypersomnia Feeling overwhelmed or out of control Physical symptoms like breast swelling or tenderness, muscle or joint pain, or bloating If this describes your period, you shouldn't have to suffer in silence. It's a real mood disorder and deserves real treatment. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) Seasonal affective disorder-appropriately shortened to SAD -is a major depressive condition that begins and ends with the changing seasons. People with SAD experience clinical depression (the symptoms of MDD) that correlate exclusively to seasonal shifts, with all symptoms persisting throughout one season and remitting completely when that season is over. (For most people, this occurs in winter, but it can be experienced in summer as well.) In order to be diagnosed with SAD, you need to have experienced major depressive symptoms during this season and only this season for at least two years, and over the course of a lifetime, you need to have had more seasonal depressive episodes than not. Essentially, a SAD diagnosis establishes a consistent pattern of seasonal depression. Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthemia) Persistent depressive disorder-previously known as dysthymia - is where, over the course of at least two years, someone will have a depressed mood most days or for most of the day. They'll also experience at least two of the following criteria: Insomnia or hypersomnia Poor appetite or overeating Feelings of hopelessness Fatigue or low energy levels Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions Low self-esteem Having persistent depressive disorder also means that you're not without depressive symptoms for more than two months out of the year- hence, persistent. A lot of the qualifiers for this disorder are the same as for MDD: for instance, it can't be better explained by a drug reaction or physical condition, there's never been mania or hypomania, there's no psychotic disorder, and it causes significant distress and disruption in everyday life. In addition, your symptoms can't be more accurately attributed to MDD or partially remitted MDD. Situational Depression Sometimes, dealing with a stressful or traumatic event can make us feel depressed; however, when this depression is specific to a certain situation and does not meet criteria for a mental health condition, it's not considered clinical depression. In fact, the technical term for situational depression is adjustment disorder with depressed mood. This describes marked distress or difficulty handling or coping with a stressful event that results in short-term depressive symptoms. If you have situational depression, you might feel overly sad, angry, or irritated; your sleep and appetite might be disrupted; carrying out daily tasks might feel difficult or impossible. But the key to situational depression is that these symptoms dissipate in time as you get further from the initiating event or its consequences. Atypical Depression Atypical depression, or major depressive disorder with atypical features, is a subtype of depression characterized by mood reactivity (your moods can change in the face of environmental circumstances) and the atypical features of increased sleep, increased appetite, leaden paralysis which is an extreme type of fatigue, and interpersonal rejection sensitivity. An atypical diagnosis can be applied to MDD, bipolar depression, and persistent depressive disorder. 7 Common Types of Depression Causes and Risk Factors Clinical depression doesn't stem from just one source or risk factor-it describes a wide variety of complicated conditions affected by many things, including genetics, your environment, and biology. Genetic Factors It's been found that certain genes have been linked to a higher prevalence of clinical depression, and if you have those genes, you're more likely to develop a depressive disorder. However, it's difficult to narrow down specific genes that cause depression because many people with mental illnesses are affected by many different genes ( polygenic sources) that contribute to their conditions.1 It has been proven, however, that depressive disorders are, in some instances, highly heritable-this means that having relatives who have depressive disorders means the likelihood of you having one increases.2 The emergence of depression can be influenced not just by your DNA, but by epigenetics, or how those genes get expressed. Adverse life events and environmental exposures have been shown to affect your epigenetics.1 Environmental Factors There are also elements of your environment that can make you more susceptible to mental illnesses like depression. Experiencing adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs, when you were young can increase your risk of depression-these things include child abuse or neglect and stressful life experiences like divorce or domestic violence. Your socioeconomic status can also affect your risk of depression. Being raised in a low-income household can have negative effects on your mental well-being as a child that can be carried with you to adulthood. In addition, being a victim of prejudice, bigotry, and racism can negatively affect your mental health, and make it more likely that you will at some point experience depression. Biological Factors While genetics are certainly a biological contribution to depression, there are many other factors that can play a role. In particular, physical co-occurring health conditions can greatly increase your chance of experiencing depression. Not only can chronic illnesses affect your physical health, their biological and emotional effects can increase your risk for depression. People who experience persistent or chronic stress are also more likely to develop depression. This is in some degree due to the dysregulation long term effects of stress has on the HPA system, or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis - the stress regulation system in the body. It's no wonder that stress on the body results in stress on the mind.3 Some Common Causes of Depression Co-Occurring Conditions People living with depression often have co-occurring mental health conditions. The most common of these is anxiety. This can be as the anxiety symptoms that often accompany depressive disorders, as well as co-occurring anxiety disorders, Many depressive and anxiety symptoms overlap-for instance, both conditions can be characterized by irritability, rumination, difficulty concentrating or making decisions, and trouble sleeping. But it is also not uncommon for those with anxiety disorders such as panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder or social phobia to also have a depressive disorder. It's also possible for people with different kinds of mental illnesses to experience depression as well. Someone with schizophrenia, a psychotic disorder, or a personality disorder like borderline personality disorder might also experience episodes of a major depressive disorder. Causes and Risk Factors of Depression Diagnosis of Clinical Depression Getting diagnosed with a form of clinical depression begins by getting an assessment by a mental health or medical professional, and can be quite straightforward. A psychiatrist, a psychologist, or a licensed clinical social worker can provide a diagnosis. Besides evaluating you for the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria we discussed earlier, there are other assessments that your provider can use to help with a diagnosis. There is no [formal] diagnostic assessment that is required to diagnose depression, but many exist that can help determine if symptoms are present, explains Amy Marschall, PsyD. Technically all that is needed is a diagnostic interview with a provider, and if that provider determines that there is enough information and evidence that symptoms are present, they can issue a diagnosis. However, she explains, they might use screening tools with cutoff scores, which can indicate whether symptoms are causing significant distress, or norm-referenced tools, which can provide information on how significant the symptoms are compared to the general population. Initial Assessment Two of the most common depression assessment tools are the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire). The BDI is a 21-question, multiple-choice quiz that relies on self-reporting of possible depressive symptoms. It evaluates the presence of certain symptoms and their severity based on your ratings from 0 to 3, with 0 signifying no presence of that symptom to 3 signifying the symptom at its worst. For example, the first question is about sadness, with answers ranging from I do not feel sad (0) to I am so sad and unhappy that I can't stand it (3). The BDI is meant for people ages 13 to 80, and requires a 6th-grade reading level in order to properly understand and fill out the questionnaire. The comprehensiveness of this inventory means it takes about 10 minutes to complete. The PHQ-9 is also a self-reporting measure designed to determine the presence and seriousness of depressive symptoms, but it is much shorter than the BDI (nine questions rather than 21-hence, the 9 in PHQ-9 ). The PHQ-9 also has you rate your symptoms from 0 to 3, but in terms of frequency rather than severity. For example, the first symptom you are asked to describe is little interest or pleasure in doing things, with answers ranging from Not at all (0) to Several days (1) to More than half the days (2) to Nearly every day (3). For both assessments, your score from each question is tallied and the range of your total score represents a certain level of depression. In the BDI, the lowest score means these ups and downs are considered normal and the highest score means extreme depression; in the PHQ-9, the lowest score means minimal depression and the highest score means severe depression. There are also specific depression assessments designed to measure depression both before and after treatment (the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), depression in children (such as the Children's Depression Inventory, based on the BDI), and depression in older adults (the Geriatric Depression Scale). Differential Diagnosis A differential diagnosis is the process of distinguishing your symptoms from the symptoms of other conditions when those symptoms overlap. For depression, a differential diagnosis would involve ruling out other psychiatric disorders, such as: Anxiety disorders Obsessive compulsive disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder Personality disorders Symptoms of physical conditions must also be ruled out, such as: Sleep disorders Parkinson's, MS, dementia, and other central nervous system disorders Drug use and misuse or side effects from medication Thyroid issues (hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism) Infectious diseases Treatment Options There are many ways to manage and treat clinical depression, including medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes. Medication Medications that treat depression are called antidepressants (although they are also commonly used to treat anxiety and other disorders as well), and there are many kinds that work on different mechanisms in the brain. The most common kinds are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), atypical antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). SSRIs are the most prescribed medications for depression. They allow for more serotonin to be passed from neuron to neuron in the brain. SSRIs include: Prozac (fluoxetine) Celexa (citalopram) Zoloft (sertraline) Lexapro (escitalopram) Paxil (paroxetine) SNRIs work similarly to SSRIs, but impact both serotonin and norepinephrine, and are commonly prescribed for depression as well as anxiety disorders. SNRIs include: Cymbalta (duloxetine) Effexor (venlafaxine) Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) Fetzima (levomilnacipran) TCAs also affect the reabsorption of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, as well as impacting other neurotransmitters. These were some of the first antidepressants and tend to come with more side-effects than the SSRI, SNRI and atypical antidepressants. Along with depression, TCAs can be used to treat insomnia, anxiety, and chronic pain. TCAs include: Amitriptyline Norpramin (desipramine) Tofranil (imipramine) Pamelor (nortriptyline) Amoxepin Doxepin Protriptyline Trimipramine Atypical antidepressants are called so because they do not function like these other types of antidepressants, and instead work differently on the neurotransmitter systems in the brain. Atypical antidepressants include: Wellbutrin (bupropion) Remeron (mirtazapine) Desyrel (trazodone) MAOIs were the first type of antidepressants ever developed, and can be quite effective, but currently are rarely prescribed as the newer kinds of antidepressants cause fewer side effects and are generally considered to be safer. Specifically, people taking MAOIs must follow a strict restrictive diet and avoid certain medications because of potentially serious interactions. MAOIs include: Emsam (selegiline) Nardil (phenelzine) Marplan (isocarboxazid) Parnate (tranylcypromine) It is important to bear in mind that, like any psychotropic medication, there are possible side effects when taking antidepressants. Common ones include: Agitation and anxiety Nausea and stomach pain Diarrhea or constipation Insomnia Headaches Loss of sex drive, inability to orgasm, or erectile dysfunction Loss of appetite Dizziness Weight gain Drowsiness Heart problems like palpitations or a fast heartbeat Most of these side effects dissipate over time, but if they persist or are unbearable, talk to your psychiatrist. You don't need to put up with side effects if they are making you miserable. Be aware that some rare side effects can be medically serious, such as: Serotonin syndrome (too much serotonin in the brain) usually caused when serotonin antidepressants are used with other agents that impact serotonin Hyponatraemia (low salt levels that can impact the brain) Increased risk of bleeding (particularly when used with anticoagulants) In addition, there has been a reported association with some antidepressants and increased suicidal ideation, especially in children, teenagers and young adults. If you are feeling suicidal, contact your doctor immediately. Psychotherapy Therapy is a great option for those living with clinical depression. There are a wide range of approaches and modalities that have been proven effective in the treatment of depression, so you're sure to find one that works for you. The most important aspect of treating depression with psychotherapy is finding the right therapist. Don't be afraid of trying out different providers until you find one you really click with. Common therapeutic approaches for treating depression include: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): Considered a gold standard in the treatment of depression, CBT teaches you to recognize and change maladaptive (harmful) thoughts, behaviors and coping strategies. It is important to recognize that, while you may not have the power to control what happens to you in life, you do have the power to control your reactions to what happens. Psychoanalysis: This modality focuses on experiences in your life, past and present, and your unconscious thoughts, habits, and motivations that may be contributing to your depression. Although formal psychoanalysis (several times a week on the couch) is less common nowadays, the principles involved (psychodynamic psychotherapy) are commonly employed in a variety of psychotherapeutic approaches and can be quite helpful in people better understanding themselves and growing in capacities that can mitigate depression. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT): A spin-off of CBT, ACT teaches you to accept your feelings, thoughts, and reactions to emotional triggers rather than avoiding them, trying to change them, or acting on them. This allows you to stop judging yourself for your depressive symptoms, and then focuses on using your values to guide your actions in your life. Dr. Marschall weighs in about the most common approach, CBT: Cognitive behavioral therapy has a lot of research behind it as an effective tool for treating depression, although this is partially because cognitive behavioral therapy is one of the easiest modalities to implement in a research setting, she explains. Basically, a therapist trained in CBT can help someone who is experiencing depression recognize how their thoughts and perception of the world around them might perpetuate depressive symptoms. For example, CBT techniques can help you catch negative self-talk reflecting harmful beliefs, like thinking, 'I am a failure,' after making a small mistake. Alternative and Complementary Therapies Although medication and psychotherapy are the mainstays of managing depression, there are a few complementary alternative approaches that have been proven to be helpful. Regular exercise has been proven to lessen depressive symptoms, for example.4 Yoga and mindfulness-based practices have also been shown to be helpful in managing depression,56 Each of these interventions can be used in conjunction with talk therapy and medication to supplement your depression treatment. In fact, they're recommended-but it's always best to seek out professional help as well. You might see acupuncture as a recommended alternative therapy for depression, but multiple studies have questioned its efficacy.7 In addition, St. John's Wort is sometimes recommended as an alternative to medication, but its effectiveness is not reliable; it also interferes with the efficacy of certain prescription medications, and can even result in serious health conditions (like serotonin syndrome) if taken alongside some kinds of antidepressants.2 Self-Care and Lifestyle Changes Everyone has different self-care needs, says Dr. Marschall, but an important starting point is ensuring that your basic physical needs are met. Depression is like carrying around an enormous invisible weight that makes every activity more difficult even if there is not a clear, visible reason why these challenges have arisen. Many people experiencing a depressive episode will struggle with eating, hygiene, and other basic tasks, explains Dr. Marschall. Not only can this be bad for your physical health, but it can create a vicious cycle. It's hard to come out of feeling depressed when you feel unclean from not showering for several days. When someone has very limited energy due to depression, I encourage them to keep things very basic. If you do not have the capacity for your full hygiene, for example, try to at least brush your teeth because dental care is tied to so many health issues, Dr. Marschall suggests. Can't do a whole two minutes? That is fine, just brush for 30 seconds, or use Listerine to protect yourself from other health consequences. There are also lifestyle changes that have been proven to help day-to-day symptoms. Incorporating exercise into your daily routine is an important and effective way to help you manage your depression. Not only does it produce immediate endorphins, boosting your current mood, but a healthier body supports a healthier mind in the long run. Starting a meditation or mindfulness practice can also help with mood symptoms. Taking the time each day to focus on what's going on inside of you can help you identify your current mood state and tackle challenges and symptoms head-on. Meditation can also help you calm your mind and think more carefully about what you need in order to feel your best that day. Bedtime routines are also helpful. Make sure you have good sleep hygiene: wind down before bed by weaning yourself off your screens and devices, and try to go to bed at the same time every night and wake up at the same time every morning. The most important aspect of self-care when dealing with depression, though, is not to judge yourself when you're experiencing symptoms. If you need to take a break at work, take a break; if you need a mental health day, respect that feeling and take the day off. The world isn't going to fall apart if you're out of commission for the day. Do things that normally boost your mood-go for a walk, watch your favorite TV show, go to the dog park and pet some dogs. Even if you can't feel better today, that's ok. You have the emotional flu-so treat yourself with the kindness you would if you had the actual flu. Can Depression Go Away on Its Own? Coping Strategies and Support There are lots of things you can do to cope with depression, both daily and in the long term. To begin, Dr. Marschall advises paying close attention to your emotional patterns. Noticing when you are starting to enter an episode is important. Since your brain's job is to give you information about the world around you, it does not always accurately cue you to what it is experiencing in the moment, she says. It's kind of like when my former employer's contact button broke on their website, and no one could find contact information to let them know that the link had broken. If you document what signs you experience at the start of an episode, you can get support before things get worse. Building a Support Network Make sure you have people around you whom you trust. This might be family members, friends, or coworkers-anyone you know you can talk to when you're feeling low. Being able to be honest with the people around you, especially loved ones, can keep you from feeling isolated in your depression. Suffering in silence doesn't help anyone. You might not feel as though the people around you will understand how you're feeling, and you might be right-they might not be able to completely understand. But chances are they'd like to. Chances are you have people in your life who want to be there to support you, through better or worse. Practice talking about your depression. Making it less scary to talk about your symptoms means more people will know what you're going through and can offer themselves as a source of support. Managing Daily Life Routines are very helpful for people with depression. Having stability and a plan for the day can help ensure that if and when depressive symptoms do arise, you can deal with them without having to worry about throwing off your entire life. Make sure you eat, even if you don't feel like it. Get some form of exercise, even if it's just going for a short walk. Talk to someone. If you're feeling bad and want to talk it through, do it. If you don't want to talk about how you're feeling, that's fine too. Send a stupid meme to your bestie. Remind yourself that you have people around you if you need them. If you're having a particularly hard day, it's ok to stay in bed for just that day. It's ok if the only exercise you get that day is moving from the bed to the couch. It's ok if the only thing you feel like eating is Cheetos. Be kind to yourself. However, if this becomes a pattern, it should be discussed with your mental health professional. My Partner and I Both Have Depression, Now What? Long-Term Management In the long run, it's especially important to maintain consistent treatment. Working with a therapist is a great way to manage your depression-don't get discouraged if the work you're doing in therapy is difficult or you feel like you're not making progress fast enough. Trust the system, trust your therapist, and trust yourself. (Though if you have been in therapy for a long time and are not noticing any changes or feeling supported in your therapy, it might be time for a consultation or to switch therapists.) If you and your providers have decided that you need medication in order to treat your depression, make sure you are taking it consistently the way it is prescribed. It might take you a few tries or combinations to get on the right medication-take note of how you are feeling day-to-day, and let your providers know if you start feeling worse. Don't feel like you have to settle for just feeling ok. Maintain interpersonal connections. Make sure you are talking to friends on a regular basis, even if it's just a text here and there to check in. Having a strong support system is imperative in living with and managing depression. My Personal Experiences with Depression I have been dealing with some form of clinical depression since I was in high school. At first, I was misdiagnosed with unipolar depression, then bipolar disorder; as it turns out, I have schizoaffective disorder, which is characterized by both mood symptoms (like depression and mania) and psychotic symptoms that persist even when one is not is a mood episode. I have been on upwards of 30 different medications over the past 20-ish years. My first experience with an antidepressant was in high school. I tried Celexa, and within two weeks I was experiencing suicidal ideation (sometimes antidepressants can have destabilizing effects, particularly in those with bipolar vulnerabilities). Next, in college, was Wellbutrin, which I was on for a few years until a psychotic break landed me in the hospital and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. After that, I was put on lithium, which is a go-to mood stabilizer for people with bipolar. Still, I was having regular depressive episodes that lasted months, some so bad that they catapulted me into suicidality. In my depressed states, it's difficult to think-it feels like I am on a permanent delay while the world rushes past me at twice its normal speed. To this day, that is how I experience my depressive episodes. There's also a deep sadness that descends over me that's not related to a situation or a problem; it's just there, like a weighted blanket I do not want or need, pushing me down. There have been times when I physically could not move, I was so depressed. I've laid on my bed or on the couch, immobile with pain. There have been times I haven't eaten for days, weeks where I couldn't sleep or slept far too much. I feel my depression in my chest-a gaping hole where my ribcage should be. Although my mood symptoms are now, finally, under control, I still occasionally get depressed, even severely depressed. The episodes tend to end more quickly, and I haven't felt suicidal in a very long time-all wins in my book. But I recognize that depression will most likely be a major part of my life for the rest of my life. I also recognize that my depression doesn't have to define me, or keep me from living the way I want to. 6 Things People Get Wrong About Depression, From a Therapist Conclusion There are many different types of clinical depression-major depressive disorder, bipolar depression, and postpartum depression, to name a few-and a myriad of ways to treat them. Talk therapy can help you deal with your depressive symptoms as they arise, and antidepressant and other medications can make your depression more manageable or even disappear. Lifestyle changes can also help with depression-for example, regular exercise and a stable support system are invaluable when dealing with depressive symptoms. If you are feeling depressed, you don't need to suffer in silence. If you are already in therapy, talk to your therapist about how you are feeling; if you already have a psychiatrist, explain to them what you are experiencing. If you need to find a provider to help treat your depression, online therapy is an accessible and affordable option. Look for a company that specializes in treating depression. Online therapy companies and online therapy directories can connect you with mental healthcare providers who can treat depression and might even take your insurance, making their services that much more feasible. If you are feeling suicidal or in crisis, there are emergency resources for you: 988: The Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. Dial or text 988 to be connected to emergency mental health services. However, bear in mind that, if you are determined to be a danger to yourself or others, the police might get involved as first responders. The Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741 to be connected anonymously to a crisis text line volunteer. Depression doesn't have to be your end-all, be-all. Don't be afraid to reach out for help if you are depressed.

Sedentary lifestyle\n5.  Poor diet\n\n**Diagnosing the Causes of Lethargy**\n\nIf you can't seem to shake the feeling of lethargy, ensure that you're getting enough restful sleep and avoid sedatives. If symptoms persist, visit your primary care doctor.\n\nSteps your healthcare provider may take:\n\n1.  Take a complete personal and family medical history\n2.  Ask about when you started noticing the lethargy, what it feels like, and what other symptoms you are experiencing\n3.  Review any medications you are taking\n4.  Determine whether you are using any substances\n5.  Perform a physical exam and run some tests\n\n**Treating the Causes of Lethargy**\n\nIf the lethargy is related to sleep disruptions, work toward building a consistent routine with adequate restful sleep.\n\nIf the lethargy is caused by another health condition, it's essential to treat the underlying cause.

Adjust your schedule: Try to adjust your schedule-and your expectations-to accommodate shorter bouts of activity, so you can take breaks and get some rest.\n2.  Inform loved ones: Speak to your family and let them know how you're feeling, so they understand that your low energy levels and lack of participation are not a result of disinterest.\n3.  Get some exercise: Paradoxically, exercise can help increase your energy levels. Start with whatever you can do, even a little at a time, such as a 10-minute walk every day.\n4.  Avoid substances: Refrain from quick fixes and substances like alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, or other drugs.\n5.  Maintain a healthy routine: Work on maintaining a consistent and balanced daily routine, with a reasonable work and personal schedule, adequate sleep, and a nutritious diet.",

    "content": "Last medically reviewed on December 06, 2023 \nHere is the content with Markdown formatting:\n\n**Why You Feel Like You Need a Hug From Someone**\n\nUnderstanding the power, and psychology, of a hug\n\nBy Barbara Field\nUpdated on December 06, 2023\nReviewed by Steven Gans, MD\n\nHinterhaus Productions Getty Images\n\n**Table of Contents**\n1. Wire Mother Experiment\n2. Hugs Reduce Stress\n3. Hugs From Strangers vs. Loved Ones\n4. Hugs Increase Well-Being\n5. Hugs and Personal Conflict\n6. Hugs Boost Immune Response\n7. Give Yourself a Hug\n8. Keep in Mind\n\nIf you ever find yourself thinking, \"I want a hug,\" there are good reasons why.\n\nHugging has a relaxing and soothing effect on people.\n\nHugs are actually good for your health and science shows why hugs and touch are therapeutic.\n\n**At a Glance**\n\nIn his famous and controversial experiments, psychologists Harry Harlow revealed just how important physical contact is for mental wellness.\n\nHugs not only reduce stress, they also help increase happiness, boost immunity, reduce conflict, and improve overall well-being.\n\n**Research on the Psychology of Hugs**\n\nPsychologist Harry Harlow designed a study in which he took rhesus monkeys from their biological mothers.\n\nHe then offered two choices to the young monkeys:\n\n1. One choice was a terrycloth surrogate mother who gave no food.\n2. The other choice was a wire mother who provided food.\n\nInterestingly, the infant monkeys spent more time with the soft cloth mother even though she didn't provide sustenance.\n\nThe baby monkeys who fed at the wire mothers ate but then quickly returned to hold onto the cloth mother.\n\nScientists concluded that there is more to mother-child interactions than merely providing food.\n\nWhen you feel a need to be hugged, you want that same contact comfort.\n\nIt's the same type of comfort the monkeys in Harlow's experiment craved.\n\nIt's the same sort of comfort that infants want from their caregivers.\n\nIt's physically and emotionally crucial for an infant's psychological development.\n\nAs adults, getting that hug or tactile stimulation from someone we care about gives us a sense of closeness and well-being.\n\n**What Is Haphephobia?**\n\nHugs Reduce Stress and Increase Happiness\n\nNot everyone likes to be hugged or touched in the same way.\n\nBut generally, positive physical contact can effectively reduce your stress level and boost your mood.\n\nFeelings of loneliness and experiencing chronic stress can ultimately be harmful.\n\nHugs lower cortisol, which is sometimes called the stress hormone, in your body.\n\nHugs even lower blood pressure and heart rate.2\n\nAt the same time, a wonderful hug from a family member or friend will also bolster neurotransmitters such as dopamine in your system.\n\nDopamine is sometimes called the happiness hormone.\n\nHugs are one form of positive physical contact.\n\nOther forms include:\n\n*   Holding hands\n*   Being stroked\n*   Snuggling\n*   Getting therapeutic massages\n*   Nurturing touch during the early years helps our younger selves regulate emotions.\n\nWith high levels of loving hugs and physical contact, babies and toddlers develop in a healthy manner.\n\n**Hugs From Strangers and Loved Ones**\n\nCould hugs from a stranger even have positive benefits?\n\nIn a study published in a recent issue of Comprehensive Psychoneuroendocrinology, self-soothing touch and being hugged showed positive results even when strangers hugged.\n\nHugs reduced cortisol responses to stress and had calming effects.3\n\nHugs and touch acted as a type of social signal for safety.\n\nThey reduced fear and stress and gave participants a sense that all was well.\n\nScientists consider self-soothing touches and hugs to be potentially powerful ways to cushion an individual from stress and build resilience.\n\nBeing touched by a romantic partner would likely be even more pleasant than a hug from a stranger.\n\nBecause of the shared history, emotional closeness, and sexual intimacy a couple has together, a quick hug in the kitchen before one of you leaves for work could mean even more than a hug from someone you don't know well or at all.4\n\n**Physical Touch as a Love Language: What it Means**\n\nHugs Increase Well-Being\n\nBeing hugged uplifts our mood.\n\nIf you are feeling isolated or are going through a rough time, a hug releases endorphins.3\n\nEndorphins are the body's natural pain relievers.\n\nThese neurotransmitters increase our feelings of pleasure.\n\nThe release of endorphins is commonly associated with the after-effects of vigorous exercise.\n\nBut endorphins kick in through a variety of ways.\n\nThey are the happiness boosters that move us away from pain to pleasure.\n\nWhile it seems to be just a simple, loving gesture from a loved one, hugging also increases our level of oxytocin, the cuddle hormone. Oxytocin helps us bond with others and reduces the stress hormone, norepinephrine.5\n\nWhile hugging a family member or partner when we get home may seem like a small thing, healthy touch is like the glue that connects us.\n\nIt underpins our physical, psychological, and emotional well-being.\n\nHugs actually enhance our relationships and bonding with others.\n\n**Hugs and Personal Conflict**\n\nOur bonding with others is sometimes subject to conflict.\n\nHugs even help us during interpersonal conflict.\n\nIn a recent study, scientists interviewed 404 adults every night for 14 consecutive days specifically about their conflicts, hug receipt, and positive and negative affect. 6\n\nThe study's results aligned with its hypothesis that hugs buffer against harmful changes in our emotions when we experience interpersonal conflict.\n\nSurprisingly, the effects lasted even through the next day.\n\nA hug on a day of conflict with someone makes us feel good.\n\nBut the mere act of hugging actually improved the next day negative affect (i.e., your emotions).\n\n**Hugs Boost Immune Response**\n\nCan being hugged and hugging others affect our susceptibility to infectious disease?\n\nYes, according to scientists.\n\nBecause hugs lower our stress, they seem to carry a feeling of social support. In this recent study regarding upper respiratory infection, researchers examined the roles of perceived social support and received hugs in protecting us from stress-induced susceptibility to infectious disease.7\n\nResearchers exposed participants to a virus that causes a common cold.\n\nThey then monitored participants in quarantine to assess for signs of infection and illness.\n\nThey found that among infected participants, greater perceived support and more-frequent hugs each predicted less-severe illness signs.\n\n**Can You Give Yourself a Hug?**\n\nIf your partner or spouse is working in another city or your family and friends are scattered, you can't always get the physical contact you desire right now.\n\nYou might choose to hug yourself.\n\nYou can thereby give yourself that feeling of being secure and loved.\n\nIf your goal is to reduce the sense of touch hunger, hugging, self-stroking and massaging are excellent activities to accomplish that. Here are 6 suggested ways to self-soothe:\n\n1. Tell yourself positive things and give yourself a warm, strong hug.\n2. Place your hand over your heart and gently massage your heart.\n3. Softly massage your temples.\n4. Crisscross your arms and stroke the upper arms gently up and down.\n5. Put your hands on your shoulders and rock side to side.\n6. Rub your back against the",
