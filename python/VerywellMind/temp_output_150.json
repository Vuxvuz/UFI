Having close, positive relationships with colleagues is associated with increased well-being in the workplace, which should come as no surprise.1 If you've ever worked in a toxic workplace, which unfortunately many of us have, then you also know the intense toll negative workplace relationships can have. Workplace toxicity not only diminishes employee performance - it can also lead to burnout.2\n\nPart of the nuance of workplace relationships is the delicate balance of boundaries. Within the office, you're colleagues and peers. Outside the office, you may be close friends. Complications can arise when dynamics outside the workplace come into the office. Even in the most loving workplace relationships, when a dear friend and colleague struggles, you may feel hard-pressed for the right words.\n\nYou may have deep empathy and a hunger to support them, but might also be worried about an increased workload or stress being brought onto you. There is a way to maintain your care, connection, and heart in the workplace while respecting the boundaries of the workplace.\n\nHere are 20 ways to support your co-worker through a hard time:\n\n*   Do you want to talk?\n*   Is there any extra support you need?\n*   Would it be helpful if we redistributed our workload?\n*   This is a lot to carry alone.\n*   Do you have a therapist you can talk to?\n*   We love Inclusive Therapists and Open Path Collective.\n*   You deserve support. I can help you find the contact for the Employee Assistance Program.\n*   Do you want to bookend your chat with HR?\n*   Have you considered taking some time off?\n*   I'm worried about you.\n*   Just know I'm here for you.\n*   I see you and all your efforts.\n*   A job isn't worth your well-being.\n*   Want to get together outside of the office to connect?\n*   Let's see what your options are.\n*   Don't feel pressured to share what you're not ready to.\n*   What do you feel comfortable sharing?\n*   I've experienced something similar. Would it be helpful to hear my experience?\n*   Would you like advice or a listening ear?\n*   Your feelings are valid.\n*   Let's consider your options.\n*   You can serve as an unbiased sounding board.\n*   I hear you.\n\n**Sources**\n\n1.

Choosing to live apart together is a deliberate decision where both partners are committed to each other but prefer to maintain separate living spaces.\n\n*   Couples who prefer LAT like maintaining their routines and having personal space as they value their freedom and independence.\n*   It allows each partner to manage their own living environment while enjoying the emotional and physical intimacy of a committed relationship.\n*   The Relationship Doesn't Get Boring\n    *   People participate in the LAT model because it keeps the relationship new and fresh.\n    *   Many people get tired of their partners and feel less excited about them when they're together all the time.\n*   Some Partners Have Their Preferences and Quirks-Which Is OK\n    *   This relationship model is also a fit for other situations, too.\n    *   For example, your job is miles apart from your partner's home and you don't want a long commute to the office.\n\n**Challenges of Living Apart Together**\n\nOf course, the benefits of LAT come with a few challenges, namely social stigma, communication, and emotional distance.\n\n*   Social Stigma\n    *   People may ask them why they're not living together or when they're moving in together.\n    *   Suggest that their relationship must be struggling because they're not living together.\n*   Difficulty Finding Time Together Outside of social stigma, one of the biggest challenges of living apart in relationships is schedule coordination and communication.\n\n**Making LAT Work**\n\nIt takes some work to create a successful LAT relationship-any relationship, really-but it's completely possible. One first step is planning quality time, so the relationship stays connected.\n\n*   Planning dates ahead of time and sending spontaneous text messages (so they know you're thinking of them) are just a few small things to make your partner feel seen and appreciated.\n*   To prevent conflict avoidance, Reed recommends establishing communication and conflict rules on how arguments and discussions will be handled.\n\n**Considerations for Choosing LAT**\n\nThe first way to know if LAT is for you is if you, like me, wanted to live with partners in the past but disliked it. Think of past conflicts you've had in relationships and reflect on how many of them were related to sharing a living space, suggests Weiss.\n\n*   Consider your personal values, lifestyle preferences, and relationship intentionality when deciding to opt in or out of a LAT relationship.\n*   Also, consider the social stigma attached to LAT aka the belief that not living together implies a lack of commitment. If LAT relationships were more normalized, many relationships may actually last longer because the people in them would be less annoyed with each other and would have an easier time keeping the passion alive.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFor neurodivergent folks, people who enjoy their independence and autonomy, or individuals allergic to their partner's pets, LAT is a fine option for keeping and deepening romantic partnerships. It takes work like all relationships do. And yeah, unlike living together, you'll have to make more of an effort to communicate. But if you're happy with a partner, you don't have to live with them, especially if that doesn't sound like a great time. Instead, you can live apart together. I mean-if Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Burton could live apart for their 13-year marriage and still be happy, why can't you?

    "content": "on Article\n**Title**\nBehold, Your Reason to Date a Golden Retriever Boyfriend\n\n**Overview**\nHeyl discusses the idealized relationship archetype known as the \"Golden Retriever Boyfriend\" based on TikTok videos and explores its potential benefits and red flags.\n\n*   A Golden Retriever Boyfriend is outgoing, affectionate, and game for anything.\n*   They're also clingy and codependent on your presence to be happy.\n*   This relationship archetype emphasizes the importance of loyalty and a sunny disposition.\n\n**Qualities of a Golden Retriever Boyfriend**\n\n1.  A Golden Retriever Boyfriend is always ready to listen, has a deep sense of loyalty, and a smile that spreads across his face anytime he sees you.\n2.  They're outgoing, easily excited, and are game for doing silly things.\n3.  However, they can be overly clingy and codependent on your presence.\n\n**Benefits of Having a Golden Retriever Boyfriend**\n\n*   You'll have a warm, optimistic, loyal, kind, and appreciative partner.\n*   This relationship archetype emphasizes the importance of loyalty and a sunny disposition.\n\n**Things Aren't Always As They Seem**\n\n1.  Idealization can be problematic when we focus solely on the positive attributes of someone or something, leading us to minimize any negative qualities.\n2.  Nothing is all good nor all bad in relationships; insisting a relationship only has good qualities means overlooking reality.\n3.  This sets us up for disappointment and is unfair to our partner.\n\n**Red Flags to Watch Out for in a Golden Retriever Boyfriend**\n\n1.  If your partner relies only on you for social connection, isolation can occur.\n2.  Guilt tripping you for working, seeing family or friends without him, or focusing all energy on him are red flags.\n3.  The relationship may be consistently focused on being silly and lighthearted, creating issues when there's conflict.\n\n**How to Cultivate Golden Retriever Boyfriend Qualities**\n\n1.  Practice active listening by hearing what your partner is saying rather than just responding.\n2.  Look into each other's love languages and provide love in the preferred language.\n3.  Consider reaching out to a therapist if you're stuck in comparison cycles.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe Golden Retriever Boyfriend archetype can be both beneficial and problematic, highlighting the importance of balance and realistic expectations in relationships. While cultivating its qualities through active listening and love languages can strengthen connections, being aware of potential red flags is essential for maintaining healthy relationships. By understanding the nuances of this idealized relationship archetype, individuals can navigate their own relationships more effectively.

    "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/smut-books-ruin-dating-8685580",
    "content": "1- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6311358/ 2- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3941436/ 3- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4591299/ 4- https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-015-0590-y This article is for informational purposes only, even when quoting experts and peer-reviewed studies. It's not a substitute for professional advice or treatment. If you have concerns about your relationship or sex life, please consult with a mental health professional.  *This post was medically reviewed by Ivy Kwong, LMFT.* Read the full disclaimer here. **When Reading Smut Bleeds into Real Life**\n\nPerhaps, I've been single for too long (I have), but I often fantasize about book characters and wonder: why can't I have that in real life? These book boyfriends are *literally* killing their enemies to protect their women and meanwhile, I can't get a text back. And I'm not the only one who feels this way. So many BookTokers have made videos comparing the disappointment that is real-life men to fictional characters. And yes, I understand these characters are fictional but what they're doing-being intentional and communicative, showing love and care-is what I want from my partner. Are my expectations too high or am I being delusional and ignoring how IRL dating works?\n\n**What Does Reading Smut Say About Relationships, Dating, and Sex?**\n\nThere's nothing wrong with reading erotica or smut. If anything, it's a form of escapism, says Dr. Hertlein. The growing popularity of romance and erotic novels suggests that more people are enjoying the escapism that comes with getting into these kinds of stories. More people are also eager to learn about their sexual desires, says Dr. Janet Brito, a sex therapist and founder of The Sexual Health School. She credits the popularization of smut to individuals seeking inspiration to improve their own sex lives and the rising interest in different relationship types like polyamory. Even single people like myself who avidly read smut can find value.\n\nResearch shows that consuming sexually explicit content helps people feel more sexually confident with themselves and their bodies.1 I wasn't taught to feel okay with sex and sexual desires, but erotica and smut have become safe spaces for me to explore arousal and excitement with less shame and guilt.\n\n**How to Have a Healthy Sex Life While Reading Smut (Because, Yes, It's Possible)**\n\nSometimes, we readers get swept up in the fantasies. Eyes so glued to the paperback novel that IRL intimacy and sex have become non-existent. While a smut addiction does not exist, according to Dr. Brito, there is such a thing as too much smut, especially if it's beginning to impact your relationships.\n\nIt may become unhealthy if you're neglecting other responsibilities or avoiding engagement in real-life relationships, she says. In other words, if you're forgoing intimacy with your partner because they don't perform like the book boyfriends or are abandoning quality time with your S.O. because you're too focused on the novel, you might need to cut back on the smut.\n\nYou don't have to quit entirely but establishing boundaries could help. To maintain a healthy relationship with erotica without damaging your sexual and romantic relationships, set limits on reading time to ensure it doesn't interfere with quality time with your partner, Dr. Hertlein says. Prioritize real-life intimacy by consciously focusing on physical and emotional connections with your partner over fictional experiences.\n\nAlways reflect on your desire to read erotica, Dr. Hertlein adds. If you're reading smut because you like it, great! But if you find yourself obsessed with the sex or romance in the novel because it's lacking in your own life and preventing you from real-life intimacy, maybe it's time to put the smut reading on pause for reflection and in-person connection.\n\n**So, Does Smut Ruin Dating?**\n\nThe short answer? No. The long answer? Too much smut may create intimacy, dating, and relationship issues. But that's where discernment comes in. Accept that romance and smut books are primarily designed for entertainment, Dr. Brito advises. They often feature characters with ideal qualities and nearly perfect relationships.\n\nWhile they may include elements of real-life scenarios, their main purpose is to entertain you. Certain things like weird and awkward sex or miscommunication just aren't entertaining, so most romance and erotica won't include them. But that doesn't mean they don't happen in real life.\n\nNot every sexual moment between you and your partner (or even yourself) will be as magical as the novels claim. And dating sometimes sucks! Your perfect partner may not be a billionaire mafioso who kills any man who looks at you. It's very unlikely you'll randomly stumble upon the heir to a multi-million-dollar corporation and fake marry him to save your family from their rising debt.\n\nFrankly, you'll likely kiss lots of toads before you meet a prince. Because, unfortunately, that's the real world. And we live there, not in the sentences and fragments of an author.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\nIt's so easy to get swept into the romanticism of it all, but becoming disconnected from reality and lost in fantasy only leads to disappointment and maybe sadness, resentment, and despair. Dating is already hard and I don't need to make it any harder by being delusional. Finding a book boyfriend (does a thing even exist?) is not as easy as these female protagonists proclaim.\n\nAnd even if I find one, there's no certainty that we'll be compatible, have a happily ever after, or even have a good sex life. Hell, we may break up after two to three years. The story may be set in stone but reality isn't. Keep that in mind the next time you're scrolling on Hinge and believe you found the *one.* Chances are, they're nothing more than another number.

A study found a link between age and confidence, suggesting self-assurance is why younger partners seek out older partners. This same study also reported older partners are more accepting of younger counterparts.1 It goes without saying that many couples with an age gap find each other specifically because of their shared life goals and trajectories, despite their age difference, which is why they work, says clinical psychologist and holistic therapist Kim Slipski, MA, LMFT.\n\n**Do Age Gap Relationships Work?**\n\n*   Anna's Story: In my experience, what works well in an age gap relationship is the balance between our different energies and approaches to life. A big part of their component is learning from each other, which she finds fulfilling.\n*   Carter's Story: We just happened to fall in love with each other, like any other relationship.\n\n**Challenges**\nA study on Korean couples found an age gap of over three years resulted in an elevated risk for depressive symptoms, with the odds increasing with every one-to-two years of age difference.2 This isn't to say age gap relationships are doomed, but they do come with their own unique set of challenges.\n\n**Stigmas**\nIf you're facing judgment for your relationship, it is important to begin with some honesty and self-reflection.

My Roommate Is Ruining My Life**\n\nA bad roommate can make home sweet home anything but. Here's how to deal.\n\nBy Noma Nazish, Published on July 29, 2024\nVerywell Mind\n\nGetty Images\n\n**Table of Contents**\n===============\n\n*   [Understanding the Situation](#understanding-the-situation)\n*   [Weighing Your Options](#weighing-your-options)\n*   [Communication Strategies](#communication-strategies)\n*   [Conflict Resolution](#conflict-resolution)\n*   [Seeking Mediation or External Help](#seeking-mediation-or-external-help)\n*   [Self-Care and Coping Strategies](#self-care-and-coping-strategies)\n*   [Knowing When to Seek Alternative Living Arrangements](#knowing-when-to-seek-alternative-living-arrangements)\n\n**Understanding the Situation**\n=============================\n\nDealing with a bad roommate can be stressful. But with the right communication and conflict resolution techniques, it's possible to work things out and establish a harmonious relationship.\n\n### Types of Bad Roommates\n\n*   The Noisemaker: Your roommate is always too loud or throws late-night parties without notice.\n*   The Slob: They never clean up after themselves and treat the whole place like their personal dumpster.\n*   The Borrower: They take your things without asking and don't return them.\n*   The Passive-Aggressive: They show bitterness and hostility when they feel hurt or offended but never tell you what's bothering them.\n*   The Drama King or Queen: They are constantly surrounded by drama, seeking validation or sympathy.\n\n**Weighing Your Options**\n=====================\n\nSo, how can you address the issues you're having with your roommate in a constructive way? It could include strategies like improving communication, practicing assertiveness, and setting boundaries.\n\n### Strategies to Deal With Dysregulation\n\n*   Improve Communication: Have open conversations and practice assertiveness instead of passive aggression.\n*   Set Boundaries: Create ground rules after mutual discussion.\n*   Self-Care: Prioritize self-care to manage stress and improve emotional regulation.\n\n**Communication Strategies**\n==========================\n\nCommunication is not the same as confrontation. Keep in mind that communication should be an attempt to share feelings openly without worrying about being attacked for what you are feeling or needing.\n\n### Six Key Communication Strategies\n\n*   Use I Statements: Frame your concerns using 'I' statements to avoid sounding accusatory.\n*   Practice Non-Violent Communication (NVC): Remove blame and use empathy and neutral language.\n*   Keep Your Body Language Non-Aggressive: Make sure your body language is open and non-threatening while maintaining eye contact.\n*   Explain Rather Than Complain: Clearly define what the problem is and how it affects you and the shared living space.\n*   Assume Positive Intent: Sometimes, when other people don't behave favorably, they might simply be unaware or doing their best but still making mistakes.\n\n**Conflict Resolution**\n=====================\n\nWhen you live with others, conflicts are bound to happen over one thing or another. However, with a well-defined approach to conflict resolution, you don't have to avoid or overreact to these situations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Strategy for Conflict Resolution\n\n1.  Evaluate the Problem: Identify the issue and consider how it impacts you so you can communicate it to your roommate.\n2.  See If It's Actually a Dispute: Determine if the issue is worth discussing.\n3.  Pick the Right Time: Set a time and place to discuss the issue when both of you are calm and better able to communicate.\n4.  Listen Actively: Give your roommate a chance to share their perspective and listen to them without interrupting.\n5.  Seek Common Ground: Identify common objectives and work towards a solution.\n\n**Seeking Mediation or External Help**\n=====================================\n\nInvolving a neutral third party, such as a counselor or a resident advisor, can help roommates resolve their differences by providing an unbiased perspective and a structured framework for facilitating a constructive dialogue.\n\n### Benefits of Seeking Mediation\n\n*   A third-party mediator would be able to ensure the conversation stays on track and doesn't spiral into personal attacks.\n*   They are less likely to have tunnel vision when trying to resolve the situation and can come up with out-of-the-box solutions.\n\n**Self-Care and Coping Strategies**\n====================================\n\nWhen there is conflict at home, you experience physiological and psychological symptoms of fight-or-flight and anticipatory anxiety. It's essential to prioritize self-care to manage stress and improve emotional regulation.\n\n### Five Expert-Backed Self-Care Strategies\n\n*   Practice Mindfulness: Practicing mindfulness and relaxation techniques like breathwork, yoga, or gratitude journaling can significantly reduce stress and anxiety.\n*   Create a Personal Retreat: Establish a personal space where you can retreat to break away from daily stressors and unwind.\n*   Get Moving: Regular physical activity helps lower cortisol levels and releases endorphins, which are natural stress relievers.\n*   Don't Take It Personally: Know that whatever is happening is not personal. You could have 10 roommates and say the same thing to each one of them, and they will all react differently.\n*   Put Your Creative Hat On: Engaging in creative hobbies like painting, writing, or knitting can help take your mind off roommate troubles.\n\n**Knowing When to Seek Alternative Living Arrangements**\n=====================================================\n\nSometimes our fundamental needs and values conflict with those of our roommates. In this case, there may be no way around it but to transition to a new living situation.\n\n### Signs It's Time to Move On\n\n*   You have more L's (leave) than S's (stay) in your notepad.\n*   Your roommate is consistently causing stress and anxiety.\n*   You've tried addressing the issues, but they persist.",
