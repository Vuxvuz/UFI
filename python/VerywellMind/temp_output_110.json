Table of Contents Professional Considerations Positives of Changing Your Name Mistakes to Avoid Making the Decision Leading up to my wedding in 2005, I worked as an editor but aspired to be a writer. I told my brother that I needed to get published as Cathy Cassata before the wedding so I could keep my maiden name Cassata. He was quick to respond: Why do you need a published story to determine that? Just don't change it, if that's what you want. My husband shared the same sentiment and didn't bat an eye when I told him I wanted to keep my maiden name. In addition to anticipating how a name change would affect my career, I also didn't want to lose connection to a name and Italian culture I identified with since birth. Now that I have two children with their own last name, perhaps they feel the same allegiance to it. Today, my portfolio is packed with stories all with the same byline and I am still happy with my choice to keep my maiden name. Though, not every woman who gets married feels the same allegiance to her maiden name. In fact, 79% of women in opposite-sex marriages took their spouse's last name when they got married, according to 2023 Pew Research. Of women married to men, white women are more likely than Black and Hispanic women to take their spouses last name after marriage.1 Nora Gruenberg decided to take her ex-husband's last name because it was more important to him than keeping her maiden name was to her. I jumped into it with the attitude that I'm the same Nora but with an added layer. It was a rebrand! I know who I am, she says. In her divorce, she was given the right to reclaim her maiden name but she chose not to. It would seem that my philosophy that a 'Nora by any other name is just as Nora' still stands, she says. For women of all sexual orientations who have never been married, their views vary on the matter with 33% noting they would take their spouse's last name, 23% saying they would keep their maiden name, 17% saying they would hyphenate both names, and 24% indicating that they are not sure.1 Women taking their husband's last name began in the 9th century as a way to legally bind their identity to their husband and remove it from their father. Over time, taking on a spouse's name has become a tradition and symbolism of unity rather than an action that holds legal power. If you're about to get married or have recently married, you've probably given a lot of thought to the topic. So, should you change your name? Are there downsides to doing so? It's a personal choice that may vary from person to person, so let's take a look at why you may or may not want to change your name. Professional Considerations of Changing Your Name For some women, changing their last name after marriage may have no effect on their career. For others, Kathy Caprino, career coach, says it can alter how they are recognized within their professional networks, potentially impacting the reputation and personal brand they have built. For instance, if you have established a company or service with your maiden name and then change it, customers may become confused or it may be more confusing to share testimonials. Additionally, it can influence how we feel regarding our own personal identity and how we perceive ourselves internally and externally in our professional and personal circles, says Caprino. She suggests informing colleagues, clients, and professional contacts about your name change through a personal note or email. Administrative challenges, such as updating records and ensuring consistency across professional documents is another factor. A name change requires updating the following: Social Security card Driver's license Passport Bank accounts Professional licenses Employment records related to payroll, insurance, and retirement Personal records related to utility accounts, subscriptions, voter registration, etc. Each agency or organization may have its own process, timeline, and fees, so staying organized is crucial. For professionals with certifications or licenses, there can be additional requirements to ensure their updated name is recognized in their field, says Joe Nazarian, founder and managing partner at Pathway Law Firm. The administrative work was the biggest burden for Gruenberg. For women entertaining the thought of taking another name, really think about what it will take, she says. Now that I'm divorced, let me tell you, I'm not going through all of that again. Positives of Changing Your Name After Marriage Changing one's name after marriage might offer a fresh start or a new sense of privacy, especially if they wish to distance themselves from past professional associations or from families and individuals who weren't supportive or safe, says Cap",

    "content": "with Us\n\n**Here's How to Connect With a Kid, According to Psychologists**\n\n**Including some qs to ask them**\n\nBy Cathy Cassata Published on October 24, 2024 Verywell Mind Getty Images\n\n**Bridging the Gap**\n\nAsk Open-ended Questions\n\nAvoid Noisy Questions\n\nTips Topics to Avoid\n\nIt's not just me-talking to kids can be a struggle, right? Sometimes, it's like you have ~nothing~ in common. Other times, you forget they think and operate differently-their brains aren't fully developed-which makes connecting that more difficult.\n\nChildren are very much more in the moment than adults are, says Tammy Schamuhn, psychologist and cofounder of the Institute of Child Psychology. They don't focus as much on hindsight (the past) or foresight (what will happen in the future) as that is an executive functioning skill that is executed by the prefrontal cortex. (Btw, the brain finishes developing and maturing in the mid-to-late 20s with the prefrontal cortex maturing last).1 Moreover, children also have a more developed right hemisphere, where your emotions, movement, play, and creativity live, Schamuhn says.\n\nKids connect with their parents through mutual activities [like] riding bikes together, play, cuddling, and storytelling. All of this makes chatting with a seven-year-old a bit difficult. But there are ways to make connecting between us adults and kids super easy. Here's how.\n\n**How to Bridge the Gap Between an Adult Mind and Kid's Mind**\n\nKids' needs vary and change over time, which makes it tough for parents to know how to connect. Parent-child relationships are multidimensional, so sometimes children want you close. Other times, they want their independence, says Deborah Serani, PsyD, a psychologist and professor at Adelphi University.\n\nThis goes for little ones, teens, and even older adult children. A great way to slowly bridge this communication gap is by practicing empathy. A powerful way to foster empathy is to reflect on what it was like to be their age-what they felt, what they thought about, and how they behaved, Gretchen Moran Marsh, PhD, licensed clinical psychologist, says.\n\nShe adds that when adults put themselves in a kid's shoes, they are often surprised by the differences in their childhood perspective and adult thinking. Once adults reconnect with their younger selves, they tend to gain a greater sense of empathy and understanding for what children are going through.\n\n**A 4-Step Approach to Connecting**\n\nSerani recommends practicing the following steps to improve your connection with kids:\n\n1. Break the ice: Start off with something like, Oh, you're playing with your Legos\n2. Deepen the interest: Try asking Want some help? or Want someone to play with? and wait for their response. Depending on their needs, join in, or move on to another room.\n3. Make a deeper connection: If you're invited to join, ask open-ended questions like What do you want me to do? or What are we making?\n4. Continue to get deeper: Take the convo a step further by asking, How was school today? or What was T-ball like yesterday?\n\nThe goal is to meet a child at their comfort level, so they see your presence, interest, and connection is about wanting to be with them, Serani says.\n\n**Other Ways to Connect**\n\nStructured activities are great ways to connect with children. Serani suggests the following:\n\n*   Games like Do You Really Know Your Family, Beat the Parents, and Ungame.\n*   Books or journals such as The Us Journal and Just Between Us.\n*   Movement-based activities like playing tag or riding bikes.\n*   Outings or hobbies like going to the movies together or cooking together.\n\n**Ask Open-ended Questions**\n\nRather than asking kids close-ended questions like, How was your day or Did you have a good time at the party? which often instigates one-word responses like fine or ok, ask open-ended questions that tease the imagination or emotional centers of the brain, says Schamuhn. She suggests the following:\n\n*   If you could have a superpower, what would it be?\n*   What was the best worst part of your day?\n*   Tell me about a moment you were brave kind today?\n*   What are you grateful for?\n*   Tell me about someone you helped today?\n*   What's something you're looking forward to?\n*   What is something that makes you feel scared or worried?\n*   If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you go?\n*   If you could change the world in one way, what would you change?\n*   What do you wish we did differently as a family?\n*   What do you wish I did differently as a parent?\n\n**Get to Know Someone Better Through These 50 Questions**\n\nOpen-ended Questions Help Develop Kids' Well-being\n\nSerani says parents asking simple and concise open-ended questions about their kids' unique experiences can help form a positive connection and increase their well-being. This particular kind of well-being is called flourishing, where children develop optimism, a sense of belonging, greater self-confidence, autonomy, positive self-esteem, and many other traits.\n\nStudies looking at parent-child interactions around the globe revealed that the greater the family connection, the higher the rate of flourishing.3 Children with parents who love and have genuine interest in their singular specialness develop character strengths that help them move through adversity better in life, and find meaning and purpose in life, Serani adds.\n\n**Share Your Own Perspective (But Not *Too* Much)**\n\nWhen trying to connect with kids and teens, sharing your own experiences can be helpful but timing is everything, says Moran Marsh. I always recommend staying focused on the child's interests first. Make sure you truly understand their perspective before offering your own stories, she adds.\n\nTry This To gauge their interest in your perspective while respecting their autonomy and keeping the conversation balanced, consider asking questions like:\n\n*   Do you want to hear about a time when I went through something similar?\n*   I know what that's like. That happened to me too.\n*   Want to hear about it?\n\nIf they want to know more specifics, share minimal disclosure. If they want more, they will let you know by asking for more information.\n\nWhen we overshare and kids aren't ready for our stories, they feel like they are being lectured to or are overwhelmed by the information they're not ready to process, Serani says. So the trick to talking to kids is to let them lead the social dance steps. Once children feel heard and validated, they may naturally invite your perspective, asking questions like:\n\n*   What would you do in this situation?\n*   If they aren't ready for advice, respect that boundary, says Moran Marsh.\n\nRemember, children want to feel important, and moving too quickly into problem-solving can invalidate their thoughts, leading to emotional escalation.\n\n**Avoid Questions That Seem Nosy**\n\nChildren are highly perceptive and can quickly see through an adult's agenda, says Moran Marsh. Ask questions from a place of genuine curiosity rather than trying to steer the conversation. Take your time, and remember that your goal is to empathize and understand what the child is experiencing, she says.\n\nRapid-fire questions, especially if they come",

    "content": "Related Stories What You Need to Know About Narcissistic Personality Disorder Understanding Narcissism: A Guide For Non-Narcissists How To Identify and Deal With Emotional Manipulation 6 Things People With Narcissistic Personality Disorder Want You to Know\n\n**What Is Narcissism?**\n\nNarcissism, or narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), is a diagnosable personality disorder characterized by behavioral patterns like grandiosity, lack of empathy, and the chronic need for admiration.\n\n*   A true narcissist will display at least five of the following traits:\n    *   Heightened and grandiose sense of self-importance\n    *   Preoccupied with fantasies about power, brilliance, success, beauty, and or perfect love\n    *   Belief that they are special and should only associate with other special people or that they are only truly understood by other special people\n    *   Requiring excessive or effusive admiration\n    *   A sense of entitlement that would require unconditional favorable treatment and compliance with any and all demands\n    *   Exploiting others for their own gain\n    *   Lacking empathy and unable to recognize the feelings of others\n    *   Frequently envious of others and or thinks others are envious of them\n    *   Arrogant and haughty attitudes and behaviors\n\n**How Is Narcissism Different Than Being a Stuck-Up Jerk?**\n\n*   A true narcissist does not have the choice between behaving badly and behaving well; a choice between selfishness and generosity, or between nastiness and respect.\n*   Someone who is just being a jerk might recognize that their behavior only benefits them, and choose to go ahead with it anyway, because they place their own wellbeing above the wellbeing of others.\n\n**How to Deal With Narcissists...and Jerks**\n\n*   When dealing with a narcissist, it's imperative to remember that their behavior has absolutely nothing to do with you. No matter what you do or say, they will still behave narcissistically.\n*   If, on the other hand, the person you're dealing with is not actually a narcissist but is still behaving badly, you might want to (and be able to) explore what has triggered them to act the way they are acting.\n\n**Treatment for Narcissistic Personality Disorder**\n\n*   The best treatment for NPD is psychotherapy, or talk therapy.\n*   If someone with NPD pursues therapy and commits to changing the way they think about themselves and interact with the world, therapy can be successful. 1.1. Understanding and managing their emotions and tendencies, like their competitiveness and their inherent dislike of others and themselves\n    1.2. Relating more effectively with those around them to make their working and personal relationships better\n    1.3. Recognizing what they are actually good at in order to better tolerate criticism and failure\n    1.4. Setting realistic goals\n    1.5. Understanding and handling issues about self-esteem\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\n*   While narcissistic personality disorder is one of the more common personality disorders, the term narcissism is often used without a full understanding of the actual condition itself.\n*   Recognizing the difference between a true narcissist and someone who is just behaving unpleasantly can help people learn to more effectively deal with someone who does actually have NPD. 1.

How can I tell if someone is trying to manipulate me under the guise of setting a boundary?\n3. What are some signs that manipulation is occurring in a relationship?\n4. How do I communicate effectively with others when setting boundaries or addressing potential manipulation?\n5. What are some consequences of being manipulated in a relationship, and how can I protect myself? \n- \n**What Boundaries Look Like**\n\nSetting boundaries involves clearly communicating your needs and expectations to others while maintaining respect for their feelings and perspectives.\n\n1.  You have repeatedly asked your partner to help you with chores around the house, and they have consistently ignored you.\n2.  A person has requested that you change your behavior or meet a specific need of theirs in a respectful manner.\n3.  Someone is asking for something reasonable and achievable from you.\n4.  There's an open conversation about the problem and how to solve it together.\n\n**What Manipulation Looks Like**\n\nManipulation involves using guilt, threats, or other tactics to get what you want without considering the feelings or needs of others.\n\n1.  A person is making unreasonable demands of you, threatening consequences if their expectations aren't met.\n2.  Someone is not respecting your boundaries and is pushing you to do something that makes you uncomfortable.\n3.  There's no discussion about how to improve a situation together; instead, there's a focus on getting what one wants at the expense of others.\n4.  The person imposing the boundary is more focused on their own needs than on finding a solution that benefits both parties.\n\n**How to Tell the Difference**\n\nWhen setting boundaries, you're asking someone to respect your needs in a respectful manner. When manipulating, you're only focusing on what you want without considering anyone else's feelings or needs.\n\n1.  Consider what was asked of you.\n2.  Determine if it's something you can change and if it's reasonable.\n3.  Think about how the request was made: was it respectful or did it involve threats or guilt?\n4.  Reflect on who benefits from the situation and whether it's a win-win or a lose-lose.\n\n**How to Respond**\n\nIf someone is trying to manipulate you, try to engage them in conversation about the problem.\n\n1.  Ask them to explain what they need specifically.\n2.  Determine if their request is reasonable and achievable.\n3.  Discuss how to solve the problem together.\n4.  Set clear expectations for future interactions.\n\n**How to Change Your Behavior**\n\nIf you suspect that you've been manipulating someone, ask yourself these questions:\n\n1.  Am I trying to improve the situation or just get out of it?\n2.  Is what I'm asking for impossible or unreasonable?\n3.  Am I feeling like I want to punish this person?\n4.  Am I considering how my ultimatum will affect this person?\n\nBy recognizing the difference between boundaries and manipulation, you can build stronger relationships based on mutual respect and understanding.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n*   Setting boundaries is healthy; manipulation is toxic.\n*   Recognizing the signs of manipulation can help prevent destructive relationships.\n*   Effective communication is key to setting healthy boundaries and preventing manipulation. \n- The One Way You Might Be Manipulating Your Loved Ones Without Realizing It\n\n**What Boundaries Look Like**\n\nSetting boundaries involves clearly communicating your needs and expectations to others while maintaining respect for their feelings and perspectives.\n\n1.

This is chunk 1/1 of an article titled 'The One Way You Might Be Manipulating Your Loved Ones Without Realizing It'.\n\nWhat Boundaries Look Like\n\nHere's an example. Let's say that lately, every time you talk to your mother, she brings up the fact that you and your long-time partner are not married. You have repeatedly told her that marriage is not in the cards right now and that whenever she brings this up, you feel as though she is not listening to you or respecting your choices.\n\nIt has gotten to the point",

    "content": "**Title**\nMy Friend Betrayed Me-Should I Repair Our Friendship or Cut My Losses?\n\n**Overview**\nSome wounds can't be healed\n\nBy Wendy Rose Gould Updated on September 24, 2024 Reviewed by Ivy Kwong, LMFT Frank Rothe Getty Images\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n*   Does It Always Make Sense to Rebuild?\n*   When To Consider Repairing Your Friendship\n*   When Walking Away May Make Sense\n*   How To Rebuild Friendship After Betrayal\n\n**Does It Always Make Sense to Rebuild?**\n\nWhen deciding whether to mend or move on from a friendship, consider the nature and frequency of the betrayal, Dr. Ramsey says.\n\nIf it's a one-time event with a sincere apology and a change plan, rebuilding might be worth exploring.\n\nHowever, if betrayals seem to happen way too frequently-or they haven't been able to show any sense of remorse or willingness to change-then investing your energy elsewhere may be healthier.\n\n**When To Consider Repairing Your Friendship**\n\nIt was a one-off mistake or misunderstanding\n\n*   The mistake hasn't completely upended your life or caused irreparable harm\n*   The mistake didn't put you or others in grave danger\n*   They sincerely apologize and show genuine remorse\n*   Your friend understands how their actions hurt you and did not intend to hurt you\n*   They are committed to being better and to learning and doing things differently moving forward\n*   You have a deep, positive history together that's otherwise damage-free\n\n**When Walking Away May Make Sense**\n\nBetrayals happen frequently\n\n*   They aren't remorseful or understanding of the pain they've caused you\n*   It feels like they don't value your friendship in general\n*   Effort to mend or grow together is one-sided (they don't put the same energy in)\n*   You've seen them often treat others poorly, too\n*   You've reflected on your friendship together and realize your values no longer align\n\n**How To Rebuild Friendship After Betrayal**\n\nThe feelings you experience after a friend betrays you can be downright painful.\n\nYou may feel an overwhelming flurry of anger, sadness, frustration, shock, and loneliness-after all, they were the one you turned to so many times for everything else.\n\nBetrayal typically comes from someone you've allowed into your inner circle, someone who plays a significant role in your emotional foundation, says Patricia S. Dixon, Psy.D, a licensed clinical psychologist.\n\nThis turmoil is a natural response to the loss of trust and connection, and it can take time to process and heal from these feelings.\n\nGive yourself time to process what happened, and then-if it feels right-take these steps to rebuild your friendship again.\n\n1.  Validate Your Pain\n    Acknowledge your pain and hurt.\n    Feeling grief is a healthy and normal response, and it is important to honor these feelings and not minimize or avoid them.\n\n2.  Have an Open, Honest Conversation\n    Step number two is to talk it out-ideally in person.\n    A phone call may work, but try to avoid texting back and forth for this one.\n    Having a conversation about how the person hurt you, why you feel betrayed, and allowing them to apologize and acknowledge the pain they've caused is a great first step in rebuilding the friendship, says Goldberg.\n\n3.  Listen to Their Side\n    Give your friend a chance to explain their perspective.\n    This allows you to better understand where they are coming from, which can mend hurt feelings and soften anger.\n    This is also an opportunity to assess whether their apology feels genuine, and if you think that it's possible to move forward.\n\n4.  Remind Yourself Why You Were Friends\n    In the face of betrayal, you may question your own judgment with friendships.\n    As long as this is a one-off betrayal (versus an ongoing pattern), it may be helpful to remind yourself why you two were friends to begin with.\n    Goldberg says, \"Reminding yourself of the reasons you are grateful for the friendship can help put you back in the mindset of how much care there is between you two.\"\n\n5.  Genuinely Forgive Them\n    Grudges and building resentment won't help either of you.\n    Dr. Dixon says, \"Decide to forgive, while also clearly communicating your expectations for the friendship moving forward.\"\n    This helps establish a foundation of trust and respect as you work to rebuild your connection.\n\n6.  Take Small Steps to Reconnect\n    You may be surprised at how good you feel once you've hashed things out with your friend.\n    Even then, it's smart to ease back into the friendship.\n    Dr. Ramsey suggests taking small steps to reconnect and reestablish shared activities and positive experiences, allowing the friendship to grow and heal over time.\n    It may take some time, and things may not feel exactly like they once were, but following these steps will help you rebuild your friendship and get back to a more familiar place.\n\n**The Truth About *Real* Friendships**\n\nHere's the thing about any type of relationship: they're going to have ups and downs and won't follow a linear path.\nUnderstanding that human nature is flawed means one person's mistakes don't necessarily reflect who they are or how they can continue to support you in the future, says licensed therapist Rachel Goldberg, LMFT, PMH-C.\n\nKeep that in mind as you forge your path.\nBottom line: If you feel strongly that the bond you shared is worth rekindling-and if both parties are willing to learn and grow from past experiences-it is worthwhile to explore re-connection.\nScience repeatedly shows that friendships keep us healthy and happy, so putting effort into mending things when it makes sense is worth it in the long run.3\n\n**6 Benefits of Friendship and Why It's So Important to Stay Close**\n\nRead More: LIVING WELL RELATIONSHIPS 2 Sources\n\nBy Wendy Rose Gould\nWendy Rose Gould is a lifestyle reporter with over a decade of experience covering health and wellness topics.\nSee Our Editorial Process\nMeet Our Review Board\nShare Feedback \n\nNote that the original text was not provided in Markdown format, so it could not be directly converted.

Block, MD\nUpdated on July 19, 2024\n\nBipolar disorder is a mental health condition defined by periods (or episodes) of extreme mood disturbances that affect mood, thoughts, and behavior.\n\n#### There are two main types of bipolar disorders\n\n*   Bipolar I disorder involves episodes of severe mania and often depression.\n*   Bipolar II disorder involves a less severe form of mania called hypomania.\n*   There is also a third type known as cyclothymic disorder.\n\nResearch suggests that around 4.4% of U.S. adults will have bipolar disorder at some point in their lives.\n\n#### Genetics are thought to play a significant role, although brain abnormalities and environmental factors also contribute as causes of bipolar disorder\n\nMood stabilizers are usually the first-line treatment, but electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be used to address severe symptoms.\n\n### LIVING WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER\n\n5 Movies That Portray What It's Like to Have Bipolar Disorder\nSpeaking to a Loved One With Bipolar Disorder\nWhat It Really Feels Like to Live With Bipolar Disorder\nCould Your Child Have Bipolar Disorder?\n\n### FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\n#### What causes bipolar disorder?\n\nThe exact causes of bipolar disorder are not entirely understood. Research has shown that genetics play a significant role.\n\nOther causes include changes in the brain as well as environmental factors including childhood trauma or stress caused by major life changes.\n\nUnderstanding the causes may help scientists develop ways to prevent or treat the condition.\n\n#### Is bipolar disorder genetic?\n\nResearch suggests there is a strong genetic component in bipolar disorder. Twin studies have found that when one identical twin has the condition, the likelihood that their twin sibling will also have it is around 40%.\n\nWhile there is a genetic vulnerability, inherited factors interact with environmental influences that can play a role in triggering the disorder's onset.\n\n#### How is bipolar disorder treated?\n\nBipolar disorder is typically treated with medications and sometimes electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), therapy, and psychoeducation.\n\nCommon medications include mood stabilizers or anticonvulsants, as well as second or third generation antipsychotics. Antidepressants are typically avoided if possible due to risks including mania and rapid cycling.\n\n### Is bipolar disorder considered a disability?\n\nYour condition may be considered a disability that is protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or qualifies you for disability payments.\n\nIf your disability substantially limits your work, you may be able to request reasonable accommodations from your employer. You may qualify for disability benefits if your condition makes it impossible for you to maintain employment.\n\n### How do you know if you're bipolar?\n\nOnly a doctor or qualified mental health professional can diagnose you with bipolar disorder.\n\nYou may want to see your doctor if you are experiencing symptoms of mania, depression, or both.\n\nSymptoms of mania can include talking excessively, racing thoughts, decreased sleep, and delusions. Symptoms of depression may include fatigue, prolonged sadness, and loss of interest in activities.\n\n### KEY TERMS\n\n*   Bipolar I Disorder\n*   Bipolar II Disorder\n*   Cyclothymic Disorder\n*   Mania\n*   Hypomania\n*   Depression\n*   Psychotherapy\n*   Major Depressive Disorder\n*   Psychiatric Assessment\n*   Mood Charting\n\n### EXPLORE BIPOLAR DISORDER\n\nOver One-Third of Psychiatric Patients Are Misdiagnosed—Here Are Our Stories\n\nThe 8 Best Online Psychiatry Services That Take Insurance, Tried and Tested\n\nUnderstanding Autism and Bipolar Disorder\n\nCan Bipolar Disorder Show Up in a Brain Scan?\n\nAre There Different Types of Bipolar Disorder?\n\nWhat's the Difference Between Bipolar I and Bipolar II Disorder?\n\nWhat Is a Labile Affect?\n\nHypomania vs. Mania: What's the Difference?\n\nWhat It's Like Living with a Mood Disorder, As a Mental Health Professional\n\nIs Bipolar Disorder Caused By a Chemical Imbalance?\n\nCan Bipolar Disorder Cause Brain Damage?\n\nWhat Is Therapy for Bipolar Disorder?\n\nCan Bipolar Disorder Be Cured?\n\nHow Do I Know If I Have Bipolar Disorder?\n\nUnderstanding the BPD Favorite Person Relationship\n\nAn Overview of Mental Health Statistics\n\nBipolar Depression Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment\n\nBipolar Disorder Symptoms in Men\n\nWhat Medications Are Used to Treat Bipolar Disorder?\n\nBipolar Disorder Symptoms in Women\n\nWhat to Know About Coming Out of a Manic Episode\n\nDifferentiating Subtypes of Bipolar Disorder\n\nTreating Bipolar Disorder\n\nLoving With Bipolar Disorder: A Letter to My Husband\n\nWhat Does the Term 'High-Functioning' Bipolar Disorder Mean?\n\nHelpful Online Bipolar Disorder Support Groups\n\nThe Impact of Bipolar Disorder on Sex\n\nTips for Dating Someone With Bipolar Disorder\n\nLiving With Bipolar Disorder\n\nDoes Bipolar Disorder Qualify You for Disability?\n\nWhat Not to Do if You or a Friend Has Bipolar Disorder\n\nRacing Thoughts and Bipolar Disorder\n\nHow Long Do Manic and Depressive Episodes Last?\n\nTechniques to Tame the Fight-or-Flight Response\n\nSpring Mania: What It Is and What to Do If It Happens\n\nUnderstanding Bipolar Disorder and Narcissistic Personality Disorder\n\nWhat Is a Thought Disorder?\n\nWhat Is Emotional Lability?\n\nWhat Are Somatic Delusions?\n\nTreatment for Psychosis\n\nWhat Is Thought Broadcasting?\n\nUnderstanding Euthymia in Bipolar Disorder\n\nVivid Dreams, Nightmares, and Night Terrors in Bipolar Disorder\n\nRapid-Cycling Bipolar Disorder Symptoms, Risks, and Treatment\n\nDelusions Occurring in Bipolar Disorder\n\nSymptoms and Causes of Tardive Dyskinesia\n\nIdeas and Delusions of Reference in Bipolar Disorder\n\nMood Congruence and Incongruence in Bipolar Disorder\n\nMixed Episode Criteria for Bipolar Disorder\n\nClang Association in Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia\n\nWhat Is Psychosis?\n\nUnderstanding Bruxism and How It Relates to Mental Health\n\nWhat Is Bipolar Psychosis?\n\nWhat Are Hallucinations?\n\nDifferences Between Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia\n\nWhat Is Apathy?\n\nHow Sleep and Bipolar Disorder Interact\n\nWhat Is Akathisia?\n\nFlight of Ideas in Bipolar Disorder\n\nUnderstanding Mania and Manic Episodes\n\nQuiz for Bipolar Hypomania Episodes\n\nWhat Is Hypomania?\n\nSymptoms of Mania in Bipolar Disorder\n\n### More In Conditions A-Z\n\n*   Neurodivergence\n*   Phobias\n*   Anxiety\n*   Kids' Mental Health\n*   Addiction\n*   ADHD\n*   Eating Disorders\n*   BPD\n*   Depression",
