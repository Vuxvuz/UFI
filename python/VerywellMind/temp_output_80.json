Abuse\n2.   Violence\n3.   Natural disasters\n4.   Accidents\n5.   Terrorism\n6.   Illness\n7.   The sudden death of a loved one\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\n*   Re-experiencing the traumatic event\n*   Avoidance of reminders of the trauma\n*   Startling easily\n*   Negative thoughts and beliefs\n\nThere are effective treatments that can help, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), exposure therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n1.   What causes PTSD?\n    *   There are a number of factors that can play a role in how people respond to traumatic events.\n    *   Genetics can influence how people handle stress during and after a trauma.\n    *   People may be more likely to develop PTSD if they also have an existing mental health condition, have experienced trauma in the past, face other life stressors, and lack social support.\n\n2.  How is PTSD treated?\n    *   There are a number of treatments that can help reduce or eliminate PTSD symptoms.\n    *   Antidepressants are sometimes prescribed to reduce symptoms of PTSD and manage symptoms of depression and anxiety if present.\n    *   Psychotherapy techniques such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), cognitive processing therapy, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) can also help.\n\n3.  How can you help someone with PTSD?\n    *   One way to help a loved one with PTSD is to learn about the symptoms and the challenges of living with the condition.\n    *   Encourage your loved one to seek help from a trained professional.\n    *   Unaddressed symptoms of PTSD can become more severe over time, so it is important to try and help them find resources to begin the healing process.\n\n**Key Terms**\n\n1.

Psychiatric Disorder: A psychiatric disorder is a mental illness that significantly affects thinking, behavior, and emotions.\n3.

It involves counting down from five to one and then taking immediate action on a task or activity.\n\n*   Counting down engages the prefrontal cortex, which assists with decision-making.\n*   The rule encourages you to take action right away, without overthinking.\n*   It helps create a sense of urgency and importance around completing a task.\n\n**How It Works**\nThe 5-second rule works by creating momentum and building confidence.

It is vital for building resilience toward life's stressors that we can't eliminate.\n\nWhen you've taken steps to care for your mind and body, you'll be better equipped to live your best life. Unfortunately, however, many of us view self-care as a luxury rather than a priority. Consequently, we're left feeling overwhelmed, tired, and ill-equipped to handle life's inevitable challenges.\n\n\n**Physical Self-Care**\n\nWe need to take care of our bodies if we want them to run efficiently. Remember that there's a strong connection between our body and our mind. When we care for our bodies, we'll think and feel better, too.\n\nPhysical self-care includes fueling your body, getting enough sleep, doing enough physical activity, and caring for your physical needs. Attending healthcare appointments, taking medication as prescribed, and managing your health are all part of good physical self-care.\n\n\n*   Are you getting adequate sleep?\n*   Is your diet fueling your body well?\n*   Are you taking charge of your health?\n*   Are you getting enough exercise?\n\n\n**Social Self-Care**\n\nSocialization is key to self-care. But, often, it's hard to make time for friends, and it can be easy to neglect our relationships when life gets busy.\n\nClose connections are important to your well-being. The best way to cultivate and maintain close relationships is to put time and energy into building our relationships with others.\n\n\n*   Are you getting enough face-to-face time with your friends?\n*   What are you doing to nurture your relationships with friends and family?\n\n\n**Mental Self-Care**\n\nThe way we think and the things that we're filling our minds with greatly influence our psychological well-being.\n\nMental self-care includes doing things that keep your mind sharp, like puzzles or learning about a subject that fascinates you. You might find reading books or watching inspiring movies fuel your mind.\n\n\n*   Are you making enough time for activities that mentally stimulate you?\n*   Are you doing proactive things to help you stay mentally healthy?\n\n\n**Spiritual Self-Care**\n\nResearch shows that a lifestyle including religion or spirituality is generally a healthier lifestyle.\n\nNurturing your spirit, however, doesn't have to involve religion. It can involve anything that helps you develop a deeper sense of meaning, understanding, or connection with the universe.\n\n\n*   What questions do you ask yourself about your life and experience?\n*   Are you engaging in spiritual practices that you find fulfilling?\n\n\n**Emotional Self-Care**\n\nIt's essential to have healthy coping skills to deal with uncomfortable emotions, like anger, anxiety, and sadness.\n\nEmotional self-care may include activities that help us acknowledge and express our feelings regularly and safely.\n\n\n*   Do you have healthy ways to process your emotions?\n*   Do you incorporate activities into your life that help you feel recharged?\n\n\n**Why Is Self-Care Important?**\n\nHaving an effective self-care routine has been shown to have a number of important health benefits. Some of these include:\n\n\n*   Reducing anxiety and depression\n*   Reducing stress and improving resilience\n*   Improving happiness\n*   Increasing energy\n*   Reducing burnout\n*   Stronger interpersonal relationships\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), self-care is essential because it can help promote health, prevent disease, and aid people in better coping with illness.\n\n\n**Develop Your Self-Care Plan**\n\nAn effective self-care plan should be tailored to your life and your needs. It needs to be something created by you, for you.\n\nCustomizing your own self-care plan can act as a preventative measure to make sure that you don't get overwhelmed, overstressed, and burned out.\n\n\n1. Assess your needs: Make a list of the different parts of your life and major activities that you engage in each day.\n2. Consider your stressors: Think about the aspects of these areas that cause stress and consider some ways you might address that stress.\n3. Devise self-care strategies: Think about some activities that you can do that will help you feel better in each of these areas of your life.\n4. Plan for challenges: When you discover that you're neglecting a certain aspect of your life, create a plan for change.\n5. Take small steps: You don't have to tackle everything all at once.\n6. Schedule time to focus on your needs: Even when you feel like you don't have time to squeeze in one more thing, make self-care a priority.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can develop an effective self-care plan that meets your unique needs and helps you maintain overall well-being.

It can also help you with the practical side of mental health management like journal prompts and meditation ideas. Although ChatGPT is not everyone's cup of tea, it can be used responsibly and is something to consider keeping in your mental health toolkit. If you are struggling with your mental health, though, you shouldn't rely on ChatGPT as the main way to cope. Everyone who is experiencing a mental health challenge can benefit from care from a licensed therapist. If that's you, please reach out to your primary care provider for a referral or reach out directly to a licensed therapist near you.  [1] Elembaby, M., PsyD (2023).

    "content": "**5 Things People Do in the First 10 Minutes of Their Day That Make a Big Difference**\n\nSome unexpected updates to the morning routine\n\n\nBy Julia Childs Heyl, MSW\n\nUpdated on May 28, 2025\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nYou Can Talk to Your Pets\nYou Can Embrace a Spiritual Interest\nYou Can Sit in Complete Silence\nYou Can Look Out the Window and Get Some Sun\nYou Can Take Some Time to Be Creative\n\n**How to Take Your Mornings to the Next Level**\n\nWe all know that how you start your day matters, and morning rituals have become a cornerstone of overall wellness. It isn't uncommon to hear everyone from your boss to celebrities herald their morning routines as a reason they're successful. Though drinking hot lemon water, exercising, and meditation are the typical morning go-tos, we became interested in hearing more about the uncommon routines people do in those precious first ten minutes of the morning.\n\nWe talked to five different people with widely varying occupations, ranging from a writer to massage therapist to professional skateboarder... Some of their morning rituals were unique twists on tried-and-true go-tos, while others were ones we had never considered. Read on to get some inspiration on how to revamp your mornings.\n\n**You Can Talk to Your Pets**\n\nJoey*, a writer we talked to, shared that their morning routine is simple: They drink coffee and talk to their cats.\n\nI think that because I spend a lot of my day on my computer looking at the screen for writing and stuff, it's lovely to start my day interacting with these sweet furry creatures, they explained. Watching them play while Joey drinks coffee isn't only a respite from the inevitable screentime Joey faces-they also named an element of humor they find particularly uplifting.\n\nThey make me laugh. Cats are very funny, so there's also something grounding about enjoying the humor of it all. This sweet morning ritual isn't just a cute moment they share with their pets. Laughter is actually proven to lower cortisol levels, too.1\n\n**You Can Embrace a Spiritual Interest**\n\nLily is a creative director and astrologer. When it comes to prepping for her day during the week, she relies on classic methods like drinking hot lemon water and going for a long walk with her dog. However, she digs into a different routine on the weekends.\n\nI usually like to start my leisurely days with a spiritual mental component, she shares. She'll light a candle, pull a tarot card, and journal. Then, her final step is to review the day's astrological aspects. It feels great to start my day like this because there is a depth to it that I really love, she continued.\n\nIt's important to note that Lily uses astrology as a supportive tool to understand how she might experience the day, but she doesn't use it as an end-all be-all oracle. The point is to use it as a tool for self-reflection and consideration of what's to come. Using astrology to try to predict the future or relying on astrological aspects as definitive information can increase stress. As with all things, moderation is key.2\n\n**You Can Sit in Complete Silence**\n\nLeeann is a massage therapist. This means her job isn't only physically demanding, it can be emotionally taxing too. That's why she observes a period of complete silence in the morning.\n\nShe's not meditating, reading, drinking coffee-she is just still. This practice was prompted by her partner's needs. Her partner, who is also a massage therapist, wakes up and cleans their entire home. It helps her start the day with a clean slate. She also prefers quiet while she cleans.\n\nThis led Leann to quietly be with herself in the mornings, and she realized it is the perfect dynamic for them and the perfect practice for her. Being in a client-based business, you're constantly chatting. I have to adjust myself to other people's tone and that can be exhausting, she shared.\n\nHer quiet mornings refill her cup so she seldom feels depleted at the end of the day.\n\n**You Can Look Out the Window and Get Some Sun**\n\nThis next one is for those who don't fancy themselves morning people. It is well known that getting some sun in the morning can increase melatonin production and make for much better sleep in the evening. Some people hold to this and make sure they get outside every single morning.\n\nBut there is another set of people who would love to go for a morning walk but can't seem to get out of bed early enough to do so. If you fall into that category, then this suggestion is for you. Mike, a retired professional skateboarder, isn't a morning person. He lives in a condo, so he doesn't have a backyard he can walk out into to get the sun in his eyes.\n\nInstead, he brushes his teeth, drinks a large glass of water, and stands in the sun by the brightest window. By staring into the light, he finds himself getting more energy. Sure, going outside and getting light with no interference from the window is probably ideal, but let's call this the next best thing.3 Also, we should clarify that the benefit of sunlight on your eyes does not mean looking directly at the sun, which can blind you.\n\n**You Can Take Some Time to Be Creative**\n\nKatie, a writer and producer, is doing all the right things in the morning: Meditation, water, and exercise. She also dedicates one to two hours of her mornings to writing. While some may focus on journaling and gratitude lists, Katie focuses on her creative projects, like a feature film she's penning.\n\nI feel like I get a little dopamine boost, explains Katie as she speaks about why she loves writing in the morning. It makes me much happier because I've carved out time for my creative work, she continued.\n\n**How to Take Your Mornings to the Next Level**\n\nEvery person we interviewed had this one thing in common: They all found a unique way to meet a key personal need. Joey noticed the screen fatigue setting in and opted for some early morning laughter, courtesy of their cats. Lily prefers an introspective and spiritual approach to her days, so she draws the astrology chart for the day.\n\nLeanna is still recharging from her clients from the day before, so silence, without the pressure of meditation, is key. Not a morning person? Mike found a solution. Katie made the stereotypical practice of writing in the morning all her own.\n\nTo level up your mornings, tap into what you feel the most depleted by at the end of the day. Maybe it is socializing, or not having time for a creative project, or not being able to sleep. Whatever it is, see how you can counteract that with one simple act you do first thing in the morning.\n\nUse that as the foundation for your new and improved morning routine.\n\n*All names have been changed*\n\nRead More: LIVING WELL SELF-IMPROVEMENT\n\n3 Sources\n\nBy Julia Childs Heyl, MSW\n\nJulia Childs Heyl, MSW, is a clinical social worker and writer.
