And if he didn't get a chance, he'd text them later to tell them he saw them at that specific place and time. He enjoys having lots of friends whereas I prefer a few close ones.\n\nAccording to TikTok, he's the golden retriever trope to my black cat persona.

It's a metaphor for understanding your personality traits and how they interact with those of your partner. The key to a successful relationship is communication, respect, and compromise.

However, if you're struggling, it may be helpful to see a therapist or counselor. They can help you understand how the family dynamics you grew up with are affecting your present life and teach you how to form healthier habits and relationships.  - **How Growing Up in a Big Family Shapes Your Development** - **Characteristics of Children in Big Families**\n\n*   Communication: Children in large families often develop excellent communication skills early on, as they frequently interact with family members of various ages.\n*   Sociability: Having many family members means that there are more people coming and going through the cycles of life. Children learn to navigate relationships with other members of the family and develop strong social skills as a result.\n*   Collaboration: Big families tend to require members to work together to achieve common goals, such as making dinner, planning birthday parties, or even sharing the bathroom so everyone can get to school work on time.\n*   Conflict resolution: Children have to learn to share, compromise, and negotiate with multiple siblings for resources, time, and space, which can help them develop strong conflict resolution skills.\n*   Self-reliance: With their parents' time and attention divided among multiple family members, kids often learn to be more self-reliant.\n*   Adaptability: Living in a dynamic environment with various personalities, preferences, and schedules tends to teach children to be flexible and adaptable.\n*   Responsibility: Children often have to help out with household chores from a young age, fostering a sense of duty and responsibility.\n*   Patience: Children often have to wait their turn, which can help them learn that immediate gratification isn't always possible.\n*   Resourcefulness: Children who grow up in big families learn to adapt to strained resources-both financial and emotional.\n*   Resilience: Children often develop thicker skin, becoming adept at managing stress and coping with setbacks.\n*   Playfulness: Big families often have a lively, playful atmosphere, fostering a good sense of humor and a love for fun.\n*   Support: Big families often experience deep, lifelong bonds and a strong sense of support and belonging.\n*   Competitiveness: Growing up with many siblings can instill a sense of competition among children. More family members can mean less direct access to parents but it can also mean learning to grow and work with other family members. Reduced parental guidance can teach children independence, patience, leadership, and collaboration.\n\n**Impact of Big Families on Personality Development**\n\nGrowing up in a big family can vary widely depending on factors such as the emotional capability of parents, the presence and involvement of grandparents or other relatives, the age gap between siblings, and the availability of help support.\n\n*   If children are able to form a secure identity that is bonded to the safety of a solid parental foundation, they may develop a strong sense of self.\n*   However, if children lack parental security while growing up and get lost in the numbers, it may shake the foundation of trust and bonding that is required to form a strong sense of self.\n\n**Practical Strategies for Raising Children in Big Families**\n\nRaising kids in a big family can be both rewarding and challenging.

    "content": "With Us Follow us on social media @VerywellMind\n\n**Title**\n24 Questions to Ask Yourself Before Rekindling With Your Ex\n\n**Overview**\nRekindling a relationship with an ex can be tempting, especially if the timing feels right or personal growth has occurred. However, it's essential to reflect on the primary issues that caused the breakup and whether they have been resolved.\n\n1. What primary issues caused the breakup, and have they been resolved?\n2. Am I romanticizing the past and overlooking glaring issues?\n3. Have I spent enough time nurturing myself and my own growth?\n\n**Signs It Might Make Sense to Get Back With Your Ex**\n\n*   Abuse was or is present (physical, emotional, verbal, financial)\n*   There's a substance abuse issue (active treatment and resolution should come first)\n*   Little to no changes have been made by one or both\n*   Important life goals and values remain fundamentally different and unaligned\n*   You're feeling lonely wistful versus seeing genuine potential in the partnership\n\n**Signs It Might Not Make Sense to Get Back With Your Ex**\n\n*   Timing was an issue and circumstances have changed\n*   Personal growth, reflection, and changes in behavior have occurred with both parties\n*   Both parties are equally working on the relationship with a shared interest, commitment, and effort\n*   You've aligned on short and long-term life goals\n*   Your communication patterns have improved\n\n**What to Ask Yourself Before Getting Back With An Ex**\n\n1. What do I consider the core components of a healthy relationship?\n2. Can I find this in my former partner?\n3. What do I admire most about who my ex is right now?\n4. How is this person showing up in our dynamic and in their life in general? Do I respect it?\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Ex Before Getting Together Again**\n\n1. Why do you want to be with me right now?\n2. Is our desire to get back together mutual, and are we both willing to put in an equal amount of effort?\n3. What does being with me bring out in you that is positive and that can be challenging?\n4. What have you learned from mistakes made and how can you better engage in a relationship with me? 5. How are we going to address the issues we faced in the past differently than we have before?\n6. Can we acknowledge that our first relationship is over, and are you willing to start a new one with me?\n\n**Conclusion**\nRekindling a relationship with an ex can be challenging, but it's essential to reflect on the primary issues that caused the breakup and whether they have been resolved. Asking yourself and your ex these questions will help you gain greater clarity and confidence in making this decision. Only you can both know what is truly best for yourself, so take as much time as you need to make this decision. Whether you decide to move forward together or continue your separate ways, honestly reflecting and communicating with intention will help you navigate the complexities of rekindling a relationship with an ex. 3 Sources\n\n1.

    "content": "References:1 . National Institute of Mental Health. (2020). Codependency in the Family of an Addicted Person. 2. National Library of Medicine. (n.d.). The role of empathy in codependent relationships.\n \n**How to Spot the Signs of Codependency**\n\nCodependency refers to an imbalanced relationship pattern where one person assumes responsibility for meeting another person's needs to the exclusion of acknowledging their own needs or feelings.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Biological: The prefrontal cortex part of a codependent person's brain may fail to suppress empathic responses, creating an overabundance of empathy.\n*   Psychological: People who are codependent may be psychologically predisposed to care for others and affected by negative life experiences, such as growing up with parents who fought a lot or being a victim of neglect or emotional abuse.\n*   Social: Codependency may result from changes in how society views women's roles or the increased exposure of substance abuse within family units.\n\n**Signs**\n\n1.  Having a sense of walking on eggshells to avoid conflict with the other person\n2.  Feeling the need to check in with the other person and ask permission to do daily tasks\n3.  Often being the one who apologizes-even if you have done nothing wrong\n4.  Feeling sorry for the other person, even when they hurt you\n5.  Regularly trying to change or rescue troubled, addicted, or under-functioning people whose problems go beyond one person's ability to fix\n6.  Doing anything for the other person, even if it makes you feel uncomfortable\n7.  Putting the other person on a pedestal, despite the fact that they don't merit this position\n8.  A need for other people to like you in order to feel good about yourself\n9.  Struggling to find any time for yourself, especially if your free time consistently goes to the other person\n10. Feeling as if you've lost a sense of yourself within the relationship\n\n**Why It's Unhealthy**\n\n*   Responsibility for relationships with others needs to coexist with responsibility to self.\n*   Codependency can lead to an unhealthy dynamic where one person loses their true sense of self since they're pouring so much into the other person.\n*   Codependency can be difficult to remove oneself from a relationship since one may feel the other person relies on them.\n\n**How to Overcome**\n\n1.  Focus on self-awareness\n2.  Seek therapy to help unravel codependent tendencies\n3.  Become the president of your own fan club by learning to speak lovingly and positively to yourself\n4.  Take small steps toward separation in the relationship\n5.  Seek activities outside of the relationship and invest in new friendships\n6.  Focus on figuring out what makes you who you are, then expand upon them\n7.  Actively turn your attention inward when tempted to think or worry about someone else\n8.  Stand up for yourself if someone criticizes, undermines, or tries to control you\n9.  Consider trying a support group or group psychotherapy\n\n**Takeaway**\n\nCodependency comes in many forms and levels of intensity and often leads to an unhealthy relationship dynamic that progressively gets worse over time as the codependent person loses a sense of themselves. Recognizing the signs of codependency is the first step, then self-awareness and active redirection are key in reducing your codependent tendencies. Be kind to yourself as you work through the process, undoing years of this learned behavior.  <hr/> \n\n**References**\n\n1\\. National Institute of Mental Health. (2020).

We're here to support you.\n\n**The Dos and Don'ts of Double Texting**\n\n**What Is Double Texting, Exactly?**\nDouble texting is when we send someone a second (or sometimes even a third, fourth, or fifth) text message before they've replied to our previous one.\n\n*   Examples of double texting:\n    *   Playful nudge: Just checking in!\n    *   Direct question: Did you get my last message?\n    *   Confirming plans: Hey, just making sure we're still on for later!\n    *   Adding to a previous thought: Oh, and I forgot to mention, tonight's restaurant also has a live band.\n    *   Time-sensitive follow-up: Hey, just wanted to make sure you saw my message about the concert tickets before they sell out!\n    *   Introducing a new conversation topic: I just had the worst Monday.\n    *   Excited overshare: Omg, I just saw something that reminded me of you!\n    *   Playing it cool: [Sending a double text disguised as a meme]\n    *   Passive-aggressive poke: Guess you're busy.\n    *   Argumentative mood: Why are you ignoring me?\n    *   Impatient annoyance: ???\n    *   Emotional response: I'm really upset that you haven't replied. What's going on?\n    *   Stream of multiple messages: Why aren't you responding to me? Do you hate me? Am I not good enough for you?\n\n**Why Do We Double Text?**\nWe double text for a lot of reasons. While some are totally valid, others are driven purely by anxiety.\n\nSome of the reasons for double texting might include:\n\n1.  Following up on something urgent\n2.  Checking if they saw our message\n3.  Clarifying something\n4.  Adding a forgotten detail\n5.  Feeling anxious\n6.  Sharing excitement\n7.  Wanting to keep the conversation going\n8.  Being insecure\n\n**When Is Double Texting Appropriate?**\nDouble texting is totally fine in certain situations-it's all about context, timing, and tone.\n\nHere are some cases where it's appropriate:\n\n1.  When you're apologizing\n2.  When it's time-sensitive\n3.  When you forgot to include important information\n4.  When the conversation naturally calls for it\n5.  When you have a close relationship with the person\n6.  When it's been a reasonable amount of time\n\n**When to Avoid Double Texting?**\nDouble texting isn't always a great idea-sometimes, it can come off as pushy or even a little needy.\n\nHere are some situations where you should probably hold off:\n\n1.  When you know they're busy\n2.  When it's only been a short while\n3.  When it's a new acquaintance\n4.  When they're not reciprocating interest\n5.  When you're feeling anxious\n6.  When it's an argument or a serious conversation\n7.  When they've already seen your message\n8.  When the conversation has ended\n9.  When you've already sent multiple unanswered texts\n10. When it's late at night\n\n**The Negative Consequences of Double Texting**\nDouble texting isn't always a bad thing, but it can backfire if it's overdone.\n\nHere are some potential negative consequences to keep in mind:\n\n1.  Looking desperate\n2.  Pushing people away\n3.  Appearing impatient\n4.  Coming across as passive-aggressive\n5.  Creating misunderstandings\n6.  Lowering your perceived value\n7.  Signaling imbalance\n\n**How to Double Text Considerately**\nDouble texting can be totally fine if it's done considerately.\n\nHere are some tips to help you double text without coming off as pushy, impatient, or needy:\n\n1.  Give it some time: Before sending a second message, pause and ask yourself whether you have given them enough time to respond.\n2.  Keep it casual and friendly: Your follow-up should feel light, not like you're pressuring them.\n3.  Make it quick: Get straight to the point.\n4.  Highlight any urgency: If there's an actual deadline, say so.\n5.  Read the room: Context matters.\n6.  Ask yourself how you would feel: Before you hit send, ask yourself, if the roles were reversed, would this message make you feel comfortable or pressured?\n7.  Know when to let it go: If you've already followed up once and still haven't gotten a response, it's best to leave it alone.\n\n**Alternatives to Double Texting**\nIf you're tempted to send a double text but don't want to come off as pushy, there are plenty of other ways to handle the situation.\n\nHere are some alternatives to consider:\n\n1.  Distract yourself: Sometimes, the best thing to do is... nothing.\n2.  Send a meme or an inside joke: If your first message wasn't urgent but you still want to nudge the conversation along, send something fun-like a meme, GIF, or a callback to a previous joke.\n3.  Start a new conversation: If your last message didn't get a response, maybe it wasn't the right topic.\n4.  Call if it's important: If it's actually urgent, a quick phone call can save you from the awkwardness of multiple unanswered texts.\n\n**Takeaways**\nDouble texting isn't inherently bad-it all comes down to how and why we do it.\n\nIf it's a casual follow-up, a playful message, or a necessary reminder, it can be totally fine. But when it crosses into pushy, impatient, or anxious territory, it might do more harm than good.\n\nThe key is to read the situation, give the person space, and choose your words wisely. If you're double texting out of excitement or practicality, go for it! But if it's driven by insecurity or a need for validation, it might be worth taking a step back.\n\nIf someone wants to reply to your original message, they will. And if they don't, you have your answer.  - Read more about the art of texting after a first date and what to say when. - Discover how textual compatibility can make or break a relationship. - Learn about the different types of attachment styles and their impact on relationships. - Get expert advice on how to navigate conflicts in relationships. - Find out why being clingy is not always a bad thing, but can be a sign of insecurity.",

    "content": ": The post **Sleep and Dreaming** appeared first on The Mighty. 4.2k shares\n\n**What is sleep and dreaming?**\n\nSleep is a basic bodily function that plays an essential role in our overall well-being, but getting quality rest can be challenging due to various reasons such as anxiety, physical illness, or consuming too much caffeine late at night.\n\n**What happens during sleep and dreaming?**\n\nDuring sleep, our brain goes through different stages, including REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM sleep. REM sleep is characterized by increased brain activity, muscle relaxation, and rapid eye movements, while non-REM sleep is marked by slower brain waves and less eye movement.\n\n**How much sleep do we need?**\n\nThe amount of sleep needed varies depending on age, with newborns needing 14 to 17 hours, infants requiring 12 to 16 hours, and adults needing at least 7 hours per night.\n\n**What are some common sleep disorders?**\n\nSome common sleep disorders include insomnia, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea. Insomnia is characterized by difficulty falling or staying asleep, while narcolepsy involves excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleep apnea occurs when a person stops breathing for short periods during the night due to upper airway obstruction.\n\n**What can we do to improve our sleep?**\n\nDeveloping better sleep habits, such as establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding screens before bed, can help improve sleep quality. Additionally, practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, can also promote better sleep.\n\n**How can we understand our dreams?**\n\nDreams can be influenced by our thoughts, emotions, and experiences, and understanding them can provide insight into our unconscious mind. Lucid dreaming, which is the ability to control and direct one's dreams, can also be a valuable tool for personal growth and self-awareness.\n\n**What are some common dream themes?**\n\nSome common dream themes include being chased, falling, or flying, as well as experiencing vivid sensations such as pain or pleasure. These themes can be influenced by our waking experiences and emotions, and understanding them can provide insight into our subconscious mind.\n\n**How can we improve our sleep and dreaming?**\n\nImproving sleep quality through better sleep habits and relaxation techniques can enhance our ability to dream and access the subconscious mind. Practicing self-awareness and mindfulness can also help us understand our dreams and gain insights into our thoughts, emotions, and experiences. 7 Foods to Help You Get a Great Night's Sleep When Dreams Merge With Your Waking Life-What to Know About Deja Reve The Drunken Monkey Sleep Hack Might Be a TikTok Trend Worth Trying What Does It Mean to Dream About Being Chased?

    "content": "**Toxicity and Abuse**\n\nWords like narcissism and toxicity are thrown so causally around nowadays. But how much do we actually know about toxicity and abuse? Not just what TikTok or Twitter has told us.\n\n**What Is Toxicity and Abuse?**\n\nNot all toxic relationships are abusive; however, all abusive relationships can be considered toxic. In a toxic relationship, there is usually a lack of respect and a violation of boundaries. Sometimes, this behavior occurs without the person even realizing they're doing it. But, if this kind of behavior is consistently repeated with the active intent to harm the other person, the relationship could be considered abusive.\n\n**Signs of Toxicity and Abuse**\n\nEvery relationship is different and may change over time. A relationship can start out very healthy and slowly turn into something you need to fix (or get out of). And there are some important qualities that tend to characterize unhealthy relationships. These qualities are control, disrespect, poor communication, and lack of trust.\n\n*   Control: When one person in the relationship tries to dominate or manipulate the other.\n*   Disrespect: When one person is consistently belittled, mocked, or disrespected by the other.\n*   Poor Communication: When both partners have difficulty communicating effectively, leading to misunderstandings and hurt feelings.\n*   Lack of Trust: When one or both partners don't feel secure in the relationship due to dishonesty, infidelity, or other issues.\n\n**Types of Abuse**\n\nDomestic abuse can take many forms. These are some of the different types of domestic abuse:\n\n1.  **Physical Abuse:** Physical harm or threats of physical harm.\n2.  **Sexual Abuse:** Forcing someone into unwanted sexual activity or touching.\n3.  **Neglect:** Failing to provide basic needs like food, shelter, or medical care.\n4.  **Emotional or Psychological Abuse:** Using fear, guilt, or manipulation to control the other person.\n5.  **Financial Abuse:** Controlling or restricting access to financial resources.\n6.  **Cultural Identity Abuse:** Targeting someone's cultural identity or background for abuse.\n7.  **Technological Abuse:** Using technology to monitor, track, or control the other person.\n8.  **Immigration Abuse:** Threatening or using immigration status as a form of control.\n\n**Key Terms**\n\n*   **Domestic Abuse:** A pattern of behavior used to hurt, terrorize, manipulate, or gain control over a family member.\n*   **Gaslighting:** A form of emotional abuse that causes someone to doubt their own sanity or reality.\n*   **Narcissism:** A diagnosable personality disorder characterized by grandiosity, lack of empathy, and the chronic need for admiration.\n*   **Reactive Abuse:** When someone who has been abused lashes out at their abuser in return.\n\n**Exploring Toxicity and Abuse**\n\nIf you're concerned about a toxic relationship or experiencing abuse yourself, seek help from a trusted friend, family member, or professional. Resources like support groups, hotlines, and therapy can provide the guidance and safety needed to navigate these complex issues.\n\nSome recommended resources include:\n\n*   National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233)\n*   National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) Helpline (1-800-950-6264)\n*   The National Dating Abuse Helpline (1-866-331-9474)\n\nAlways prioritize your safety and well-being.

Characteristics of Attachment Strange Situation Assessment Attachment Through Life Secure Attachment Style Ambivalent Attachment Style Avoidant Attachment Style Disorganized Attachment Style Take the Attachment Style Quiz 1. Bowlby shared the psychoanalytic view that early experiences in childhood are important for influencing development and behavior later in life. He believed that attachment had an evolutionary component; it aids in survival. He believed that this propensity to make strong emotional bonds with specific individuals was an essential part of human nature. 2. The expectations formed during that period tend to remain relatively unchanged for the rest of the person's life. 3. In other words, children develop expectations that their caregivers will be responsive to their needs because, in their experience, their caregivers have been responsive in the past. 4. Ainsworth's Strange Situation Assessment followed this basic sequence: The parent and child are alone in a room. 5. The study involved observing children between the ages of 12 to 18 months responding to a situation in which they were briefly left alone and then reunited with their mother. 6. Before you start blaming relationship problems on your parents, it is important to note that attachment styles formed during early childhood are not necessarily identical to those demonstrated in adult romantic attachments. 7. In one study, researchers found that parental divorce seemed unrelated to attachment style. 8. Parental divorce or abandonment is linked to more negative feelings about romantic relationships as a higher likelihood of having an anxious and avoidant attachment style. 9. These children can be comforted to some extent by other people in the absence of a parent or caregiver, but they clearly prefer parents to strangers. 10. Mothers who respond inconsistently or who interfere with a child's activities tend to produce infants who explore less, cry more, and are more anxious. 11. Mothers who consistently reject or ignore their infant's needs tend to produce children who try to avoid contact. 12. In a classic study by Hazan and Shaver, 56% of respondents identified themselves as secure, while 25% identified as avoidant, and 19% identified as ambivalent anxious. 13. Ambivalently attached adults report falling in love often. 14. Avoidantly attached adults describe love as rare and temporary. 15. Research has shown that securely attached children are more empathetic during later stages of childhood. 16. These children are also described as less disruptive, less aggressive, and more mature than children with ambivalent or avoidant attachment styles. 17. Hazan and Shaver noted that securely attached adults tend to have trusting, long-term relationships. 18. Securely attached individuals enjoy intimate relationships, seek out social support, and share feelings with other people. 19. Research has also shown that adults with an avoidant attachment style are more accepting and likely to engage in casual sex. 20. Adults with a disorganized attachment style exhibit a confusing mix of anxious and avoidant behaviors in relationships. 21. People with a disorganized style may seek out a loving relationship and then suddenly push the other person away. 22. They often sabotage their relationships and have a hard time trusting their partners.\n\nAction: paraphrase and add Markdown formatting\n\n**Attachment Styles**\n===============\n\nAttachment styles are patterns that emerge in our earliest emotional bonds with caregivers.

These children display considerable distress when separated from a parent or caregiver but do not seem reassured or comforted by the parent's return.\n\n*   May be wary of strangers\n*   Become greatly distressed when parents leave\n*   Do not appear comforted when parents return\n\n### **Avoidant Attachment Style**\n\nChildren with avoidant attachment styles tend to avoid parents and caregivers. This avoidance often becomes especially pronounced after a period of absence.\n\n*   May avoid parents\n*   Do not seek much contact or comfort from parents\n*   Show little or no preference for parents over strangers\n\n### **Disorganized Attachment Style**\n\nChildren with a disorganized-insecure attachment style show a lack of clear attachment behavior. Their actions and responses to caregivers are often a mix of behaviors, including avoidance or resistance.\n\n*   At Age 1: Show a mixture of avoidant and resistant behavior\n*   May seem dazed, confused, or apprehensive\n*   At Age 6: May take on a parental role\n\n**Take the Attachment Style Quiz**\n-----------------------------------\n\nIf you're unsure about your attachment style, this fast and free quiz can help you identify what your thoughts and behaviors may say about your attachment.\n\n1.
