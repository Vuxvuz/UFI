So give yourself some grace.\n*   Never evaluate your life when you're tired.\n*   Remember you're more than you give yourself credit for.\n\n**Discipline & Personal Growth**\n\n1.  Get disciplined with at least one key thing in your life and stay consistent with it.\n2.  This practice of discipline in one area will carry over to other areas of your life.\n3.  Cultivate a mindset of lifelong learning.\n4.  Motivation comes and goes but discipline keeps you moving.\n5.  Keep showing up, even when you don't feel like it.\n6.  If it's worth doing, it's worth doing it badly.\n7.  If you can't handle doing it perfectly or finish it, half-ass it at least.\n8.  If you stop using a skill, you lose it-whether it's physical strength, knowledge, social skills, or anything else.\n9.

You're probably tired.\n*   Feel like you hate everyone? You're probably hungry.\n\n**Boundaries & Lifestyle Choices**\n\n1.  Turn off work email notifications on your phone when you're not at work.\n2.  Leaving a toxic job for one with healthy work-life boundaries can be life-changing.\n3.  When work is over, leave it behind-mentally and physically.\n4.  Be the kind of supportive, loving parent to yourself that you may not have had growing up.\n5.  Deleting social media apps like Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok can be liberating.\n\n**Relationships & Integrity**\n\n*   Keeping gossip and lying to a minimum-white lies too.\n*   Be honest about your inner world.\n*   Saying something like, I'm not upset with you, my brain is just being difficult right now, can prevent conflict and clear the air.\n*   You can't control other people, only how you respond to them.\n*   Don't take criticism from people whose advice you wouldn't seek out.\n\n**Daily Habits & Rituals**\n\n1.  Wake up early while the world is still quiet-the peaceful reflection time is invaluable.\n2.  Take time to notice and appreciate small, everyday moments.\n3.  Self-care isn't always cozy comfort, sometimes it's giving yourself a pep talk and doing the hard things you've been avoiding.\n\n**The Value of Online Peer Support**\n\n*   Listening to advice or other perspectives when things are tough can help you gain some insight you wouldn't otherwise have.\n*   However, suggestions like these, from sources like Reddit, are never a substitute for therapy or clinical treatment, and not all of them might be applicable to you or possible for you. Keep that in mind as you peruse this list! You Are Enough Just as You Are-but It's OK To Seek Self-Improvement Too Read More: LIVING WELL SELF-IMPROVEMENT See Our Editorial Process Meet Our Review Board Share Feedback & Report a Concern 33 Reddit-Approved Tips for Self-Improvement and Better Mental Health Vetted by the experts By Team Verywell Mind Published on April 10, 2025 d3sign Getty Images Consider these common scenarios: You've been trying to build healthier habits but can't seem to make anything stick. You keep hearing about all the benefits of meditation but you're really not sure if it's working. Your friend keeps canceling plans and you're starting to wonder if you should end the friendship. What do they all have in common? They're probably things you'd ask about on Reddit. Medically reviewed publications like Verywell Mind and others can be massively helpful during times of need, but so often what we really crave during our late-night-panic-googling session is personal experience. While we certainly don't recommend Reddit as your sole source of wellness advice, it can help to get some additional crowd-sourced perspective from real people. Thus, we scoured some of the most popular mental health-centric subreddits-such as r selfimprovement, r mentalhealth, and r motivation-to bring you this list of oft-repeated wellness tips, tricks, and pearls of wisdom that struck the biggest chord among Redditors. Mindset & Self-Perception Advice like the following encouraged folks dealing with negativity or self-esteem issues to keep things in the proper perspective: No one thinks about you nearly as much as you think about yourself. Ask yourself, What would someone who truly loved themselves do right now? It's okay if growth takes time-the time will pass either way. If you can't beat the fear, just do it scared. Treat yourself with patience and kindness. Avoid negative self-talk, and speak to yourself like someone you care about. Remember, your toughest critic is you. So give yourself some grace. Never evaluate your life when you're tired. Remember you're more than you give yourself credit for. Discipline & Personal Growth Redditors in search of motivation found these tips to be some of the best ways to stay on the path of self-improvement: Get disciplined with at least one key thing in your life and stay consistent with it. This practice of discipline in one area will carry over to other areas of your life. Cultivate a mindset of lifelong learning. Motivation comes and goes but discipline keeps you moving. Keep showing up, even when you don't feel like it. If it's worth doing, it's worth doing it badly. If you can't handle doing it perfectly or finish it, half-ass it at least. If you stop using a skill, you lose it-whether it's physical strength, knowledge, social skills, or anything else. Pay attention to how you're moving through life and try to be mindful of all that you do. Physical & Mental Well-being While these might seem like obvious pieces of advice that you've heard a million times before-whether on Reddit or IRL-there's good reason for that; they actually work. Get at least 8 hours of sleep a night as often as possible. Exercise. Exercise is the foundation of almost every other good habit. Eat breakfast-seriously. A combination of daily movement and sunshine (vitamin D) does wonders. Relax your jaw, drop your shoulders, close your eyes, and take a few long, deep breaths. Feel like everyone hates you? You're probably tired. Feel like you hate everyone? You're probably hungry.",

    "content": "on This Article Leave a comment to share your thoughts, provide feedback or ask questions related to this article.\n\nHere is the content formatted using Markdown headings and list structure:\n\n**9 Expert-Recommended Productivity Tips That Sound Silly But Actually Work**\n\nThese tricks might seem counterintuitive, but they work-trust us\n\n**Table of Contents**\n1. Trick Your Brain with Tiny Steps\n2. Blast Your Hype Playlist\n3. Count Down Like You're About to Dance\n4. Ditch the To-Do List for a Calendar\n5. Use Music Like a Task Timer\n6. Rate Tasks by Intensity, Not Importance\n7. Move First, Think Later\n8. Narrate Your Day Like a Sports Commentator\n9. Celebrate Every Micro-Win\n\nIf you've ever found yourself swearing you'll start that task right after this one video (or snack, or scroll), you're not alone-and you're definitely not lazy. Sometimes, the best way to jumpstart productivity is to lean into unconventional (even silly-sounding) strategies that actually work with your brain instead of fighting against it.\n\nHere, we're sharing productivity tips that might make you raise an eyebrow-but mental health experts, coaches, and real-life humans say they work wonders.\n\n**1. Trick Your Brain with Tiny Steps**\n\nTherapist Risa Williams, LMFT, author of The Procrastination Playbook, swears by this sneaky psychological trick: make the first step laughably small. Make it sound so easy that your brain has trouble resisting doing it, says Williams.\n\nInstead of telling yourself you have to write a chapter, tell yourself all you have to do is open the document and type the title.\n\n*   - RISA WILLIAMS, LMFT\n*   And that's it. Seriously.\n*   Then you close the laptop.\n*   Oddly enough, most of us end up doing more than we planned-because getting started is the hardest part.\n*   Williams calls this the Ridiculously Easy First Step technique, and it's magic for overcoming the pressure of perfectionism.\n\n**2. Blast Your Hype Playlist**\n\nYou know that one song that makes you instantly dance like no one's watching? That's the energy we're looking for here. Sam Dylan Finch, a neuro-affirming peer support coach with AuDHD, calls this their Hype Playlist strategy-and it's not just about playing bops.\n\nThey need to be songs that, if you heard them at a wedding, you'd be dashing to the dance floor instinctually, Finch explains.\n\n*   It's nostalgic, upbeat music that literally gets you into your body and moves you.\n*   According to Finch, the combination of music and nostalgia engages our reward processing system and supports emotional regulation.1\n*   Finch recommends playing your hype playlist the moment you catch yourself stuck in a distraction loop-whether you're doomscrolling or procrastinating on basic self-care.\n*   By letting the music jolt you into movement, you're leveraging dopamine and body awareness to support emotional regulation and task-switching.\n*   Finch's own playlist includes songs like Cotton Eye Joe and the Pokémon theme.\n\n**3. Count Down Like You're About to Dance**\n\nFeeling paralyzed before starting something? Say it with us: 5, 6-5, 6, 7, 8!\n\nThis one pairs well with your Hype Playlist. Finch encourages clients to use verbal cues like 3, 2, 1-LET'S GO! or dance-style countdowns.\n\n*   Add a physical motion-stand up, clap, shake out your arms-and suddenly you're in motion.\n*   This tip is similar to the five-second rule for procrastination, popularized by Mel Robbins.\n*   You count down from five, and then you do the thing.\n*   This is what's called an 'interstitial action,' Finch explains.\n*   We're physically signaling to ourselves that we're ending the previous activity and moving on to something else.\n\n**4. Ditch the To-Do List for a Calendar**\n\nFor the past few years, I've been following a planning method called Power Planning. It was designed by Sam Laura Brown, a perfectionism coach who runs a podcast called The Perfectionism Project.\n\nInstead of working straight from a to-do list, I take an hour a week to schedule all my tasks into my Google calendar.\n\n*   If plans change, I can always tweak my calendar to adjust to the new plan.\n*   It's kinda like time blocking-but better.\n*   This helps because:\n    *   It's realistic. When you have to fit everything into a calendar, you have to be more realistic about your time.\n    *   This means you're less likely to overload yourself with work.\n    *   It eliminates decision fatigue.\n    *   I don't have to stare at my to-do list and figure out what to do first-instead, I consult my plan and work on that.\n    *   It's adaptable. Power Planning is built to be flexible.\n\n**5. Use Music Like a Task Timer**\n\nIf you can dance your way through a task, why not soundtrack your productivity? Williams recommends using a task playlist -one or two upbeat songs-to give yourself a set amount of time to clean, sort paperwork, or power through emails.\n\n*   We can use this for tasks and chores we need to do, she says.\n*   Pick a playlist that gets the energy going... it can feel more fun than just using a timer.\n*   It's different to a Hype Playlist, as you're using the task playlist as a timer and not just a general feel-good playlist.\n\n**6. Rate Tasks by Intensity, Not Importance**\n\nSometimes it's not about time management-it's stress management. Williams suggests breaking a task into smaller steps and rating them by intensity -a tool she details in her book, Get Stuff Done Without the Stress.\n\n*   This pairs well with the Ridiculously Easy First Step, but takes it further.\n*   You can rate tasks or pieces of the task in this way, she says, and then tackle the low-intensity parts first.\n*   This way, you start with the parts that feel easiest, giving you a win and some momentum before you face the hard stuff.\n\n**7. Move First, Think Later**\n\nOverthinking often sabotages productivity. Instead, try using your body to lead the way. This one's backed by Finch's movement-based interstitial action trick-but it's also a strategy many neurodivergent folks use instinctively.\n\n*   Need to write an email? Walk in a circle first.\n*   Need to fold laundry? Do one stretch or body shake.\n*   It sounds silly. But if you try it, you might be surprised at how just moving disrupts the I'm stuck loop.\n\n**8. Narrate Your Day Like a Sports Commentator**\n\nOkay, bear with us. If you live alone-or don't mind sounding weird-try narrating your actions aloud.\n\n*   This might sound wild, but I narrate my tasks like I'm on a cooking show: 'OK, we're going to rinse the mug now... excellent technique!'\n*   I feel less like I'm doing chores and more like I'm starring in a cozy reality show.\n*",

Whether caused by a disagreement in values or simple miscommunication, we all encounter conflict at some point in our lives. Unfortunately, when conflict is not addressed productively, it can escalate, sometimes to the point of violence.1 Emotions are contagious. When we encounter someone who is experiencing stress, we pick up on their stress.2 The same is true for other emotions, including anger, which is why we might feed off of someone else's anger, causing a conflict to escalate further. In the workplace, unresolved conflict leads to less creativity and productivity,3 and interpersonal relationship conflict can destroy relationships, including friendships and marriages.

How can you resolve something if you do not know what that looks like? Understand each person's perception of the problem and desired resolution beforehand.\n\n*   Ask yourself, \"How will I know that this is resolved?\"\n*   What change would make things right for you?\n*   Do you need to see a specific behavior change?\n*   Do you feel wronged and need an apology?\n\n**Remain Calm and Regulated**\n\nThe longer a conflict has gone on, the bigger your feelings about it and the other person are likely to be. While your feelings are valid, they can interfere with your ability to communicate and address the conflict in a productive way.\n\n*   Make sure you are in a calm headspace when addressing a conflict.\n*   It is possible for big feelings to come up during the conversation, so be aware of this possibility, and use coping skills as needed to regulate yourself.\n*   Sometimes a conflict is complex and needs long-term work in finding a solution.\n\n**Practice Active Listening and Take Turns**\n\nOften, each person has a different perception of the conflict and what resolution is needed. It can be tempting to cling to our perception of what is going on and not address the other person's side.\n\n*   Make sure that both sides have the opportunity to speak their truth.\n*   Actively listen when the other person is sharing.\n*   When expressing your side of the conflict, use neutral language and I statements to reduce the risk of further escalation.\n\n**Engage With a Third Party**\n\nA neutral third party or mediator can aid in conflict resolution. Since they are not directly involved in the conflict itself, they do not have an emotional investment in the outcome.\n\n*   A mediator can help both parties see an acceptable resolution.\n*   If your conflict is in a relationship, a mental health professional may be able to provide resolution support through couples therapy.\n*   If your conflict is with a colleague, your workplace may employ trained mediators to help you come to an appropriate resolution.\n\n**Compromise**\n\nAs noted above, it is tempting to get caught up in our perception of a conflict and vision of an appropriate resolution, forgetting that there is another side to the story.\n\n*   Recognize your values as well as what you might be able to bend in order to come to a solution that is mutually agreeable.\n*   The other party's needs might align more closely with yours than you think.\n*   When you are open to compromise, you can more easily find an appropriate resolution to your conflict.\n\n**Resources That Can Help You Deal With Conflict**\n\nSometimes, you might need outside help to manage or de-escalate a conflict. Even if you take steps to diffuse the situation, the other party might not be receptive or may choose to continue to escalate regardless of your efforts.\n\n*   Workplace conflict: Consult your job's human resources department.\n*   Conflict with your partner: If you and your partner are struggling with conflict, a couples therapist can help you work through it.\n*   Divorce: Sometimes, the safest or healthiest option in a marriage is to end the relationship. Professional mediators can help work through conflicts impeding a divorce proceeding.\n*   Family conflict: If members of your family are struggling with conflict, a marriage and family therapist or another qualified mental health professional can help you work through and build appropriate communication skills.\n*   Conflict among friends: Even the best of friends disagree sometimes. Involving a neutral third party can help you work through the disagreement and communicate effectively.\n\nRemember that you can only control your response to the conflict and not the other person's, but you can use these tips to make de-escalation as painless as possible.

This can be due to physical and emotional insecurities that a person may have. While it may seem harmless, it's an unhealthy way to deal with insecurities and can cause strain on your relationships with family, friends, and even strangers.\n\n[2] Personality disorders such as Narcissistic personality disorder, Borderline personality disorder, and Histrionic personality disorder could also be the cause of attention-seeking behavior. Some people may exhibit extreme emotional reactions due to these disorders.\n\n[3] Other mental health conditions like ADHD, anxiety, and bipolar disorder can also lead to a person displaying attention-seeking behaviors.\n\nThe first step to stopping needing attention is recognizing that you display attention-seeking behaviors. It's essential to work on building self-confidence and ridding yourself of insecurities to overcome this issue. This can be achieved by going to therapy, keeping a journal, or building your self-esteem through daily positive affirmations and surrounding yourself with supportive people.\n\nIf you have a friend or loved one who constantly needs attention, you can help them become aware of their behavior by setting boundaries, communicating with them, being understanding, and asking for professional help if necessary.

[7] Some people who need attention don't realize that they're exhibiting attention-seeking behaviors. Attention-seeking people express their desire for attention in varying ways. These signs include faking helplessness, causing conflict, constantly looking for sympathy from others, needing to be complimented, and lying and embellishing stories.  [8] The first step to stop needing attention is recognizing that you display attention-seeking behaviors. Working on building self-confidence and ridding yourself of insecurities is a significant first step to helping you stop craving attention. Here are some ways you can build confidence:   -   Go to therapy: Speaking to a professional is the best way to deal with insecurities and build confidence.\n    -   Keep a journal: Becoming more self-aware of your attention-seeking behavior goes a long way in helping you get over them. Keeping a daily journal can help you achieve more self-awareness when you track your behaviors.\n    -   Build your self-esteem: For many people, the need to always be the center of attention stems from low self-esteem. However, attention-seeking behaviors do nothing to help you build healthy self-esteem. Using daily positive affirmations and surrounding yourself with genuinely supportive people is a great place to start.\n\n- **How to Deal With a Person Who Constantly Needs Attention**\n  *   Set boundaries: Indulging the whims of a person who continually seeks attention only fuels their need for attention.\n  *   Communicate with them: Sometimes, a person seeking attention might not know they are acting in a way that draws attention. Take them aside and gently communicate any issues you're noticing.\n  *   Be understanding: Attention-seekers often act out for a deeper reason than simply needing attention. They may have an underlying mental health disorder or have self-esteem or image problems.\n\n- **References**\n  *   https://www.healthline.com/health/personality-disorders\n  *   https://www.healthline.com/health/narcissistic-personality-disorder-symptoms-traits\n  *   https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety-disorders-and-treatment\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n*   Signs\n    - Faking helplessness\n    - Causing conflict\n    - Constantly looking for sympathy from others\n    - Needing to be complimented\n    - Lying and embellishing stories\n*   Causes\n  1.

    "content": "Last Modified on February 20, 2025\n\n**I Tried Junk Journaling For a Month-Here's What Happened**\n\nIf you hate traditional journaling, here's an alternative that may work for you\n\nBy Noma Nazish Updated on February 20, 2025\nNoma Nazish Verywell Mind Table of Contents\n\nMy Weekly Junk Journaling Experience\n\nWhy Junk Journaling Works\n\nShould You Try Junk Journaling?\n\nAlternatives to Junk Journaling\n\nI must admit I never gave much thought to the odd bits of everyday junk like receipts, coupons, flyers, stamps, or product tags before tossing them in the trash. That is until I stumbled upon the latest self-care trend sweeping social media: junk journaling.\n\nJunk journaling might sound like an oxymoron, but that's what sets it apart. Instead of being a place to organize your thoughts or to-do list, it's a place to organize all your (you guessed it) junk. Think of it as the less structured, more laidback cousin of traditional journaling and scrapbooking.\n\nPart of the fun is that there are no rules. And in a world that constantly demands productivity, perfection, and constant engagement, this freeform practice might just be the respite our mental health needs.\n\nGiven the promising stress-busting benefits and practically no barrier to entry, the self-care nerd in me naturally had to try it out. Ahead, find out how the process went for me and whether or not the hype rang true.\n\nPsychologists Swear This One Thing Can Help Cure Your Chronic Stress\n\nMy Weekly Junk Journaling Experience\nTo stay as close to the theme as possible, I decided to create my own notebook for this experiment by repurposing discarded scraps. You can see a couple pages from my journal at the top of this article. I used an old wedding card to make the notebook cover and cut and stapled old newspaper sheets, paper bags, and leftover wrapping paper to make the pages. Pretty cool, right?\n\nHere's how it went from there:\n\n1.  Week 1: Getting started felt the hardest despite my excitement about trying something new.\n2.  Week 2: Now that I didn't set any expectations for the weekly spread, the ideas came more naturally.\n3.  Week 3: I turned to more unusual scraps like withered leaves from the backyard and ended up with a cutesy nature-themed collage.\n4.  Week 4: By this time, I also noticed I felt more present when doing even ordinary things like eating a snack or putting away groceries.\n\nWhy Junk Journaling Works\n\nAfter noticing all the positive effects, I wondered-is there actual science behind this? To find out, I tapped experts to get the scoop on how creative outlets like junk journaling can improve our mental well-being. Here's what they shared:\n\n1.  It May Lower Stress And Anxiety: There is something incredibly freeing about not worrying if your handwriting is neat or your thoughts make sense.\n2.  It Promotes Mindfulness: The tactile, creative process of picking, cutting, and pasting different materials encourages mindfulness, grounding you in the present moment.\n3.  It Helps Cultivate Gratitude And Joy: Junk journaling invites you to find meaning in seemingly insignificant items.\n\nShould You Try Junk Journaling?\n\nSince junk journaling focuses on creative self-expression rather than skill, it's suitable for people of all ages and artistic abilities, says Barton. It's particularly helpful for those who struggle with perfectionism as it promotes free and non-judgmental creative exploration, she adds. It's also beneficial for anyone dealing with grief or trauma as it provides a safe space to explore and process difficult emotions that may be hard to put into words.\n\nAlternatives to Junk Journaling\n\nIf junk journaling is not quite your thing, no worries! Several alternative activities offer comparable mental health benefits. For example:\n\n*   Coloring\n*   Bullet Journaling\n*   Collage Making\n*   Clay Modeling\n*   Diamond Art\n*   Gardening\n*   Knitting\n*   Crocheting\n*   Zentangling\n\nThe key is to choose a creative outlet that feels natural and enjoyable to you-one that gives your brain a break while also helping you express yourself, says Anderson.\n\nTakeaway\n\nWill I keep junk journaling after this month-long experiment? Absolutely. It may have started as a curious dip into a TikTok trend, but I can see junk journaling as a fun addition to my self-care toolkit-one that has helped me slow down, be more present, and more grateful for life's little moments.\n\nAm I suggesting everyone should start junk journaling, though? Not necessarily. Self-care is like Cinderella's shoe, one size doesn't fit all. Like the experts said, choose what resonates with you the most.

    "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/can-a-greens-powder-boost-your-energy-11708109",
    "content": "on This Article **The Greens Powder Experiment**\n\nA greens powder can help balance out a vitamin deficiency, but can it boost your energy? bee32 Getty Images\n\n**What's in a Greens Powder, Anyway?**\n\nWhen I think of a green vegetable-based drink, I imagine a bunch of random leafy foods blended together into a dark green sludge that is very nutritious-if you can stomach it. Like something Rocky Balboa would drink after downing some raw eggs for breakfast.\n\nThankfully, a greens powder drink is not that. The powder I tested was extremely tasty-so what's in it? The greens powder blend contains the following ingredients, all organic:\n\n1. Barley grass\n2. Kale\n3. Alfalfa\n4. Wheatgrass\n5. Oat grass\n6. Lemon juice\n7. Chlorella\n8. Astragalus\n\nIt may read like a list of things you wouldn't want to drink, but the final product tasted good. I do feel compelled to note that, as far as I can tell, this wild strawberry kiwi powder contains neither strawberry nor kiwi. The combination of additional ingredients like pomegranate juice, monk fruit extract, and other natural flavors did the trick, however, without sugar or artificial sweeteners like aspartame.\n\nFinally, this powder is labeled as gluten-free, vegan-friendly, and non-GMO. If you're looking to try a greens powder, you should always read the label, says Eliza Savage, MS, RD, CDN.\n\nShe stresses the importance of confirming the following:\n\n1. That you recognize what all the ingredients are\n2. That you aren't ingesting something that may interact with medications you're taking (especially if the product contains herbs or botanicals)\n3. That the product is third-party tested or has a trusted certification such as NSF, USP, or Informed-Choice\n4. That additional ingredients, such as probiotics or digestive enzymes, are not duplicative with other supplements you may already be taking\n\nBe sure that you know exactly what is in your product.\n\n*   ELIZA SAVAGE, MS, RD, CDN\n\n**Greens Powder Benefits**\n\nThe goal of my experiment was to help boost my energy, so while I'm focusing on that, I will mention that this and many greens powders also purport to help with things like gut health and immune support. As with all supplements, any statements regarding the potential benefits of this greens powder have not been evaluated or approved by the FDA.\n\nIt's essential to talk to your doctor before incorporating any supplement into your diet.\n\nOn the nutrient front, the powder boasts hefty servings of vitamin C (100% of the recommended daily value), vitamin D (100% DV), and vitamin B12 (420% DV).\n\nWhile it is generally preferable to get your nutrients through food rather than supplementation, we all know that's not always possible. A lot of research has investigated the impact of deficiency in these vitamins, and how supplementation or increasing your intake can help:\n\n1.  Research suggests that a moderate deficiency in vitamin C, found in citrus and other foods, can lead to an increased risk of physical fatigue as well as a higher risk of poorer mental health outcomes.\n2.  B vitamins, including B12, help your body convert food into energy, and are often connected to brain function. B vitamin deficiencies can potentially lead to impaired memory, mood changes, and cognitive issues.\n3.  Research supports the fact that vitamins like B12, C, and D can indirectly impact energy levels and fatigue, says Savage.\n\nIf you have a deficiency in one of these nutrients, you may feel tired, as each is involved in energy metabolism and creation.\n\n**Should You Try It?**\n\nIf you work a 9 to 5 job-especially one that doesn't have you moving around much-you may be resigned to facing an afternoon slump day after day. But it doesn't have to be that way! If you think you might benefit from the same kind of boost I was aiming for without loading up on caffeine and sugar, a greens powder is worth a shot-as long as your doctor gives you the OK.\n\nIf you aren't already loading up on vitamin supplements, this should be a safe option. Savage reminds us that the effects are far from guaranteed. If you aren't already deficient in these nutrients, you may not notice the 'boost,' she says.\n\nI always recommend working with a healthcare practitioner to determine if you have a deficiency, and if so, how to best treat it.\n\nAs for cost-this particular powder costs about $60 for a 30-serving bag. At $2 per serving, it's more expensive than a home-brewed cup of coffee but cheaper than the average Dunkin' or Starbucks coffee, so it won't break the bank if you typically rely on the latter for your afternoon energy fix.\n\n**Alternative Options**\n\nIn general, Savage urges caution with the many supplements on the market that tout energy-boosting benefits. I recommend steering clear, she says. Instead, opt for something that contains caffeine, like a cup of coffee or a kombucha, which can give you a boost.\n\nIf that causes you jitters, maybe matcha. Don't neglect the other quick (and free!) midday energy boosters that are available to you as well.\n\nA quick walk outside your home or your workplace-or really any form of body movement-can do wonders to reinvigorate you. Additionally, many times people feel fatigue when they are actually dehydrated, Savage says. Grab a glass of water and drink up. You'll feel more energized instantly-or you'll at least have to take a walk to the bathroom that will get your energy up and at 'em!\n\nSo whatever kind of midday slump you may be dealing with, there are plenty of options out there to help give you the boost you need to get through the day upright.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\nAs someone who tends to be a skeptic of anything in the realm of natural remedies, I wouldn't be calling my greens powder test a success if I hadn't experienced some tangible benefits. If you're looking for an entry point into the world of vitamin supplementation, I'd recommend this option based on my experience.\n\nBut given the evidence, I'll also take a look at my diet to see if I might be vitamin-deficient. Think of a greens powder like a Band-Aid, Savage says. It may cover your nutritional bases for a bit, but it will not replace the need to eat your fruits and vegetables.\n\nCommit to getting enough sleep, water, and a healthy, balanced diet.

As you might suspect, our conversations impact our relationships, and can do so positively or negatively depending on how they go.\n\n*   Our conversations mark the difference between healthy, stable relationships and those that might not survive long-term.\n*   They could even end our relationships.\n*   Over time, these mistakes can contribute to people feeling misunderstood, and others may eventually avoid conversations altogether.\n\n**Common Mistakes in Conversations**\n\nHere are the most common mistakes we might make regardless of our communication style.\n\n1.  **Boomerasking**: Have you ever asked a question just to have the opportunity to answer it yourself? This faux pas isn't just unkind; boomerasking can make us seem manipulative since we're only bringing up a topic for someone else to discuss before we do.\n2.  **Interrupting**: It can be challenging to stay silent when you have something to say. There are some relationships in which both parties are interrupters who don't mind when it happens, but that's more the exception than the norm.\n3.  **Talking Too Much About Oneself**: We've all heard the stories-or experienced them firsthand-about bad dates where the other party won't stop droning on about their own life.\n4.  **Excessive Advice**: When a friend or loved one comes to us with a problem, it's natural to want to help them fix it-but they may just want to vent.\n5.  **Asking Closed-Ended Questions**: Asking questions is vital to a good conversation, but we want to ensure that those questions pave the way rather than create stop signs.\n6.  **Not Asking Follow-Up Questions**: When we hear a person's response to our question, it should naturally lead us to want to know something more about at least one element of what they've said.\n7.  **Interrogation**: We've discussed that a conversation should be a back-and-forth exchange, so bombarding a person with nonstop questions is something to avoid.\n8.  **Using Dismissive Language**: The biggest mistake one can make is essentially lacking respect for the other person when having a conversation.\n\n**Strategies to Avoid Conversation Mistakes**\n\nThankfully, we can get past these mistakes to start having better and more functional discussions.\n\n*   To avoid any and all of the above mistakes is simple: to listen openly and behave respectfully.\n*   We should listen with curiosity and acknowledge what the person has said. Help them unfold their thoughts instead of imposing your own.\n*   Active listening is considered a basic key to better communication.\n*   Giving a brief synopsis of what the other person said can help you correct any potential errors quickly and prevent misunderstandings.\n*   Avoid conflict by using affirming language and operating from a place of curiosity. Ask follow-up questions and if you disagree use neutral language instead of hostility.\n\n**Promoting Healthy and Balanced Conversations**\n\nWe can avoid these mistakes by being more present in our conversations.\n\n*   When we behave respectfully and genuinely want to know more about someone else's experience, it's easy to avoid talking over them or speaking nonstop about ourselves.\n*   Listen with the real intent to understand, express yourself without attack or defense, and don't leap to strategies before you understand what really matters on both sides of the conversation.\n\n**If You Happen to Make One of These Mistakes**\n\nIt's not too late: You can still turn things around. For example, Caspersen says that if we find ourselves offering unsolicited advice, instead of saying Well, what you should do is.... you can instead say, So, it sounds like [this] has been happening, what's the hardest thing in that for you? What are you trying to figure out right now?\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nCommunication errors like interrogating the other party or asking only close-ended questions can wreak havoc on relationships, but we can avoid them by being present, listening actively, staying engaged, and getting more information before jumping to conclusions or assumptions.\n\n**Resources**\n\nIf you'd like to practice your conversational skills, there are worksheets you can use or videos you can watch from communication experts. Whichever method you choose, better conversations can be on the horizon for you. 50 Deep Conversation Starters for Meaningful Connections Read More: LIVING WELL RELATIONSHIPS STRENGTHENING RELATIONSHIPS\n\n**Meet Our Review Board**\n\nAriane Resnick, CNC is a mental health writer, certified nutritionist, and wellness author who advocates for accessibility and inclusivity.\n\nShare Feedback or Suggest an Article Leave a comment.
