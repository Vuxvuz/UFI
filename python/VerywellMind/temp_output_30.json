    "content": "& References Page Footer Navigation Bar 1. https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn1572 Last edited by John C. Umhau, MD, MPH, CPE on July 23, 2024. \n**Addiction**\n\nAddiction is a disorder characterized by the compulsive use of a substance or activity that triggers our reward systems despite experiencing adverse consequences.\n\nA person's genes and environment influence this complex condition. Addiction is widely viewed as a brain disease due to how it impacts the **brain's reward, pleasure, and self-control circuits**. In the past, addiction was thought to only encompass substance abuse, but the definition has been expanded to include activities like gambling as well as gaming, shopping, and exercise.\n\nIt's also important to note that addiction is about the underlying neurology of the brain and not about the outward behaviors. With appropriate treatment, people with addictions can go on to live happy, healthy lives.\n\n**Understanding Addiction**\n\n*   Can Tapering Off Alcohol Prevent Withdrawal?\n*   What Does It Mean to Be Sober Curious?\n*   Can Self-Improvement Feel Like Too Much of a Good Thing?\n\n**The Symptoms Used to Diagnose Substance Use Disorders**\n\n1.  The inability to control the use of the substance\n2.  Continued use despite adverse consequences\n3.  Withdrawal symptoms when trying to stop using the substance\n4.  Tolerance, needing more of the substance to feel the same effects\n5.  Neglecting important activities or relationships due to the substance use\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n1.  Is addiction a disease?\n    *   Yes, addiction is a treatable, chronic disease that affects the brain's reward, motivation, memory, and related circuitry.\n2.  What causes addiction?\n    *   People engage in potentially addictive activities to feel pleasure, and over time, the reinforcing effect of these activities may change brain chemistry to create an unconscious drive to continue the behavior.\n\n**Breaking an Addiction**\n\nThe first step in overcoming addiction is to desire change and avoid the people, places, and things which promote the addiction. Support groups, mentors, and 12-step programs provide help, while counselors, recovery centers, and physicians provide expertise and medication to treat cravings and the effects of withdrawal. Eating healthy and getting exercise also play an important role in recovery.\n\n**Is Addiction Genetic?**\n\nA person's genetics account for about half of their risk for developing an addiction. The impact of genetics is influenced by an interaction between a person's environment, diet, and biology. Alcoholism, like other addictions, tends to run in families, and members of those families are at increased risk for developing alcoholism.\n\n**Key Terms**\n\n*   Substance Use Disorder: A psychiatric condition that involves the compulsion to use a drug or alcohol despite the development of adverse consequences.\n*   Behavioral Addiction: A pleasurable activity changes the brain and drives a person to engage compulsively in the activity despite harmful consequences.\n*   Intervention: An organized attempt by family members or friends to confront a loved one about how their addictive behavior has affected them.\n\n**Comorbidity**\n\nComorbidity refers to the presence of more than one distinct condition in an individual. A common example is when someone with a mental illness also has a substance use disorder. Neither condition causes the other, and successful treatment will often address both conditions at the same time.\n\n**Explore Addiction**\n\n*   Why Emotional Sobriety Is a Critical Part of Your Recovery Journey\n*   What Does It Take to Get Sober?\n*   3 People Share How They Coped\n*   Understanding Enabler Behavior: Motivations, Signs, and Strategies for Change\n*   Redefining Sobriety: The Rise of the California Sober Lifestyle\n*   The 8 Best Online Psychiatry Services That Take Insurance, Tried and Tested\n\n**Conditions A-Z**\n\n*   Neurodivergence\n*   Phobias\n*   Anxiety\n*   Kids' Mental Health\n*   ADHD\n*   Eating Disorders\n*   Bipolar Disorder\n*   BPD\n*   Depression\n*   Neurological Disorders\n*   PTSD\n*   OCD\n*   Panic Disorder\n*   Schizophrenia\n\nPage Sources & References:\n\n1.  https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn1572\nLast edited by John C.

What Is Metta Meditation?\n2. Benefits\n3. Getting Started\n4. Techniques\n5. Challenges\n6. Integrating Metta Meditation Into Daily Life\n\n### What Is Metta Meditation?\n\nMetta meditation, also known as loving-kindness meditation, focuses on cultivating love, compassion, and feelings of well-being for oneself and others.\n\n*   Buddha originally taught this kind of meditation over 2600 years ago.\n*   Buddhists still practice it to this day.\n*   Loving-kindness meditation is the first part of the Four Brahma Vihara meditations that the Buddha taught to promote positive emotions:\n\n    *   Metta (loving-kindness)\n    *   Karuna (compassion)\n    *   Mudita (appreciative joy)\n    *   Uppekha (equanimity)\n\n### Benefits\n\nMetta meditation promotes positive feelings like joy, trust, gratitude, happiness, and compassion-all of which, according to metta meditation practice, you're supposed to feel unconditionally for yourself and others.\n\n*   Promote self-compassion\n*   Decrease anxiety and stress\n*   Be incorporated into cognitive-behavioral therapy to treat depression and social anxiety\n*   Help reduce symptoms of mood disorders\n*   Reduce physical and chronic pain\n*   Enhance social connections\n\n### Getting Started\n\n1.  Sit in a comfortable and relaxed position.\n2.  Take two or three deep breaths to center yourself-feel or imagine your breath moving through your chest, around your heart area.\n3.  Acknowledge any stress or negative feelings you might be holding on to, and try to let them go.\n\n### Techniques\n\n1.  Loving Kindness Toward Yourself\n    *   Choose a mantra of loving kindness to repeat to yourself as you breathe:\n        +   May I feel happy.\n        +   May I be at peace.\n        +   May I be safe.\n2.  Loving Kindness Toward Someone You Love\n    *   Change your mantra to the second person and address your loved one directly:\n        +   May you feel happy.\n        +   May you be at peace.\n        +   May you be safe.\n3.  Loving Kindness Toward Someone Neutral\n    *   Think of someone with whom you have a neutral relationship-perhaps a coworker or a shopkeeper you see often.\n    *   Repeat your mantra with these people in mind:\n        +   May you feel happy.\n        +   May you be at peace.\n        +   May you be safe.\n4.  Loving Kindness Toward a Challenging Relationship\n    *   Imagine someone with whom you have a negative or challenging relationship and address them with your loving-kindness mantra.\n5.  Loving Kindness Toward All Beings\n    *   Change your mantra to include yourself and everyone:\n        +   May we all feel happy.\n        +   May we all be at peace.\n        +   May we all be safe.\n\n### Integrating Metta Meditation Into Daily Life\n\nThe key to metta meditation is consistency and repetition. If you can make time for a sit-down meditation once or a few times a day or a few times a week, that's ideal; however, even if you only meditate occasionally, maybe once a week or even just when you are feeling particularly down on yourself, you can still reap the benefits of loving-kindness meditation.\n\n*   You can also actively practice metta meditation when you find yourself in certain situations, such as when you are having trouble with a coworker or a boss.\n*   Take a moment, when you can, to send compassion to yourself and to them in order to approach what might be a tense and fraught circumstance calmly and empathetically. This sets you up for both compassion for yourself when dealing with a difficult situation and compassion for the other people involved.\n\n### Challenges\n\nSometimes, difficult feelings like sadness, anger, or grief can come up during your metta meditation. That's OK. Try not to judge yourself when this happens. Feeling those feelings means you are getting in touch with your emotions, which is always good. This might sound contradictory but try to be compassionate with yourself for not having compassion with yourself.\n\n*   If you can, treat these feelings with respect-accept them, be patient with them, and show yourself kindness for feeling them.\n*   This is how you move forward in your loving-kindness meditation.\n*   You might find yourself getting stuck in any of the phases of your metta meditation. You might not be able to access kind and loving feelings for certain people just yet. That's OK, too.\n*   The point is to work up to being able to love yourself and others at every stage-work with yourself and be patient with yourself until you can get there with honesty and without judgment.\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n\n1.  How often do I need to practice metta meditation for it to work?\n    *   Consistency is important.\n    *   Aim for once a day or a few times a week.\n    *   And it doesn't need to be a long meditation either-fitting even a few minutes regularly into your schedule can be helpful.\n2.  What if I'm having trouble getting started?\n    *   If you're having trouble jumping right into your metta meditation, that's ok.\n    *   To start, pick a mantra that feels the most accessible to you and begin with focusing just on yourself.\n    *   Practice that mantra until it feels true to you (the old fake it til you make it ), and then you can expand into including others in your metta meditation practice. Acknowledging and forgiving yourself for negative thoughts and feelings is the first step.\n\n### Meet Our Review Board\n\nShare Feedback on This Article\n\nNote: This content has been paraphrased, reformatted, and reorganized to fit a standard article structure.

No matter what your schedule looks like. If you take some time to meditate every day, you'll find that you generally feel less stressed and more focused at work, school, or wherever.\n\nMeditation isn't a complex concept. At its core, it emphasizes the importance of attention and awareness. When you meditate, you're able to focus on your mind and let go of distractions. Meditation lets you take a much-needed break from the noise of the world and your own busy thoughts. This break can make you feel more relaxed and clear-headed as you go about your day.\n\nStudies show that meditation can help reduce stress, improve how well you focus, and make you more aware of your thoughts and feelings. It can also be good for your overall mental and emotional health.1\n\nFinding the Type of Meditation That Works for You\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are different ways to meditate, like focusing on your breath, paying attention to your thoughts, or even moving your body mindfully. Each method can help you find some calmness and clarity.\n\nIf you think that meditation isn't for you, maybe because of some preconceived notion you have of the practice, you may simply not have found the type that works for you. There's no single way to meditate that works for everyone. While a friend might successfully meditate by sitting in silence, listening to a meditation guide might work better for you.\n\nMeditation simply means to focus. Meditation is an umbrella term much like sports. There are many different types of sports, and they all help you get good at different things. There are also many kinds of meditation, and they help you train your brain in different ways, says Dorsey Standish, a mindfulness & brain health expert.\n\nThe goal is to explore different types of meditation and find one that fits your life and makes you feel at peace. So take a few deep breaths and prepare to learn about eight types of meditation, how they are practiced, and what benefits you stand to gain by finding the one for you.\n\n### Mindfulness Meditation\n\nBeing fully present in the moment helps you develop an appreciation for all that life offers, and mindfulness meditation can help you achieve this. It involves paying attention to your thoughts, feelings, and sensations without reproach or judgment. It encourages you to simply observe patterns in these aspects of your life without trying to change them.\n\nThe most common technique in mindfulness meditation is focusing on your breath. You sit in a comfortable position, close your eyes, and pay attention to how your breath moves in and out of your body. You gently bring your focus back to your breath when your mind wanders.\n\nFor Standish, one of her go-to practices for new mindfulness students is a 1-minute method to stop the stress cycle and calm the nervous system. It's called the S.T.O.P. technique. When you notice you're stressed or frantic, S.T.O.P. and take a mindful pause:\n\n*   Stop what you're doing\n*   Take a few deep breaths\n*   Observe your experience (thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations)\n*   Proceed with something that will support you in this moment\n\nOther techniques include body scan meditation, where you pay attention to different body parts and notice any sensations or feelings. You can also practice mindfulness during everyday activities like eating, walking, or even while doing chores by focusing entirely on the task, removing distractions, and paying rapt attention to your senses and emotions.\n\nIf you are living with chronic stress or anxiety, mindfulness meditation can be very beneficial for you. It helps you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings, making you less likely to get caught up in them. Mindfulness meditation is also helpful for improving your focus and concentration. At work, it can boost your productivity and creativity. In your personal life, it can improve your relationships and overall well-being.2\n\nBecause it's easy to practice and requires no special equipment, mindfulness meditation is great for beginners and can be done almost anywhere at any time.\n\n### Spiritual Meditation\n\nIf your spirituality is important to you, spiritual meditation can help you deepen your connection with a higher power you believe in. Even if you don't have religious or spiritual beliefs but are looking for a deeper sense of meaning and purpose in life, you can practice spiritual meditation.\n\nWhile other forms of meditation encourage you to focus on yourself, spiritual meditation wants you to look beyond yourself and connect with something greater.\n\nYou might use silent prayer, chants, or mantras in spiritual meditation. Many people choose a quiet place that feels special or sacred, like a church, temple, or a peaceful spot outdoors. The idea is to focus on your breath or a spiritual phrase and let go of your thoughts to feel a connection with a higher power or the universe.\n\nYou might use candles, incense, or prayer beads to make your practice feel more special or focused.\n\nSpiritual meditation can give you a deep sense of peace and connection to something larger than life. It's great for people who are looking to grow spiritually. This type of meditation can make you feel more compassionate and connected to the people around you. It can also feel comforting when you're stressed or sad because it tends to offer a sense of hope.\n\nPracticing spiritual meditation can help you align your life with your spiritual values or beliefs.\n\n### Focused Meditation\n\nEver find yourself lost in thought for several minutes, staring at one spot for too long? That's a great way to begin focused meditation. This type requires you to concentrate on a single object, sound, or thought. You could even focus on your breath, as with many other meditation styles It trains your mind to focus on one thing and ignore distractions.\n\nIf your mind wanders, don't fuss; gently bring it back to what you've chosen to concentrate on.\n\nTo practice focused meditation, pick something to concentrate on. It could be the",

If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.\n\nThese services offer convenient, empathetic support for couples of all kinds\n\nBy Hannah Owens, LMSW\nUpdated on May 15, 2025\n\n**Our Top Picks**\n\n*   Regain Online-Therapy.com Talkspace\n*   See More (2)\n*   Growing Self Modern Intimacy\n\n**What to Expect from Online Couples Counseling**\n\n*   How much does it cost?\n*   Counseling services can range from $75 to $450 per session or more. Some companies offer subscriptions for less than $500 per month.\n*   Who is it for? Couples, people in relationships, and individuals who want to work on their relationships independently.\n*   Will insurance cover it? Usually, couples therapy is not covered by insurance, but this also depends on the company and whether one of the people in couples therapy has a mental health diagnosis that is being treated.\n*   How do we meet? Many online couples therapy companies offer weekly sessions via video chat, phone, or text. In many cases, you and your partner can join the session from different devices.\n*   Is it confidential? Be sure to read through any company's privacy policy to better understand whether it is HIPAA-compliant (HIPAA is the law that protects personal health information) and whether it shares any private information with third parties; we recommend opting out of data collection.\n*   What's the time commitment? You and your partner might find that you can work out your issues in a number of weeks, while other couples might need months or even years in therapy. As for how long you'll spend in each session, the companies on this list offer sessions from 30 to 50 minutes each.\n*   Does it work? Couples therapy, even online couples therapy in particular, has been proven effective, but you'll only get out what you put in. If you come to therapy ready to do the work, you're more likely to see success.\n\n**How I Review Online Therapy Services**\n\nI've spent three years testing and surveying real therapy users and reviewing their experiences to help rate and share the best online therapy services. You can see a full breakdown of our online therapy research and testing process on Verywell Mind, but here is an overview of how I capture and evaluate firsthand experience and survey data.\n\n*   Firsthand Experience\n    *   I had 65 different people sign up for talk therapy with all 55 online therapy companies reviewed.\n    *   Over the past three years, I've published 153 reviews (here are our reviews for BetterHelp and Talkspace, for instance).\n    *   I had my testers try out each company's therapy services, and if the company offered other services (like couples therapy and kid or teen therapy) we tested those too.\n    *   I asked each tester to try each service for at least a month, which usually meant between two and six sessions at each company.\n    *   I also asked testers to switch therapists partway through, if possible, in order to get a holistic idea of the offerings and quality of each company.\n    *   My testers were located all across the United States and abroad, meaning I gained extensive information about each company's services in a variety of areas.\n*   User Surveys\n    *   I surveyed more than 8,000 therapy clients who are currently using one of the 55 online therapy companies tested or who had used one in the recent past.\n    *   I collected 350 different data points in which I asked users to evaluate each company's services, from their therapist's qualifications to whether they found a therapist who met all their needs to how they'd rate the company overall.\n\n**How Do You Know If You Need Couples Therapy?**\n\n*   If you are having trouble communicating with your partner, if you find yourselves fighting a lot, or if you are disagreeing about important aspects of your lives, these are all great reasons to try out couples therapy.\n*   Working with a couples therapist can help strengthen your relationship by improving the way you talk to and interact with each other, practicing better ways of solving problems, and really delving into the issues that are repeatedly arising in the relationship.\n\n**Paying for Online Couples Therapy**\n\nSome online therapy companies who provide couples therapy operate as subscriptions-you pay a certain amount monthly for a certain number of sessions in that month. Other companies are pay-per-session. The amount you pay might be fixed, or might differ depending on your location or the qualifications of your therapist. It's important to note that couples therapy is generally not covered by insurance, because it is usually not considered a necessary service. However, if one or both of you have a diagnosed mental health condition, you might be able to use your insurance to pay for your online couples therapy sessions.\n\n**Why Trust Verywell Mind**\n\nHannah Owens is Verywell Mind's Mental Health Editor.

By John Loeppky Updated on August 29, 2024\n\nMedically reviewed by Shaheen Lakhan, MD, PhD, FAAN Verywell Mind Getty Images\n\n**The History of Binaural Beats and How They Work**\n\nBinaural beats were first identified by Heinrich Wilhelm Dove, a meteorologist who primarily focused on weather and climate, in the mid-19th century. More than 100 years later, Dr. Gerald Oster published the first scientific paper on the subject in 1973. They involve what experts like Brian Taylor, AuD, senior director of audiology for Signia and an adjunct professor at the University of Wisconsin call an auditory illusion.\n\nWhen you present one tone to one ear and a second to the other ear, your brain perceives an additional tone, says Taylor. This is the essence of binaural beats, an auditory illusion in which each ear is transmitting one frequency to the central auditory pathway. The thinking and accompanying research argue that different frequencies, measured in hertz, are more applicable to different applications.\n\n**When to Use Binaural Beats**\n\nA lot of the public narratives about binaural beats, including those we see on social media, look to apply the process to particular situations, particularly where some type of re-regulation might be useful. Some common use cases include focusing while studying, reducing anxiety or stress, and improving a person's sleep.\n\n**How to Use Binaural Beats**\n\nBinaural beats have traditionally been split into two broad use cases:\n\n*   As a form of therapy to induce calmness or mindfulness, focus, or sleep\n*   As a so-called digital drug to induce a state of euphoria similar to what can be available via psychoactive drugs\n\n**Are There Benefits for Mental Health?**\n\nWe keep coming back to this hiccup with regards to effectiveness. Researchers in a 2023 systematic review wrote that part of the issue is how different studies have applied various methodologies.\n\n**Are Binaural Beats Safe?**\n\nBinaural beats are generally considered safe. However, those who choose to use them are urged-especially if they have a brain-based disability such as epilepsy-to check in with their primary care physician before use.\n\nYou are also urged, just like when you're listening to your favorite pop-punk band, not to listen too loudly and to stop listening if doing so is creating the opposite effect. The world is depressing enough, you don't need to add to it with your playlist.\n\n**Where Can I Find Resources on Binaural Beats?**\n\nGiven the mixed bag of results that researchers have discovered when diving deeper into binaural beats, it's important to proceed with caution. There are multiple playlists on YouTube for binaural beats, though mileage may vary. There are also multiple phone apps on your app store of choice that can provide you access to binaural beats.\n\nTaylor says that this proliferation of digital options has helped binaural beats become a bit more mainstream. With the ubiquity of smartphones, apps and earbuds, everyone has access to trying binaural beats...Remember to get the full effects you need to listen with earbuds.\n\nThis has some inherent limitations. That said, maybe worth a try to enhance concentration, reduce stress, fall asleep, or improve creativity. McCarthy says the most common way her clients are finding binaural beats is via social media platforms like TikTok.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nIt seems as if the worst case scenario, if you listen to binaural beats at a reasonable volume level, is that nothing will happen. It's valuable to keep an eye on the ongoing research into this tool's effectiveness-but if it's helping you, great! If audio stimuli helps you regulate, then it may also be worth looking into strategies such as music therapy. Or, you can return to your favorite playlists.\n\nThose never seem to let us down.

When you feel yourself caught in the grip of fear or anxiety, focusing your sensations in the present moment can help you get out of those distressing thoughts and feelings.\n\nGrounding techniques are often used as a way of coping with flashbacks or dissociation when you have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).1 They can also be helpful in other types of anxiety. Because it focuses on being present in the moment, grounding can be considered a variant of mindfulness.\n\n**Grounding Techniques**\n\nTo connect with the here and now, do something (or several things) that will bring all your attention to the present moment. Be sure to keep your eyes open while you're grounding yourself so you're aware of everything that's going on around you. If you notice that you're slipping into a flashback or a dissociative state, try some of these grounding techniques.\n\n*   **Sight**\n    *   Complete a crossword puzzle, sudoku, word search, or other puzzle.\n    *   Count all the pieces of furniture around you.\n    *   Play a distracting game on your tablet, computer, or smartphone.\n    *   Put on your favorite movie or TV show.\n    *   Read a book or magazine.\n    *   Take a mental inventory of everything around you, such as all the colors and patterns you see, the sounds you hear, and the scents you smell.

If these particular grounding techniques don't work for you, try something else. For example, some people find that a rubber band on their wrist is useful for snapping them back to the moment. The ultimate goal is to live in the now and focus on the present when the past starts coming up.2\n\n**When to Seek Professional Help**\n\nGround can be a helpful way to manage symptoms of anxiety, dissociation, and flashbacks. If the symptoms you are experiencing are causing distress or interfering with your life, it's important to talk to a mental health professional.\n\nThe specific treatment your doctor or therapist recommends will depend on your diagnosis. PTSD Treatments Your doctor may prescribe medications, including antidepressants or antipsychotics, to help manage your symptoms. Different types of psychotherapy, including cognitive processing therapy, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy, and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) can be helpful.\n\nAnxiety Treatments Anxiety is also typically treated with therapy and medication. Medications that may be prescribed for anxiety include antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and beta blockers. CBT and exposure therapy can be highly effective.7\n\n**Helpful Resources**\n\nIf you aren't getting treatment for your PTSD but would like to, you can find PTSD treatment providers in your area through the Anxiety Disorder Association of America website.\n\nThe International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (ISSTD) also provides a wealth of information on the connection between trauma and dissociation, how to cope with dissociation, and links to therapists who treat trauma and dissociation. How PTSD Is Treated Takeaways Grounding techniques can be extremely helpful for those moments when you feel yourself getting caught up in your own head.\n\nIt can be as simple as paying attention to the world around you or engaging your senses to help distract you from anxious, fearful feelings. This can be particularly helpful if you have a condition such as PTSD or anxiety.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember these techniques aren't a substitute for treatment. If you are struggling with anxiety or symptoms of PTSD, be sure to talk to your doctor to learn more about treatments that can help.\n\n9 Healthy Coping Skills for PTSD Read More: CONDITIONS A-Z PTSD LIVING WITH 7 Sources By Matthew Tull, PhD Matthew Tull, PhD is a professor of psychology at the University of Toledo, specializing in post-traumatic stress disorder.
