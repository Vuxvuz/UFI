Retrieved from [www.nytimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com)\n \n**So, Do You *Actually* Like Them or Is It the Romantic Fantasy Talking?**\n\nWhen you meet someone new, it's hard not to feel completely enamored by their presence and the prospect of a new romance. Especially if they're super attractive, schmoozing you in all the right ways, and have no upfront red flags. But are you really feeling them or just the idea of them (and the possible happily ever after you two could have)? Let's find out.\n\n**The Importance of Understanding Your Feelings**\n\nFirst step: identify your feelings. Look, we've all felt the instant giddiness and excitement over getting to know someone new. But take a step back-stop romanticizing!-and identify your feelings. Understanding how you feel is helpful in any context but is especially crucial in romantic relationships.\n\n*   A relationship in which we are content will improve our sense of self-esteem, perhaps improving quality of life, job performance, and achievement of goals.\n*   Having clarity on your feelings is kind of cool and empowering. It allows you to believe in yourself and make confident decisions.\n\n**What Does It Mean to Really Like Someone?**\n\nCrushes are a dime a dozen. There's that sweet barista at the local coffee shop, the cutie you've been on a few dates with already, the coworker who always makes you blush. But do you like any of them-or the image of them in your head? It's tricky to tell the difference because practically every budding relationship starts with some level of infatuation and (perhaps naive) adoration.\n\n*   In fact, studies go so far as to say that initial euphoric feelings are akin to the high you'd experience taking a drug like cocaine.\n*   But that attraction only goes so far, especially once you begin asking yourself the important questions.\n\n**The Role of Loneliness in Finding Love**\n\nDating is hard, okay? It's not for the weak! The loneliness you feel when a situationship falls apart or your crush is no longer interested...like, we've all been there before. And while loneliness is not inherently negative, it can make us delusional in romantic relationships.\n\n*   We often struggle with separating loneliness from deeper emotions such as rejection, abandonment, shame, or worthlessness-what I refer to as the four horsemen of childhood trauma.\n*   When my clients are struggling with loneliness, particularly after a breakup, they realize this feeling is a normal response to the situation. At other times, loneliness is heavier when connected to a childhood trigger.\n\n**What to Do If You're Still Unsure**\n\nOprah once famously said, I don't know means no. AKA, if you're feeling eh about them, chances are you're not interested. If you're not sure if you're into someone, you're probably not, Holz says.\n\n*   Perhaps a cognitive part of you likes some of their qualities on paper, but you're not attracted to them or excited by them when you're together.\n*   Being uncertain doesn't mean you need to break off ties or plunge deeper into the relationship-there's no rush to the finish line here. Keep exploring, but give yourself a date-say, two weeks or a month-to sift through your feelings.\n\n**Signs You Like Someone**\n\nThey make you feel good\nYou want to keep learning about them\nYou can be your authentic self around them\nYou make time for them\nYou find joy in doing nice things for them\nYou feel energized versus drained by them\nYou have shared interests\nYour values are aligned\nYou remember small details about them\nYou may feel a little nervous in their presence (in the early stages)\nYou may feel like you're with someone you've known forever\nYou share similar goals\nYou feel safe and respected\nYou think about them even when they're gone\nYou're endeared by even their odd traits\n\n**Signs You Just Like the Idea of Them**\n\nYou only want to spend time with them when you're bored or lonely\nYou find them physically attractive but aren't quite sure about their personality\nYou feel drained after spending time with them\nYou are fixated more on whether they like you versus you liking each other\nYour feelings fluctuate depending on your mood\nYou're hyped on their potential (or an idealized version of them) versus who they really are\nYour interest in them is driven by how they make you look to others\nYou don't feel a strong emotional connection\nYou don't have shared values\nOutside pressures are making it feel like you need to stay together\nYou don't share similar life goals\nThere's no spark\nThe relationship feels stagnant\nYou don't really see a long-term future with this person\n\n**What We Can Learn from This**\n\nDating is hard, okay? It's not for the weak! The loneliness you feel when a situationship falls apart or your crush is no longer interested...like, we've all been there before. And while loneliness is not inherently negative, it can make us delusional in romantic relationships.\n\n*   We often struggle with separating loneliness from deeper emotions such as rejection, abandonment, shame, or worthlessness-what I refer to as the four horsemen of childhood trauma.\n*   When my clients are struggling with loneliness, particularly after a breakup, they realize this feeling is a normal response to the situation. At other times, loneliness is heavier when connected to a childhood trigger.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nOprah once famously said, I don't know means no. AKA, if you're feeling eh about them, chances are you're not interested. If you're not sure if you're into someone, you're probably not, Holz says.\n\n*   Perhaps a cognitive part of you likes some of their qualities on paper, but you're not attracted to them or excited by them when you're together.\n*   Being uncertain doesn't mean you need to break off ties or plunge deeper into the relationship-there's no rush to the finish line here. Keep exploring, but give yourself a date-say, two weeks or a month-to sift through your feelings. If things still feel uncertain, that's your sign to move on and find your perfect match. 1 \"The Effects of Oxytocin, Vasopressin, and Dopamine on Romantic Love: A Systematic Review.\" Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016) 2 \"Love is Not a Strategy for Solving Loneliness\" The New York Times.

Take This Quiz to Find Out**\n\nSee which friend profile matches you best\n\nBy Sanjana Gupta\nPublished on June 28, 2024\n\nAnchiy E+ Getty Images\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Friendship Quiz\nWho Is This Quiz For?\nThe Different Types of Friends\nWhy It's Important to Know What Kind of Friend You Are\n\nHave you ever wondered what kind of friend you are in your circle? We all play different roles in our relationships with others and sometimes it's fun to think about how our friends see us. Understanding your role as a friend profoundly influences the dynamics of your friendships, says Ashley Peña, LCSW, National Executive Director of Outpatient Services at AMFM Healthcare. That's why we've created this free quiz-take it to find out what kind of friend you are.\n\n**The Friendship Quiz**\n\nThis friendship quiz can help you figure out the type of friend you are. If more than one answer resonates with you, that's perfectly fine-just select the answer that reflects the most likely scenario.\n\n**Who Is This Quiz For?**\n\nEver wondered why your friends keep you around? This quiz can help you understand your strengths as a friend. If you're doing some self-reflection around your relationships, it can help you understand your role in your friends' lives. In fact, research shows us that being more self-aware can help improve the quality of our relationships.1 Understanding your role as a friend profoundly influences the dynamics of your friendships.\n\n- ASHLEY PEÑA, LCSW\n\n**The Different Types of Friends**\n\nThese are some of the different types of friendship roles that you might play:\n\n*   The planner: Corralling a big group can be complicated. With a mix of personalities, interests, and tastes, it's never easy to get everyone in the same place at the same time for a gathering that everyone will enjoy.\n*   The supportive listener: In any group of friends, it's inevitable that there will be difficult times at one point or another. From heartbreak to turmoil in the group and everything in between, there is a constant need for that friend with an empathetic nature to help navigate all the ups and down of life.\n*   The comic relief: Every group has a goofball-the friend who is always ready with a joke or a funny memory to lighten the mood. In good times and bad, this friend can always be relied on to put a smile on everyone's face.\n*   The life of the party: A strong group of friends will often be able to keep each other energized and have fun even when you're just staying in for the night. But sometimes we could use a little extra push from the extrovert in the group who is always working to make sure everyone is having fun.\n\n**Why It's Important to Know What Kind of Friend You Are**\n\nUnderstanding what kind of friend you are can be helpful in several ways:\n\n*   Strengthens your friendships: By reflecting on your strengths and weaknesses as a friend, you can identify areas where you can improve the way you connect with your friends.\n*   Helps you form new connections: Knowing your personality, communication style, and what you value in friendships can help you seek out people who are on your wavelength. In fact, research shows us that people with similar personalities tend to get along better as friends,2 so being more aware of your personality can help you connect with like-minded people.\n*   Improves self-awareness: Understanding how you show up in friendships can reveal aspects of your personality you might not have noticed before. This self-awareness can benefit all areas of your life, not just friendships.\n*   Boosts confidence: Knowing your strengths as a friend can be a confidence booster because it allows you to recognize the value you bring to friendships. Friendship, like any relationship, requires mutual effort and understanding between people. Being aware of how you contribute strengthens the bond and fosters openness and connection.\n\n- ASHLEY PEÑA, LCSW\n\n6 Benefits of Friendship and Why It's So Important to Stay Close Read More: LIVING WELL RELATIONSHIPS 2 Sources\n\nBy Sanjana Gupta\nSanjana is a health writer and editor.

They allow us to realize what's most important to us, from the people we care about to the opinions we hold, and force us to navigate the complexities of everyday life.\n\n**The 6 Types of Basic Emotions and Their Effect on Human Behavior**\n\nEmotions are influenced by a network of interconnected structures in the brain that make up what is known as the limbic system. Key structures including the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the limbic cortex play a pivotal role in emotions and behavioral responses.\n\n**Emotions and Types of Emotional Responses**\n\n*   Emotions can manifest in various ways, such as physical sensations, thoughts, and behaviors.\n*   They can be triggered by internal factors, like our thoughts and memories, or external stimuli, like people, events, or environments.\n\n**The Important Role of Emotions**\n\nEmotions play a vital role in our lives, serving as signals that help us navigate the world around us. They provide us with valuable information about ourselves and others, enabling us to form connections, build relationships, and achieve our goals.\n\n**Healthy Coping Skills for Uncomfortable Emotions**\n\nDeveloping healthy coping skills is essential when dealing with uncomfortable emotions. This can include practices like mindfulness, deep breathing, exercise, or creative expression. By learning to manage our emotions in a constructive way, we can reduce stress, improve our overall well-being, and cultivate emotional resilience.\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n*   How many emotions are there?\n    *   While it was previously identified that there are six basic emotions-happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger, and surprise-that are universally experienced in all human cultures, researchers have now found that there are 27 different categories of emotions.\n*   Can we control our emotions?\n    *   As human beings, we have the ability to self-regulate, or manage our thoughts, behaviors, and emotions-allowing us to better handle stress, deal with conflict, and accomplish our goals.\n\n**Key Terms**\n\n*   **Emotional Intelligence**: refers to the ability to perceive, control, and evaluate emotions.\n*   **Emotion Wheel**: an emotion classification system introduced by psychologist Robert Plutchik in the 1980s. The model allowed us to label our feelings, so we can develop our emotional literacy skills to have a greater awareness of ourselves and the emotions of others.\n*   **Expression**: is the act of communicating our thoughts and emotions with others, verbally or non-verbally.\n*   **Mood**: can be defined as a relatively stable affective state that is often described as positive or negative. Unlike emotions, which tend to be stronger and more specific, moods are more general and less intense.\n\n**Explore Understanding Emotions**\n\n1.  Is Everyone Looking At My Skin?

Dealbreakers in friendship don't often start off as dealbreakers, she began.\n\nShe explained that it usually starts as one friend making the occasional concession-covering the dinner tab, being the first to apologize, or generally deferring to the other person's wants. Yet, over time, when the first friend is always the one making compromises or giving a little more, this creates a pattern that can erode friendships.\n\nThe friendship cracks become hard to ignore. You have a conversation with your friend about your concerns and issues arise, she continued. These common include when a friend refuses to see the issue at hand, dismisses it, or (gasp) says you're being too sensitive. This type of response indicates a deep indifference to your feelings.\n\nWhile, in my case, my feelings weren't flat-out denied, I also felt they weren't taken seriously, evidenced by my friend's spotty communication. Plus, Blake brings up a good point. If a friend does not care about the relational dynamics that make up your friendship, that is going to be a very lonely friendship to be in and one that I'd offer is not healthy to stay in, she concluded.\n\nBlankenbecler is a friendship educator, so I was eager to hear how she believes friendship fallouts could be avoided. Her answer provided insight into the power of honesty. Based on some past friendship trauma, I believed that my friends really didn't care or even notice when I'd go dark for a few weeks if I was busy, she says.\n\nIf a friend does not care about the relational dynamics that make up your friendship, that is going to be a very lonely friendship to be in and one that I'd offer is not healthy to stay in. - BLAKE BLANKENBECLER, THERAPIST AND FRIENDSHIP EDUCATOR\n\nIt wasn't until a friend let her know how her going dark impacted them, leading her to create stories in her mind about why Blake was being distant. Not only did this help Blake realize the importance of communication, especially during busy times, but it also let her know that their friendship does really matter and her friends do notice and care when she is less available.\n\nCreating a culture in your friendships that values kind honesty and generosity is incredibly important for the sustainability of a friendship, she concluded.\n\n**It's Those Behaviors That Make You Feel Unsafe**\n\nNatalie Moore, a licensed therapist in California, identifies a friendship deal breaker as anything that makes you feel unsafe or uncomfortable in the relationship. Think along the lines of deception, betrayal, disrespect, or a lack of consistent support.\n\nWhen I asked her for examples of how these friendship deal breakers can show up in common situations, she named a few I think many of us can relate to. Your friend sharing your personal secrets with someone else, speaking badly about you behind your back... breaking promises, and overstepping your boundaries can all be possible dealbreakers, she shared.\n\nEven her listing off those examples made me think back to friendships I have had throughout my life, especially when younger, and how painful some of those experiences were. Your friend sharing your personal secrets with someone else, speaking badly about you behind your back... breaking promises, and overstepping your boundaries can all be possible dealbreakers - NATALIE MOORE, LMFT\n\nWhen it comes to addressing friendship deal breakers, Moore recommends following a simple formula-state what they did that bothered them, name what you would like them to do instead, and share how you believe their changes will improve the relationship.\n\nFriendships can be mended if you get a genuine sense that your friend is invested in the relationship and willing to make the changes you've asked them to make. But, she cautions, if your friend did something unforgivable that makes you question their values or judgment, it may be grounds to end the friendship for your own self-protection.\n\n**When They Just Don't Keep Their Word**\n\nResha Altai, a psychotherapist based in Los Angeles, California, feels a friendship deal breaker is when a boundary is broken. A very common example is loaning a friend money with an agreement that they will pay you back by a certain date, only to have that date come and go without communication, she explained.\n\nShe continued by expressing how this can be especially troublesome if integrity is a major value of yours-which it likely is for many people. However, she agrees with my initial take that conflict can't always be avoided. Rupture and repair is a natural part of any relationship, she shared.\n\nIt is all about being upfront and transparent about your boundaries, needs, and values to avoid friendship fallouts. Can A Friendship Be Mended Post Dealbreaker?\n\nCan a friendship be mended after a dealbreaker has occurred? It certainly can be, but there are some considerations to keep in mind. Has your friend acknowledged the dealbreaker? Has a sincere apology and changed behavior occurred? Resha encourages folks to ask themselves.\n\nIf the answer to both is yes, then there's great evidence that things could be mended. If not, she recommends taking a hard look at if this is the relationship for you or not. Blake abides by the old adage that time heals. Time can often be a great softener, she explained.\n\nShe noted that having time apart to think about your parts in the unhealthy friendship dynamics can allow the two of you to come back together with a deeper sense of empathy. But, don't expect things to immediately bounce back to how they were. Folks don't always make room for how hard it can be to mend a relationship.\n\nIt is true, sometimes we can breeze past the fact that fights and fallouts in relationships of all sorts are big deals. But, Blake stands by the idea of hanging in there and working through all the tender and awkward stages that come with mending a friendship.\n\nAnd, in the event things can't be mended? She encourages you to allow yourself space to grieve.\n\n**What Boundaries Actually Mean**\n\nIn Natalie's practice, she provides a lot of meaningful wisdom into the power",

The next, he's barely responsive.\n*   Fear of commitment: Your partner might avoid labels, shy away from long-term plans, or seem reluctant to define the relationship.\n*   Lack of vulnerability: It can sometimes feel like your partner is physically present but emotionally distant.\n*   Distractions: When things start getting too real, he might steer things back to flirting or joking around.\n*   Emotional avoidance: Your partner may not just struggle with feeling the extent of their own emotions without shutting down or denying them.\n\n**Signs an Emotionally Unavailable Man Is in Love with You**\n\n1.  He starts to open up\n2.  He makes time for you\n3.  He remembers the little things\n4.  He's protective of you\n5.  He lets you into his private world\n6.  He compliments you\n7.  He shares his vulnerabilities\n8.  He's willing to work on communication\n9.  He apologizes and makes things right\n10. He hints at the future\n\n**Why It's Important to Recognize the Signs**\n\n*   Gives you clarity: When you're with someone who struggles to show their emotions, it's easy to feel insecure or confused about where you stand.\n*   Strengthens your bond: By recognizing these signs, you start to see the efforts he's making to let you in, no matter how small they may be.\n*   Sets expectations: Knowing he's in love with you, even if he doesn't express it traditionally, can help you approach the relationship with realistic expectations.\n\n**How to Respond**\n\n1.  Appreciate his efforts, no matter how small\n2.  Communicate your needs gently\n3.  Show vulnerability\n4.  Be patient-but don't wait forever\n5.  Be prepared to walk away\n\n**Takeaways**\n\nNavigating a relationship with an emotionally unavailable man can feel like piecing together a puzzle, one hint at a time. While he might not express his feelings in the ways you're used to, love can still shine through in the small, significant ways he shows up for you. By recognizing the signs, you may get a glimpse of his true feelings, even if he's not ready to say the words out loud. However, it's essential to remember that healthy relationships require open communication and emotional intimacy. If you find yourself in a relationship where your needs aren't being met, prioritize your own well-being and consider whether the person is really the one for you. 1\\. Research shows that women care more about the emotional aspects of a relationship than the physical, and may be more likely to break up with a partner who is emotionally unavailable.2\\. Suppressing your emotions can make you unhappy.3\\. Be prepared to walk away from the relationship if it's not meeting your needs. \n\n1\\. Pay closer attention to signs that indicate he cares about you deeply, such as making time for you and remembering the little things.\n\n2\\. Communicate your needs gently and avoid pushing him to express himself in ways that feel unnatural to him.\n\n3\\. Show vulnerability by opening up about your own experiences and fears.\n\n4\\. Be patient but don't wait forever; give him a chance to grow, but keep an eye on your own well-being. 5\\. Repeatedly suppressing your emotions can make you unhappy.6\\. If he remains unwilling or unable to address the issue, it may be necessary to establish boundaries to protect yourself, such as limiting your emotional investment or walking away from the relationship.\n\n**Related Articles**\n\n*   LIVING WELL RELATIONSHIPS: Should You Pay Closer Attention to Beige Flags in a Relationship?\n*   30 Questions to Encourage Vulnerability in a Relationship, According to a Therapist\n\n**About the Author**\n\nSanjana Gupta is a health writer and editor.

Think of those movie scenes where two people lock eyes across a dance floor, and they're immediately drawn to each other.\n\n1\\. Benefits of Spontaneous Sexual Desire Style\n   *   A strong connection to your body.\n   *   You know immediately when you're turned on, which can feel energizing, flirty, and unpredictable.\n\n2\\. Challenges of Spontaneous Sexual Desire Style\n   *   When your partner isn't on the same page with you sexually, abruptly pumping the brakes and leaving you both confused.\n   *   Slowing your desire down can lead to misunderstandings and a sense of rejection that your partner isn't there yet.\n\n**Responsive Sexual Desire Style**\n\nResponsive sexual desire is the type of attraction that kicks in once intimacy unfolds. Physical intimacy and foreplay are needed to turn on the desire.\n\n1\\. Benefits of Responsive Sexual Desire Style\n   *   The pace is slower, but the build-up can be delicious as you use kissing, foreplay, and whatever gets you hot to transition into sex.\n   *   A person has no biological urge or sexual thoughts or fantasies, but something happened that caused them to at least consider the possibility of having sex.\n\n2\\. Challenges of Responsive Sexual Desire Style\n   *   When a partner looks for ardent enthusiasm and misinterprets a lack of initiation as a lack of attraction.\n   *   This can mistakenly create feelings of insecurity, confusion, and frustration, as the anticipation may become a barrier rather than an exciting part of the experience.\n\n**Context-Dependent Sexual Style**\n\nSome people predominantly identify with one type, others blend both styles together. Personally, I identify with a context-dependent sexual desire-I oscillate between both styles.\n\n1\\. Benefits of Context-Dependent Sexual Style\n   *   A flexible approach to the bedroom.\n   *   Since you can toggle between both styles, there's potential for varied sexual experiences based on your mood, how you're feeling in the relationship, and the environment you're in.\n\n2\\. Challenges of Context-Dependent Sexual Style\n   *   The inconsistency may prove to be a challenge, where certain conditions change how you respond to sex.\n   *   Arousal can fluctuate and subsequently, impact cues of desire on any given day.\n\n**How to Embrace Your Sexual Desire Style**\n\n*   Being mindfully present is one way to enhance this sexual desire style. As you relax and connect with your breath, you are engaged with your body and may feel more primed to embrace a spontaneous sexual desire.\n*   Focusing on your partner's emotional state helps too. Are they open to intimacy tonight-and if so, what do they need to get into the mood?\n*   Setting the right ambiance can prime you and your partner for intimacy. Try This That can look like cuddling in a cozy room with dim lighting, and your favorite TV show on.\n*   Similarly to the responsive sexual style, playful, non-sexual touch without the expectation of sex can help you get more in the mood.\n\n**Biology and Psychological Factors Affect Your Sexual Desire Style**\n\nYour sexual desire-and your desire style-is impacted by many factors. Javaid emphasizes that the hormones in our biology,2 along with social influences like our upbringing, media exposure, religion, and friends, all play a big role in shaping how we view sexuality.\n\n1\\. Biological Factors\n   *   The hormones in our biology.\n   *   On top of that, psychological factors like mental health, the quality of our relationships, and our self-esteem are also important.\n\n2\\. Psychological Factors\n   *   Mental health.\n   *   The quality of our relationships.\n   *   Our self-esteem.\n\n**How to Embrace and Communicate Your Sexual Desire Style**\n\nThere is no right or wrong way to experience desire. Knowing which style your body likes helps reduce internal and external conflict. You know what gets you off and you can now confidently express that without judgment or shame. Everyone has a different relationship to sex. Embrace what's best for you.\n\n1\\. Communicate Your Needs\n   *   Open communication is always crucial, and being gentle with oneself while shifting one's understanding is a good idea.\n   *   If a person is still struggling or having difficulty understanding what is happening, they may want to seek out professional help from a sex therapist. Expert-Vetted: Our Picks for the Best Online Sex Therapy Services of 2024\n\n2\\. Keep In Mind\n   *   Understanding your unique sexual desire style leads to deeper self-awareness and satisfaction.\n   *   By openly sharing your needs with your partner, you forge an intimate bond that honors both your authentic desires. Exploring these dynamics becomes a powerful step toward a fulfilling and vibrant sexual relationship.\n\n3\\.

The Biology and Psychology of Addiction: New Insights and Therapeutic Strategies for the Treatment of Substance Use Disorders, 2022. *   **Addiction** is a complex disorder characterized by compulsive use of substances or activities that trigger our reward systems despite experiencing adverse consequences.\n*   A person's genes and environment influence this condition.\n\n**Understanding Addiction**\n\nAddiction is widely viewed as a brain disease due to how it impacts the brain's reward, pleasure, and self-control circuits.\n\n*   In the past, addiction was thought to only encompass substance abuse, but the definition has been expanded to include activities like gambling, gaming, shopping, and exercise.\n*   It's also important to note that addiction is about the underlying neurology of the brain and not about the outward behaviors.\n\n**Causes of Addiction**\n\nPeople engage in potentially addictive activities to feel pleasure, and over time, the reinforcing effect of these activities may change brain chemistry to create an unconscious drive to continue the behavior.\n\n*   Multiple factors influence this process, including genetics, diet, mental health, past traumas, pain, stress, and stage of life.\n*   Genetics account for about half of a person's risk for developing an addiction.\n\n**Breaking an Addiction**\n\nThe first step in overcoming addiction is to desire change and avoid the people, places, and things that promote the addiction.\n\n*   Support groups, mentors, and 12-step programs provide help while counselors, recovery centers, and physicians provide expertise and medication to treat cravings and the effects of withdrawal.\n*   Eating healthy and getting exercise also play an important role in recovery.\n\n**Key Terms**\n\n*   **Substance Use Disorder**: a psychiatric condition that involves the compulsion to use a drug or alcohol despite the development of adverse consequences.\n*   **Behavioral Addiction**: occurs when a pleasurable activity changes the brain and drives a person to engage compulsively in the activity despite harmful consequences.\n*   **Intervention**: an organized attempt by family members or friends to confront a loved one about how their addictive behavior has affected them.\n*   **Comorbidity**: refers to the presence of more than one distinct condition in an individual. 2., 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1, 7.1, 8.1, 9.1, 10.1, 11.1, 12.1, 13.1, 14.1, 15.1, 16.1, 17.1, 18.1, 19.1, 20.1, 21.1, 22.1, 23.1, 24., 25., 26., 27., 28., 29.1, 30., 31., 32.1, 33.1, 34.1, 35.1, 36.1, 37.1, 38.1, 39., 40.1, 41.1, 42.1, 43.1, 44.1, 45.1, 46.1, 47.1, 48., 49.1, 50., 51.1, 52.1, 53.1, 54.1, 55.1, 56.1, 57.1, 58.1, 59.1, 60., 61., 62.1, 63.1, 64.1, 65.1, 66.1, 67.1, 68.1, 69.1, 70., 71.1, 72.1, 73.1, 74.1, 75.1, 76.1, 77.1, 78.1, 79.1, 80., 81.1, 82.1, 83.1, 84.1, 85.1, 86.1, 87.1, 88., 89.1, 90., 91.1, 92., 93.1, 94., 95.1, 96.1, 97.1, 98.1, 99.1, 100.1, 101.1, 102.1, 103.1, 104.1, 105.1, 106.1, 107.1, 108.1, 109., 110.1, 111.1, 112.1, 113.1, 114.1, 115.1, 116.1, 117.1, 118.1, 119.1, 120., 121.1, 122.1, 123.1, 124.1, 125.1, 126.1, 127.1, 128.1, 129.1, 130., 131.1, 132.1, 133.1, 134.1, 135.1, 136.1, 137.1, 138.1, 139.1, 140., 141.1, 142.1, 143.1, 144.1, 145.1, 146.1, 147.1, 148.1, 149.1, 150.1, 151.1, 152.1, 153.1, 154.1, 155.1, 156.1, 157., 158.1, 159.1, 160., 161.1, 162.1, 163.1, 164.1, 165.1, 166.1, 167.1, 168.1, 169.1, 170., 171.1, 172.1, 173.1, 174.1, 175.1, 176.1, 177.1, 178.1, 179.1, 180., 181.1, 182.1, 183.1, 184.1, 185.1, 186.1, 187.1, 188.1, 189.1, 190., 191.1, 192.1, 193.1, 194.1, 195.1, 196.1, 197.1, 198.1, 199.1, 200., 201.1, 202.1, 203.1, 204.1, 205.1, 206.1, 207.1, 208.1, 209.1, 210., 211.1, 212.1, 213.1, 214.1, 215.1, 216.1, 217.1, 218.1, 219.1, 220., 221.1, 222.1, 223.1, 224.1",

The Best, Most Affordable Online Couples Therapy, According to a Therapist These services offer convenient, empathetic support for couples of all kinds\n\nBy Hannah Owens, LMSW Updated on May 15, 2025\n\n**Our Top Picks**\n\nRegain Online-Therapy.com Talkspace See More (2) Growing Self Modern Intimacy\n\n**What to Expect from Online Couples Counseling**\n\nHow much does it cost? Counseling services can range from $75 to $450 per session or more. Some companies offer subscriptions for less than $500 per month.\n\nWho is it for? Couples, people in relationships, and individuals who want to work on their relationships independently.\n\nWill insurance cover it? Usually, couples therapy is not covered by insurance, but this also depends on the company and whether one of the people in couples therapy has a mental health diagnosis that is being treated.\n\nHow do we meet? Many online couples therapy companies offer weekly sessions via video chat, phone, or text. In many cases, you and your partner can join the session from different devices.\n\nIs it confidential? Be sure to read through any company's privacy policy to better understand whether it is HIPAA-compliant (HIPAA is the law that protects personal health information) and whether it shares any private information with third parties; we recommend opting out of data collection.\n\nWhat's the time commitment? You and your partner might find that you can work out your issues in a number of weeks, while other couples might need months or even years in therapy. As for how long you'll spend in each session, the companies on this list offer sessions from 30 to 50 minutes each.\n\nDoes it work? Couples therapy, even online couples therapy in particular, has been proven effective, but you'll only get out what you put in. If you come to therapy ready to do the work, you're more likely to see success.\n\n**How I Review Online Therapy Services**\n\nI've spent three years testing and surveying real therapy users and reviewing their experiences to help rate and share the best online therapy services. You can see a full breakdown of our online therapy research and testing process on Verywell Mind, but here is an overview of how I capture and evaluate firsthand experience and survey data.\n\nFirsthand Experience\n\nI had 65 different people sign up for talk therapy with all 55 online therapy companies reviewed. Over the past three years, I've published 153 reviews (here are our reviews for BetterHelp and Talkspace, for instance). I had my testers try out each company's therapy services, and if the company offered other services (like couples therapy and kid or teen therapy) we tested those too.\n\nI asked each tester to try each service for at least a month, which usually meant between two and six sessions at each company. I also asked testers to switch therapists partway through, if possible, in order to get a holistic idea of the offerings and quality of each company. My testers were located all across the United States and abroad, meaning I gained extensive information about each company's services in a variety of areas.\n\nUser Surveys\n\nI surveyed more than 8,000 therapy clients who are currently using one of the 55 online therapy companies tested or who had used one in the recent past. I collected 350 different data points in which I asked users to evaluate each company's services, from their therapist's qualifications to whether they found a therapist who met all their needs to how they'd rate the company overall.\n\n**How Do You Know If You Need Couples Therapy?**\n\nIf you are having trouble communicating with your partner, if you find yourselves fighting a lot, or if you are disagreeing about important aspects of your lives, these are all great reasons to try out couples therapy. Working with a couples therapist can help strengthen your relationship by improving the way you talk to and interact with each other, practicing better ways of solving problems, and really delving into the issues that are repeatedly arising in the relationship.\n\nBut couples therapy isn't just for people whose relationships are on the rocks. Going to couples therapy can help even the strongest of couples understand each other better and get ahead of problems that might crop up down the road. It's a great way to practice good communication and make sure that you and your partner are doing-and will continue to do-the best things for your relationship.\n\n**Paying for Online Couples Therapy**\n\nSome online therapy companies who provide couples therapy operate as subscriptions-you pay a certain amount monthly for a certain number of sessions in that month. Other companies are pay-per-session. The amount you pay might be fixed, or might differ depending on your location or the qualifications of your therapist.\n\nIt's important to note that couples therapy is generally not covered by insurance, because it is usually not considered a necessary service. However, if one or both of you have a diagnosed mental health condition, you might be able to use your insurance to pay for your online couples therapy sessions.\n\n**Why Trust Verywell Mind**\n\nHannah Owens is Verywell Mind's Mental Health Editor.
