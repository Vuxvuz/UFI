Alcoholism, like other addictions, tends to run in families, and members of those families are at increased risk for developing alcoholism.\n\n*   A substance use disorder diagnosis can be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe depending on the number of diagnostic symptoms or criteria a person exhibits.\n*   Behavioral addiction occurs when a pleasurable activity changes the brain and drives a person to engage compulsively in the activity despite harmful consequences.\n\n**KEY TERMS**\n\n*   Substance Use Disorder: A psychiatric condition that involves the compulsion to use a drug or alcohol despite the development of adverse consequences.\n*   Behavioral Addiction: A disorder characterized by compulsive engagement in an activity despite experiencing adverse consequences.\n*   Intervention: An organized attempt by family members or friends to confront a loved one about how their addictive behavior has affected them.\n*   Comorbidity: The presence of more than one distinct condition in an individual.\n\n**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**\n\n1.

Mental Disorders: Definition, Prevalence, Causes, Diagnosis, Treatment, Coping Strategies, And More What Are Mental Disorders? A mental disorder is often used interchangeably with the terms psychological disorder, psychiatric disorder, or mental illness. The official term is mental disorder.\n\n**What are mental disorders?**\n\nMental disorders are defined as conditions that create distress and affect a person's ability to function. These conditions affect how people behave, think, and feel. They can also impact how people are able to function at home, at work, in school, in relationships, and in other important life domains.\n\n**Symptoms of Mental Disorders**\n\nSome of the symptoms that a person with a mental disorder might experience include:\n\n*   Anxiety\n*   Changes in appetite\n*   Changes in behavior\n*   Changes in mood\n*   Delusions, hallucinations, or other difficulties perceiving reality\n*   Depression or feelings of sadness\n*   Difficulty sleeping\n*   Drug or alcohol use\n*   Fatigue or low energy\n*   Irritability\n*   Loss of interest\n*   Social withdrawal or isolation\n*   Trouble concentrating\n*   Suicidal thoughts or self-harm\n\n**How Are Mental Disorders Diagnosed?**\n\nThe classification and diagnosis of mental disorders are important concerns for both mental health providers and mental health clients. While there is no single, definitive definition of mental disorders, some different classifications and diagnostic criteria have emerged.\n\nClinicians utilize the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association, to determine whether a set of symptoms or behaviors meets the criteria for diagnosis as a mental disorder. The International Classification of Diseases, published by the World Health Organization, is also frequently used.\n\n**Treatment for Mental Disorders**\n\nThe specific treatment for a mental disorder varies depending on the condition and the needs of the individual. Many mental health conditions are treated with psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of the two. Lifestyles changes and support groups can often be helpful as well.\n\n**Coping With a Mental Disorder**\n\nIn addition to getting professional treatment for a mental health condition, there are other strategies that can be helpful for finding relief. Lifestyle changes: For some mental health conditions, lifestyle changes can be helpful. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM): Other practices that may help people cope with symptoms of mental illness include CAM treatments.\n\n**Recap**\n\nMental disorders can create distress and make it difficult to function as you normally do. If you suspect you have a mental disorder, talk to a health care professional to learn more. With an appropriate diagnosis, you can better understand your symptoms and find the treatment you need so that you can find relief and improve your ability to function in your daily life.\n\n**References**\n\n1.

There are two types of behaviorism: methodological and radical. The former emphasizes the study of observable behavior, while the latter focuses on understanding behavior through reinforcement and punishment.\n\n**History**\n\nBehaviorism was formally established in 1913 with John B. Watson's paper \"Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It.\" Watson argued that all behaviors are the result of experience and can be trained through conditioning. He believed that any person could be trained to become a specific type or specialist, regardless of their background or talents.\n\n**Types**\n\nThere are two main types of behaviorism:\n\n*   **Methodological Behaviorism**: This approach emphasizes the study of observable behavior and excludes internal mental states.\n*   **Radical Behaviorism**: This approach focuses on understanding behavior through reinforcement and punishment.\n\n**Classical Conditioning**\n\nClassical conditioning is a technique used in behavioral training. It involves pairing a neutral stimulus with a naturally occurring stimulus, eventually leading to the association of the neutral stimulus with the response. The process works by developing an association between an environmental stimulus and a naturally occurring stimulus.\n\n**Operant Conditioning**\n\nOperant conditioning is a method of learning that occurs through reinforcement and punishment. Through operant conditioning, an association is made between a behavior and its consequences. This approach states that when a desirable result follows an action, the behavior is more likely to occur again in the future.\n\n**Uses for Behaviorism**\n\nBehaviorism has various applications, including education, research, and mental health. Its techniques can be used to help students learn, conduct research, and treat mental health conditions.\n\n**Impact of Behaviorism**\n\nBehaviorism has had a significant impact on our understanding of human psychology. The conditioning process alone has been used to understand many different types of behaviors, ranging from how people learn to how language develops.\n\n**Criticisms of Behaviorism**\n\nSome critics argue that behaviorism is a one-dimensional approach to understanding human behavior, neglecting internal influences such as moods, thoughts, and feelings. Others suggest that behavioral theories do not account for free will or the role of genetics in determining behavior.\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n*   Who founded behaviorism? John B. Watson.\n*   How is behaviorism used in education? Behaviorism can be used to help elicit positive behaviors or responses in students through reinforcement.\n*   What makes behaviorism different from psychoanalysis? Behaviorism focuses on environmental stimuli, while psychoanalysis emphasizes internal stimuli and the unconscious mind.",

    "content": "1. \"Chromotherapy.\" American Cancer Society, www.cancer.org/treatment/survivorship-care/planning/chromotherapy.html 2. \"Blue Light Exposure and Your Sleep\" by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/media/electronic-device-light-exposure/index.cfm#blue-lights 3. \"How color affects your mood.\" BBC, www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/z6w9nqf. Last medically reviewed on January 12, 2024 Medically reviewed by Steven Gans, MD Laura Porter Updated on May 26, 2018\n\n**Types**\n\nThere are different types of color therapy that include:\n\n1.\nRed: It is used to energize or invigorate a person who might be feeling tired or down. However, red may also trigger people who might already be tense.\n\n2.\nBlue: Chromatherapists use blue to try and influence depression and pain. Darker shades of blue are also thought to have sedative properties and may be tried for people who experience insomnia or other sleeping disorders.\n\n3.\nGreen: Green is the color of nature, and according to chromatherapists, it can help relieve stress and relax a person.\n\n4.\nYellow: Yellow can be used to improve your mood and make you more happy and optimistic.\n\n5.\nOrange: Orange, much like yellow, can be used to elicit happy emotions from people. The bright warm color is also thought to be able to stimulate appetite and mental activity.\n\n6.\nThe Color Blue: Meaning and Color Psychology\n\n**Techniques of Color Therapy**\n\nThere are two major techniques of color therapy:\n\n1.\nColor therapists believe that color can enter our bodies either through our eyes or skin. Each color we can see has its wavelength and unique frequency. Each unique frequency has a different effect on people and is used for different purposes.\n\n2.\nWarm colors are typically used for stimulating effects, while cool colors are used for calming effects.\n\n**Uses**\n\nChromotherapy is considered a type of alternative medicine treatment that has been purported to help with:\n\n*   Stress\n*   Depression\n*   Aggression\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Sleep disorders\n*   Anxiety\n*   Certain cancers\n*   Skin infections\n\n**Benefits**\n\nOver the decades, color therapy has been purported to provide several benefits ranging from physical to mental, including:\n\n*   Stress relief: Certain colors like blue and green are thought to have soothing effects on people who are stressed or anxious.\n*   Boost your appetite: Warm and stimulating colors are thought to boost your appetite when you struggle with having a desire for food.\n*   Seasonal affective disorder: People mainly suffer from seasonal affective disorder during colder weather because of the lack of sunlight. Certain types of bright light therapy have been shown to be of benefit for this mood disorder. Color therapy also suggests the unproven idea that warm colors like yellow and orange could also help with this.\n*   To boost your energy: Colors such as red and yellow are believed to boost your energy and make you more motivated.\n\n**Things to Consider**\n\nWhile the premise of color therapy is that certain colors elicit specific emotions from most people, this isn't always the case. Human beings are unique. The effects of certain colors on people may range from person to person. Colors most people might find calming or soothing might be anxiety-inducing or depressing to others.\n\n**How to Get Started**\n\nWhile the science behind color therapy is still largely unsubstantiated, it's completely harmless to practice certain aspects of color therapy on your own. Here are some ways you can get started with experimenting with color therapy:\n\n*   Get rid of blue lights at nighttime for better sleep.\n*   Bask in nature. The greens of leaves and grass we get in abundance in nature can positively relax us.\n*   Be intentional about color choices. When picking colors for anything, from the color of the walls in your room to the color of clothes you wear, choose colors that you find stimulating or elicit positive emotions.\n\nIt's important to reiterate that color therapy doesn't serve as a definitive treatment for any mental or physical health conditions. If you are experiencing a condition such as depression, it's important to speak to your doctor about it. 3 Sources By Toketemu Ohwovoriole Toketemu has been multimedia storyteller for the last four years.
