Follow us @recoverydaily on social media to stay up-to-date on our latest content, news, and releases.\n\n**How the Serenity Prayer Can Support Your Mental Health Journey**\n\n**What Is the Sererynity Prayer?**\n\nThe Serenity Prayer is a line of wisdom that has been around for decades, frequently mentioned in pop culture, faith-based practices, and mental health spaces. According to Leah Young, LCPC, Clinical Manager at Pathlight Mood & Anxiety Center, the Serenity Prayer is a way of challenging our emotional reaction, allowing us to empower ourselves over the things we have control over, and letting go of what we don't.\n\n**Components**\n\n*   **Serenity**: Accepting things just as they are can bring contentment with our circumstances.\n*   **Courage**: Change requires courage, especially when it comes with many question marks and unknowns.\n*   **Wisdom**: Knowing what can and cannot be controlled frees up energy for what can be changed.\n\n**Historical Background**\n\nThe Serenity Prayer was written in 1932 by American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr. It has been used in tandem with mental health treatments, especially once its popularity rose in the mid-1930s to 1940s. The prayer is widely adopted in 12-step programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous.\n\n**The Serenity Prayer**\n\nGod, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference. Living one day at a time, enjoying one moment at a time. Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace. Taking, as he did, the sinful world as it is, not as I would have it. Trusting that he will make all things right if I surrender to His will; that I may be reasonably happy in this life, and supremely happy with Him forever.\n\n**Applications Beyond 12-Step Programs**\n\n1.  **Using the Serenity Prayer to Deepen Faith**: The prayer can help us connect more deeply with our faith.\n2.  **Using the Serenity Prayer for Meditation**: The prayer can aid us in scenarios separate from faith or religion.\n3.  **Using the Serenity Prayer to Accept Life Circumstances**: The prayer has been pivotal in helping individuals cope with challenging life circumstances.\n4.  **Using the Serenity Prayer to Build Trust**: The prayer can reinforce our own power and sphere of control, allowing us to build resilience in the face of obstacles.\n5.  **Using the Serenity Prayer to Seek Guidance**: The prayer can help us find courage, wisdom, and guidance from a source beyond ourselves.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Serenity Prayer can be a powerful tool on our mental health journey. When we remind ourselves of what we have the power to change, we free ourselves to focus solely on what we can change. This allows us to break free from cycles of rumination and powerlessness, thereby creating more acceptance and peace in our lives.

FTC data from March 2024 reported that over $12 billion was lost to fraud in the United States in 2023.2 According to data from Robokiller, a company with an app that blocks spam calls, 7,431 robotexts were sent per second last month.3\n\n**How to Deal With the Fact That People Are Trying to Scam You Every Day**\n\n**Overview**\n\nScams aren't just something you see on the news anymore; the risk to each and every one of us is very real.\n\n*   The uncertainty caused by receiving so many scam texts can be confusing and destabilizing.\n*   Constant vigilance worsens society's overall health as people try to figure out whether someone is trying to scam them or legitimately talk to them.\n*   The weight of always being on guard can deeply affect the way you interact with the world.\n\n**Signs Fraud Vigilance Might Be Affecting You**\n\n1.  Fatigue and lack of sleep: That worn-out feeling you get from juggling too many things in your head can be even worse thanks to the amount of scam texts and calls we're exposed to.\n2.  Irritability: Sometimes you might see irritability as a result of that.\n3.  Fight or flight: A lot of the effects of fraud vigilance stem from the fight-or-flight response, a natural part of human behavior meant to keep us safe, being triggered for too long.\n\n**The Scams You Need to Watch Out For**\n\n*   Romance scams attempt to make someone feel as if they are in a relationship with a person in order to extort money or gifts from them.\n*   Financial scams-often using phone tools like auto dialers and automated texts-try to pretend they are your financial institution to get access to your banking information.\n*   Phishing scams involve impersonating a legitimate communication, like a text or email, that you are expecting.\n*   Employment scams prey on those who are having a difficult time finding a job in the current economic environment.\n*   Sextortion scams involve intimate images of themselves, with scammers claiming they have compromising photos of a person and that they will be released to the public if a payment isn't made or other demands aren't met.\n\n**Is There Anything We Can Do?**\n\n1.  At an individual level, Isaac says that it is a good idea to seek help from a medical professional if you or someone you love is beginning to isolate or remove themselves from social interactions due to fear that is being caused by scam tactics like fake texts and robocalls.\n2.  However, not all of the solutions are at an individual level.\n3.  Turner says he believes that it takes a societal response to reduce the severe mental health impacts that come from sustained levels of stress coming from being vigilant about possible fraud.\n\n**How to Manage the Stress**\n\n1.  Find a routine and resist the confirmation bias of social media: Isaac says one way to manage the stress that comes from these scams is to find a routine that allows your nervous system to settle.\n2.  Lean into personal connections and familiarize yourself with existing resources: Talk to a tech-savvy friend or family member, look at online resources, and use online tools to reduce your risk.\n3.  Remember to slow down and not make assumptions: Turner's additional advice is to take a pause and gather more information before making quick decisions and paying money.\n\n**References**\n\n1.

For one, I've never really enjoyed the smell of herbal tea, let alone the taste. I remember gagging as a little kid at the smell of my mom's natural cold remedy and immune-boosting red onion and apple tea whenever she would make it before bed. Also, famously, I refuse to drink tea whenever I'm feeling sick, preferring a good night's sleep, chicken broth, and over-the-counter cold and flu medicines.\n\nNevertheless, as I've matured, so have my taste buds. Over the holidays, I spent a month in the South of India, where-in addition to eating the best Indian food I've ever had-I was also introduced to the gastronomic magic that is masala chai tea. After consuming so many cups of delicious masala chai for 30 days, apart from searching for a good chai latte that even comes close to the masala chai I had in India at local cafés, I have also become more open to exploring other types of teas after being a certified tea-hater for so many years.\n\nSo when I got this assignment in my inbox, I said: What the heck, sure. I knew this challenge wasn't going to be easy because apart from being a coffee drinker since I was 14, and routinely drinking a minimum of eight ounces a day, having my daily cup of joe is sort of a ritual for me. Growing up in a Latine household, I was used to having my three-ounce cup of espresso, or cafecito, twice a day-once in the morning and again in the evening after dinner. Alas, I was up for the experience.\n\n**To do this experiment correctly, I tagged nutrition and holistic health experts to get their feedback on the relationship between teas and mood as well as energy.**\n\nThe Benefits of Tea Before I get into the details of my experiment, let me preface with the many benefits of tea. Depression, Anxiety, and Mood Because of its lower caffeine content, black tea can be a great way to get the mood-boosting benefits of coffee without the jitteriness and possible insomnia as a result of too much coffee, says Alicia Bigelow, ND, a naturopathic physician, holistic therapist, and Verywell Mind review board member. While teas that contain adaptogenic herbs, such as ashwagandha or rhodiola, and botanicals, like lemon balm and chamomile, can help reduce stress and promote a sense of calm, says Supatra Tovar, PsyD, RD, a clinical psychologist and registered dietitian, Rhodiola rosea tea, specifically, has been shown to have a possible antidepressant effect on humans.1 Herbal teas like lavender or passionflower, meanwhile, are excellent for relaxation without drowsiness, Dr. Tovar adds.\n\nEnergy Levels Black tea and matcha both contain caffeine, which can enhance alertness and focus, says Dr. Tovar. They also offer additional benefits not found in coffee. Matcha, in particular, is rich in L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes calmness and helps counteract caffeine's jittery effects, Dr. Tovar explains. This combination provides a smoother, more sustained energy boost without the crashes often associated with coffee.\n\n**Energy-Boosting Teas Some other teas and herbs that have energy benefits, per Dr. Tovar, include:**\n\n*   Yerba mate: This coffee alternative contains caffeine but also antioxidants and polyphenols that support brain function and mood stability.\n*   Maté may also have the potential to help with weight loss2 and the prevention of chronic diseases when paired with a nutrient-rich diet.3\n*   Green tea: Similar to matcha, it contains L-theanine, which improves cognitive function and reduces stress while still offering mild stimulation.\n*   Peppermint tea: Famously caffeine-free, but its refreshing properties can enhance mental clarity and reduce fatigue.\n*   Ginseng tea: An adaptogen that helps the body manage stress and sustain energy levels throughout the day.\n\n**I Tried Turmeric Lattes to Boost My Energy-Here's What Happened**\n\nDrinking Daily Cups of Tea So, how did drinking black tea daily affect my mood and energy? Here's how I felt after each day of drinking an eight-ounce cup of tea:\n\n*   Day 1: Despite sleeping in after attending a late-night concert the day before, I woke up this Tuesday morning feeling slightly sluggish. In addition to the late bedtime, I was also on my period so naturally I was feeling quite low energy.\n*   Around 11 a.m. I had my first cup of Earl Grey tea with oat milk. I felt the effects immediately, energized for most of the morning and early afternoon.\n*   Around 3 p.m. I hit a caffeine crash-or what felt like one. As a coffee drinker, hitting a midday slump is nothing out of the ordinary-which is why I'm usually grabbing my second cup of joe around this time.\n\nDay 2: I started my Wednesday around 9 a.m. with a cup of Earl Grey tea alongside breakfast. I felt pretty energized for most of the morning, but by the time I arrived at brunch with my friends at 1 p.m., I was ready for another cup of tea. I had a late evening class that day and knew I would be on campus until 8 p.m., so refilling my tank was in order.\n\n*   To experiment a little, I opted for a coconut matcha latte on the restaurant's menu.\n*   The tall, 16-ounce glass of matcha definitely gave me the energy boost I needed to make it to the end of the day.\n\nDay 3: On Thursday, I began my day bright and early at 7 a.m. I had my typical Earl Grey tea with oat milk alongside a hearty breakfast of avocado toast topped with eggs and a banana on the side. I was babysitting from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., so I needed to make sure I was energized for the day ahead.\n\n*   I was feeling fine until around 1 p.m. when I hit a bit of a slump.\n*   Nevertheless, given that I went to bed at 2 a.m. the night before and had a 6 a.m. wake-up time, it was hard to tell if my crash in energy was due to lack of caffeine or lack",

    "content": "**Race and Social Justice** Race is everywhere. It plays an important role in our identity and shapes our perspectives including how we think and feel about mental health. There are many mental health considerations unique to certain racial and cultural groups. The stigmatization of bisexual men, the strong Black women stereotype, and the lack of mental health services for Indigenous communities. These are just a few examples of how race and culture align with mental health and wellness.\n\n**What's the Difference Between Race and Ethnicity?**\n\nThe dictionary by Merriam-Webster defines race as a category of humankind that shares certain distinctive physical traits. 1 Race is usually associated with biology and linked with physical characteristics, such as hair texture or skin color, and covers a relatively narrow range of options. Yet people of similar complexions hair textures can be defined as different races, and definitions in the United States have changed over time.\n\n**What are the six categories of race?**\n\nWhen completing paperwork that asks for race, you may be asked to identify yourself as belonging to one or more of the following categories: \n\n1. White \n2. Black or African American \n3. Asian American \n4. American Indian or Alaska Native \n5. Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander \n6. Some other race\n\nSome may be considered to be of a certain race, Black people for example, may identify more with their individual ethnicity as opposed to race. This could apply to any member of any race.\n\n**Why is it important to learn about race and ethnicity?**\n\nConversations about race and ethnicity are key to building empathy, facilitating acceptance, understanding, and respect for those from other backgrounds. Such histories of other cultures and races are often erased or minimized from mainstream narratives, so it is essential to learn about the struggles and experiences of marginalized groups.\n\n**KEY TERMS**\n\n*   **BIPOC**: The acronym BIPOC stands for Black, Indigenous, and People Of Color and is pronounced buy-pock as opposed to saying each letter individually. The BIPOC acronym builds on the former acronym of POC ( people of color ), acknowledging that not all people of color have the same experiences or deal with the same types of injustice.\n*   **Inclusion**: Inclusion refers to the act or practice of including and accommodating people who have historically been excluded because of their race, gender, sexuality, or ability.\n*   **Diversity**: Diversity refers to the quality of representing people from a range of different social and ethnic backgrounds and of different genders, sexual orientations, etc.\n*   **Microaggressions**: A microaggression is a subtle verbal or nonverbal behavior, committed consciously or not, that is directed at a member of a marginalized group, and has a harmful, derogatory effect.\n*   **Cultural Assimilation**: Cultural assimilation refers to the act of sacrificing one's own culture to adopt the lifestyle, behaviors, and beliefs of the dominant culture group.\n*   **Intersectionality**: The term intersectionality was first coined by civil rights scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw in the late '80s. It refers to an individual's multiple identities and how they're subject to various forms of intersecting oppression.\n\n**Explore Race and Social Justice**\n\n*   Why Identity Matters and How It Shapes Us\n*   10 Types of Discrimination to Be Aware Of\n*   Cultural Awareness-How to Be More Culturally Aware & Improve Your Relationships\n*   How Embracing Your Cultural Identity Can Help Your Mental Health\n*   The Impact of Racial Trauma and How to Cope\n\n**Recommended Reading**\n\n*   Why It's Important to Learn About Indigenous Peoples\n*   What Does the Acronym BIPOC Mean?\n*   Understanding White Privilege\n*   Is It Possible to Overcome Implicit Bias?\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n*   Mental Health Effects of Racism on Indigenous Communities\n*   Systemic Racism Takes a Toll on BIPOC Mental Health\n*   The Role of Silence in Asian American Families\n*   Let's End the 'Undesirable Asian Male' Stereotype\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n*   What is the concept of race?\n*   What are the six categories of race?\n*   Why is it important to learn about race and ethnicity?\n\n**Sources** \n\nPage Sources.

    "content": "on This Article\n\n**How to Know When It's Time to See a Therapist**\n\n**Managing Your Mental Health**\n\nYou may have thought about seeing a therapist at one point or another. Perhaps you talked yourself out of it or convinced yourself that if you just wait a little while longer, the problem might go away. Or maybe you're still questioning if you should talk to someone but aren't sure it's a priority for you right now.\n\nKnowing when to see a therapist can be a little challenging sometimes. After all, everyone has a bad day or goes through a rough patch every now and again. But how do you know when talking to someone might help?\n\n**Self and Relationship Improvement**\n\n*   You Are Struggling to Reach Your Goals\n*   You Want to Improve Your Relationship(s)\n*   You Want to Increase Your Self-Awareness\n\n**Dealing With Major Life Events**\n\n*   You're Going Through a Transition\n*   You Want Some Parenting Support\n*   You Want Help Processing a Traumatic Event\n\n**Productivity Management**\n\n*   Your Mood Is Affecting Your Work\n*   Your Emotional State Is Impacting Your Appetite or Sleep\n*   Has it been tougher lately to do the things you want to or are expected to do?\n\n**Finding Yourself**\n\n*   You've Lost Interest in Activities You Used to Enjoy\n*   Your Social Life Is Suffering\n*   You Don't Feel as Happy as You Think You Could Be\n\n**Challenging Negative Thinking**\n\n*   You Want to Change Unhelpful Thinking Patterns\n*   You Suspect You Have Symptoms of a Mental Illness\n\n**Finding a Therapist**\n\nIn older, more traditional models of therapy, you waited until you were sick to get help. In fact, insurance companies only paid for treatment if you already had depression, anxiety, or some other mental illness.\n\nNow that more people are becoming aware of how important mental health is and are more open to discussing it, this older way of viewing therapy is evolving. Now, there are affordable ways to see a therapist before you experience a mental health problem (e.g., employee assistance programs and online therapy).\n\nTalking to a mental health professional early on may prevent mental illnesses before they start-and it also may help you to think, feel, and perform at your best.\n\nIf you decide to seek mental health support, you might start by talking to your physician. They may be able to help you find a therapist that is right for you.\n\nA Word From Verywell\n\nIf you're on the fence about whether to see a therapist, it might help to give it a try. Talking to someone outside of your family and friends might help you in more ways than one.\n\nKeep in mind that talking to a mental health professional doesn't mean anything is wrong with you. You might simply decide that seeing a therapist is what helps you become the best version of yourself. And talking to someone isn't a sign of weakness. After all, it takes strength to admit you don't have all the answers.\n\n**References**\n\n1.  2 Sources By Amy Morin, LCSW Amy Morin, LCSW, is a psychotherapist and international bestselling author.
