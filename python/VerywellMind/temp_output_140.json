Share Your Thoughts Related Articles How to Talk to Your Partner About Their Addiction The Benefits of Having a Morning Routine for Better Mental Health What Are the Effects of Loneliness on Your Body? How to Improve Your Relationship by Being More Present 1.    What does parallel play have to say about your relationship? A secure attachment style means you can hold your partner in your mind and heart when they're elsewhere, trusting that your partner will do the same. This confidence comes from knowing your partner is connected with you even when not directly interacting, which is a strong indicator of a healthy romantic relationship. 2.    What does parallel play say about your attachment style? Parallel play can be indicative of an insecure or anxious attachment style if it causes anxiety or panic due to the fear that your partner might not be constantly available or paying attention to you. If this applies to you, parallel play can actually be a great step forward in addressing these issues by learning to trust your partner's love and care even when they're not directly interacting with you. 3.    What are some potential drawbacks of too much parallel play? Excessive parallel play can lead to isolation from your partner, making it challenging to feel emotionally connected or intimate. It may also result in complacency, causing you and your partner to neglect quality time together, leading to resentment rather than closeness and connection. 4.    What are some signs that too much parallel play might be a problem? If parallel play becomes the default over doing things together, it's a worrisome sign. You might find yourself and your partner only doing separate activities without making an effort to engage in or schedule interactive activities like date nights or physical intimacy together. This can lead to feelings of disconnection and isolation from each other. 5.    How can you strike a balance between parallel play and quality time with your partner? To maintain a healthy balance, make sure to check in on your partner and intentionally plan shared activities that bring you both joy. This will help prevent complacency and ensure that your relationship remains strong and connected. 6.    What are some signs of a secure attachment style? A secure attachment means you can trust your partner's love and care even when they're not directly interacting with you, allowing for comfortable silence and confidence in the strength of your relationship. This is a key component of parallel play and a sign of a healthy romantic relationship. 7.    What are some potential benefits of parallel play? Parallel play can promote secure attachment behaviors by practicing object permanence - trusting that your partner exists and will still be there for you even when not directly interacting. It also allows you to enjoy activities that might not interest or appeal to your partner without feeling guilty or anxious, promoting trust and comfort in the relationship. 8.    How does parallel play relate to attachment styles? Parallel play can be a great step forward in addressing insecure attachment issues by learning to trust your partner's love and care even when they're not directly interacting with you. It promotes secure attachment behaviors, allowing for comfortable silence and confidence in the strength of your relationship. 9.    What are some signs that parallel play is becoming too much of a habit? If you find yourself and your partner only doing separate activities without making an effort to engage in or schedule interactive activities like date nights or physical intimacy together, it may be time to reassess your habits and priorities. 10. What are some ways to nurture emotional intimacy in your marriage? To maintain a healthy balance between parallel play and quality time with your partner, make sure to check in on each other and plan shared activities that bring you both joy. This will help prevent complacency and ensure that your relationship remains strong and connected. **Is Parallel Play Hurting or Helping Your Relationship?**\n\n**Overview**\nMaybe phubbing your partner isn't all that bad if you're both doing it... right?\n\n*   A version of parallel play is when you and your partner are physically together but not directly interacting.\n\n**What Is Parallel Play?**\n\nParallel play is a behavior typically associated with young children, describing the act of two or more children playing with different toys or activities separately while being physically side-by-side. It's an important part of a child's development as it helps develop motor skills, social skills, confidence, independence, and expression.\n\n*   Parallel play can also occur in adult relationships.\n*   It can be beneficial for neurodivergent folks.\n*   Ever find yourself plopped on the couch and scrolling social media while you're sitting next to your partner who is watching TV? That's parallel play—a way to feel together even when you are having separate experiences.\n\n**Benefits of Parallel Play**\n\nParallel play helps practice a version of object permanence, trusting that your partner exists and will still be there for you and love you even when they are not paying direct attention to you. This kind of security can greatly benefit a romantic relationship by allowing you to trust your partner's love and care even when they're not directly interacting with you.\n\n*   Parallel play lets your partner know that you trust them and are confident in their love and care of you.\n*   It allows you to still enjoy activities that might not interest or appeal to your partner without feeling guilty or anxious.\n*   This is about trust; trusting that your partner will be able to take care of themselves while you are doing something they don't want to do (or they are doing something you don't want to do).\n\n**Drawbacks of Parallel Play**\n\nIf parallel play becomes the default over doing things together, it can hurt the relationship. You might find that you've gotten complacent and no longer try to engage in or schedule interactive activities like date nights or physical intimacy together.\n\n*   Excessive parallel play can lead to isolation from your partner.\n*   It may also result in complacency, causing you and your partner to neglect quality time together, leading to resentment rather than closeness and connection.\n\n**What Does Parallel Play Say About Your Relationship?**\n\nParallel play can be indicative of a strong relationship because it practices secure attachment behaviors. This is the adult version of object permanence-being able to hold your partner in your mind and your heart when they are physically or emotionally elsewhere, and trusting that your partner will do the same.\n\n*   A secure attachment means you can have confidence in the strength of your relationship without needing constant reminders and reassurance that your partner wants, needs, and loves you.\n*   Parallel play lets your partner know that you trust them and are confident in their love and care of you even when they're not directly interacting with you. \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nWhile there are both good and bad things about parallel play, as with most things, balance is key. Parallel play can be the sign of a strong, healthy relationship, but too much of it can leave you feeling isolated from your partner. So don't worry if you find yourself and your partner sitting on the couch together doing different things—just make sure it's not all you do!

craving narcissistic supply\n    *   A sense of entitlement\n    *   Interpersonally exploitative behavior\n    *   A lack of empathy\n    *   Envy of others or a belief that others are envious of him or her\n    *   A demonstration of arrogant and haughty behaviors or attitudes\n\n**Signs You're in a Narcissistic Marriage or Relationship**\n\nLet's take a look at some behaviors that someone with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) may present.\n\n1.  **History of Narcissistic Personality Disorder**\n    *   Your partner talks with you when it is convenient, but they have never actually asked what your plans are for the future or how you can work together to build the life you want.\n    *   They constantly brag about themselves and their accomplishments and rarely show interest or ask questions about anything going on in your life.\n2.  **You Don't Feel Connected**\n    *   Your partner's happiness comes from external sources such as prestige at work and money.\n    *   You wonder if they are even capable of feeling romantic love or emotional connection.\n3.  **You Feel Manipulated**\n    *   Your partner will make subtle threats throughout the relationship.\n    *   They may not be direct with their words, but you'll get a sense that if you don't do something for them or give in to what they want, bad things will happen.\n4.  **You Don't Feel Good Enough**\n    *   You have feelings of inadequacy that don't match what you've accomplished in your life.\n    *   Your partner tends to put you down or make negative comments about the things that you do.\n5.  **You're Constantly Being Gaslighted**\n    *   When someone constantly denies things that you know to be true, they are gaslighting you.\n    *   This is often seen in abusive or controlling relationships and is a common tactic among narcissists.\n6.  **You Avoid Conversations**\n    *   It may seem as though every conversation with your partner ends in an argument no matter how hard you try to stay calm and not get upset by what they say or do.\n    *   The narcissist constantly tries to push your buttons to get you to react; controlling others' emotions gives them a sense of satisfaction.\n7.  **You Feel Responsible for Everything**\n    *   Narcissists think that everything is always someone else's fault, including the things that they do wrong.\n    *   You won't get an apology from a narcissistic person.\n8.  **You're Walking on Eggshells**\n    *   Do you feel as though you're walking on eggshells because you never know when your partner is going to explode or be in one of their moods?\n    *   Everything seems fine, but then something minor happens and they go into a rage.\n9.  **You See Through the Charm**\n    *   On the surface, your partner is charming, confident, and accomplished.\n    *   However, they seem this way only because they are so skillful at hiding their true colors when in public.\n10. **You Feel Criticized Constantly**\n    *   Your partner is excessively critical of your appearance.\n    *   They might make comments about your weight, clothes, or choice of hairstyle.\n11. **Your Needs Are Ignored**\n    *   Your partner thinks only about their own needs and how things affect them, not you or anyone else-including the kids if you have a family.\n12. **Your Family Is Warning You (or Is Oblivious)**\n    *   Your family has told you that they don't like how your partner treats you.\n    *   Or, your family is oblivious that anything is wrong because your partner has been feeding them lies about you.\n13. **You've Been Cheated On**\n    *   A narcissist is often a master flirt and might be cheating on you.\n14. **You Feel Unloved**\n    *   When you first got together, you felt like the most amazing person in the world.\n    *   However, as time went on and problems arose, your partner began to devalue and ignore you.\n15. **You Get the Silent Treatment**\n    *   Your partner uses the silent treatment as a power play to control you.\n16. **You're Stuck Financially**\n    *   If there's one thing that narcissists know how to do well, it's to take advantage of their spouses financially.\n17. **You Can't Rely on Your Partner**\n    *   When they make promises, you never know if they're going to keep them.\n\n**What to Do If You're in a Relationship With a Narcissist**\n\nBeing in a relationship with a narcissist can have significant, long-lasting effects on your mental health. If your partner is emotionally abusive and unwilling to change their behavior, it's time for you to reconsider the relationship. And if you decide to leave it, have a support system in place beforehand-people you trust enough to confide in.\n\nIf you continue your relationship with the narcissist:\n\n*   Seek therapy or outside support\n*   Create and maintain boundaries\n*   Keep records of conversations, events, etc. to ward off gaslighting\n*   Try to remain calm and assertive\n*   At work, resist gossip, even though you might need to vent\n*   Learn all you can about narcissism so you can recognize their tactics and manipulation\n\n**Get Help Now**\n\nWe've tried, tested, and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy",

Attachment security in infancy and early adulthood: A twenty-year longitudinal study. Child Development, 71(3), 684-694.\n\nAction: paraphrase the content using Markdown formatting\n\n**Can Your Attachment Style Change?**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nAsking for a friend...\n\n### Changing Your Attachment Style\n--------------------------------------\n\nWhile attachment style is often presented as fixed, it's possible to change your style at any point in your life. This can happen due to various factors such as changes in relationships, increased self-awareness, learning new skills, or experiencing trauma.\n\n### Factors Influencing Attachment Style Change\n------------------------------------------------\n\nSeveral factors can influence attachment style change:\n\n*   **Relationships**: Transitions from safe and healthy relationships to unsafe and inconsistent ones or vice versa can play a key role in influencing style change.\n*   **Self-awareness**: Recognizing that old attachment injuries have led to insecure attachments is necessary for anyone seeking intentional change.\n*   **Learning skills**: Being able to learn to communicate effectively, identify emotions, tolerate uncomfortable feelings, and develop emotional regulation skills is important for anyone trying to change their attachment style.\n*   **Trauma**: Trauma can change attachment styles, and self-awareness can help shield someone with a secure attachment from this impact.\n\n### Research on Attachment Style Change\n------------------------------------------\n\nThere are various studies on changes in attachment style. The Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaptation is one such study that has shown the importance of stressors across time leading to changes in individuals' attachment styles.\n\n### How to Change Your Attachment Style\n-----------------------------------------\n\nChanging your attachment style from one of the three insecure styles to earned secure attachment can be challenging. Both Goldberg and Kivett agree that the first step is to understand your current attachment style and the behaviors that go with it. Once you're aware of the behaviors you'd like to change, you can begin to do so.\n\n### Challenges and Limitations of Attachment Style Change\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nAttachment style is often deeply ingrained since childhood, and therefore, difficult to change. This can lead to challenges when you try to change your attachment style:\n\n*   You may feel that your insecure attachment style is valid.\n*   You may have a tendency to choose relationships similar to caregivers that will perpetuate the cycle of insecure attachment.\n*   Changing an attachment style requires consistent effort, patience, and self-awareness.\n\n### Wrapping Up\n----------------\n\nOur attachment style can change. In fact, we can even experience different attachment styles with different people depending on how they treat us and how we interact. It is possible to go from an insecure to an earned secure style of attachment as long as we have self-compassion and surround ourselves with positive, secure people.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.  van Ryzin, G., Carlson, E.

A tenured friend is someone you've known for many years, perhaps stemming back to your childhood or even collegiate years. They've been with you across all iterations of yourself, witnessed some of your best and worst moments, stuck with you through thick and thin, and will continue to remain by your side for years to come. Maybe it is the friend who walked with you on your first day of kindergarten and held your hand because you were scared. Or maybe it's your college roommate who knows what you did at that wild party, at many wild parties-but will never, ever tell, says mental health counselor Naomi Angoff Chedd, LMHC. You can stay up talking until sunrise or sit in silence with this friend and feel perfectly content, either way. A New Tenured Friend A tenured friend doesn't necessarily need to have a decades-long history. Sometimes, tenured friends are newer friendships that have been cemented by hours of deep bonding over a short period of time. This could be a new friend who you instantly clicked with, someone who you naturally spend a lot of time with for work or life purposes, or a person you might have traveled with or experienced something with that bonded you in a unique way. Best of all, the two of you never need to question your love, your trust, and your commitment to each other. A tenured friend is also someone you may not see or talk to every day-you may even live thousands of miles apart-but when you pick up the phone or get to spend time together, it's like no time has passed. Maybe it is the friend who walked with you on your first day of kindergarten and held your hand because you were scared. Or maybe it's your college roommate who knows what you did at that wild party, at many wild parties-but will never, ever tell. - NAOMI ANGOFF CHEDD, LMHC The Benefits of Having Tenured Friends The benefits of having tenured friendships are immeasurable.

Look for these key signs. There's a Sense of Safety & Support Tenured friendships are healthy relationships that provide us with a sense of long-term safety and reliability, Montague says.
