    "content": "What's This? Updated on October 05, 2024 By Shaheen Lakhan, MD, PhD, FAAN Dr. Lakhan is the director of NeuroDiversity, a non-profit organization that aims to increase diversity and inclusion in neurosciences. He received his medical degree from St. George's University School of Medicine and completed a residency at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center. See Our Editorial Process Meet Our Review Board Share Feedback What's This?\n\n**What Is Alzheimer's Disease?**\n\nAlzheimer's disease is a progressive and irreversible brain condition that causes thinking and memory to deteriorate.\n\n### Symptoms\n\n*   The two most common symptoms of the condition are confusion and memory loss.\n*   Alzheimer's disease slowly causes thinking and memory to deteriorate to the point that even simple tasks become difficult or impossible.\n*   It can eventually cause a person to lose their ability to respond to their environment, including becoming unable to carry out a conversation.\n\n### Stages\n\n1.  **Early Stage**: During this stage, people begin to experience mild symptoms but often still function and live independently.\n2.  **Middle Stage**: This stage of the disease is usually the longest. During this time, symptoms grow progressively worse, and memories, including long-term memories, begin to decline.\n3.  **Late Stage**: At this point, mental function declines to the point that it has a serious impact on physical functioning.\n\n### Diagnosis\n\nThere is no simple test that can definitively indicate that a person has Alzheimer's. Doctors will use a number of tests to help diagnose the condition, including neurological tests and brain imaging scans.\n\n### Causes and Risk Factors\n\n*   **Age**: Although dementia is not considered a normal part of aging, advancing age is the most common risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.\n*   **Being overweight**: Being overweight can significantly increase your risk of getting the disease.\n*   **Brain abnormalities**: People who have certain brain abnormalities have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's as they grow older.\n*   **Family history**: Having a family history of the condition may increase your risk of eventually developing it as well.\n*   **Health conditions**: High blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking are also associated with an increased risk for the disease.\n\n### Treatment\n\nThere is no cure for Alzheimer's but there are treatments that may help slow the progression of the disease and make living with the condition more manageable. The treatment that a doctor recommends will depend on the progression of the condition. Currently, there are medications that may slow clinical decline and treat cognitive and behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer's.\n\n### Coping\n\nAn Alzheimer's diagnosis can be stressful for both the person who has the condition and their loved ones. In addition to drug therapies, there are also lifestyle and behavioral strategies that can help people manage the condition as it progresses. Expect challenges, focus on being clear when communicating with a loved one, eliminate distractions, repeat things if necessary, and focus on safety.\n\n**Recommended Readings**\n\n*   **What Is Dementia?**\n*   **Conditions A-Z**\n*   **Neurological Disorders**\n\n**References**\n\n1.

People who struggle with eating disorders often become preoccupied with food and their body weight. These conditions can be life-threatening if left untreated. Additionally, eating disorders often occur together with other mental health issues like depression, anxiety, panic disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Without treatment, eating disorders can cause a number of health-related problems including cardiovascular issues, gastrointestinal issues, and malnutrition. However, with proper treatment, people affected by eating disorders can resume healthy eating habits and can improve their mental health.\n\n**Impact of Eating Disorders**\nWhat to Do If Your Teen Shows Signs of Bulimia Why Do Some People Get Eating Disorders? How Is Anorexia Nervosa Diagnosed? What to Know About Anorexia in Men\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nCould you have an eating disorder?\nDetermining if you have an eating disorder begins with examining your thoughts and behaviors surrounding food, body image and body weight. Although there is an extensive list of warning signs, not everyone will display every symptom. If you suspect you have an eating disorder, it's essential to talk to your doctor or a mental health professional. The chance for recovery increases the sooner an eating disorder is addressed.\n\nLearn More: Symptoms of Eating Disorders\nWhat causes eating disorders?\nEating disorders are complex disorders that stem from a variety of factors including genetics, cultural ideals, environmental, psychological, and biological influences. These risk factors may also include mental health conditions like anxiety and depression along with body image issues.\n\nLearn More: Causes of Eating Disorders\n\nHow can you help someone with an eating disorder?\nTo help a loved one with an eating disorder, be supportive of their recovery efforts without trying to fix, control, or counsel them.1 Instead, be patient and encouraging. Empower them to tackle their disordered eating and talk to a counselor or therapist.\n\nAre eating disorders genetic?\nThere is some evidence that eating disorders are heritable. In fact, in one study of twins, researchers discovered that 40% to 60% of the risk for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder arises from genetic influences. However, the development of an eating disorder is a complex process impacted by a variety of factors and not just about genetic influences.\n\nLearn More: What Causes an Eating Disorder?\n\n**Key Terms**\nAnorexia Nervosa Bulimia Nervosa Binge-Eating Disorder Rumination Disorder Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder Psychological Evaluation Family-Based Therapy Cognitive Behavioral Therapy\n\nAnorexia Nervosa\nAnorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by not eating enough and impacts all areas of a person's life. A person affected by anorexia nervosa may have a low body weight and a distorted body image. They also may have an intense fear of gaining weight and often use extreme measures to control their weight and shape.\n\nWarning Signs of Anorexia Nervosa\nBulimia Nervosa\nBulimia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating followed by purging or another method designed to prevent weight gain such as the use of laxatives, excessive exercises, and fasting. Due to guilt and shame associated with bulimia nervosa, people affected by this disorder will go to great lengths to hide their behaviors.\n\nSigns and Symptoms of Bulimia Nervosa\nBinge-Eating Disorder\nBinge eating is an eating disorder characterized by consuming large amounts of food even when the person isn't hungry. Typically, the person feels out of control as well as a sense of shame and guilt over their binge eating. Unlike people with bulimia nervosa, they do not try to purge the food after it is consumed.\n\nWhat Is Binge Eating?\nRumination Disorder\nRumination disorder is an eating disorder that involves bringing previously chewed or previously swallowed food back up in order to spit it out or re-swallow it. These behaviors are often done in secret because of a fear of what people will think.\n\nWhat Is Rumination Disorder?\nAvoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder\nARFID is an eating disorder in which the person affected has a strong preference for a narrow range of foods and may refuse to eat any food that is outside of these parameters. Unlike other eating disorders, people with ARFID do not worry about weight gain or body composition.\n\nUnderstanding Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder\nPsychological Evaluation\nDuring a psychological evaluation, a psychologist or therapist will use a variety of tests and assessments to measure and observe a person's thoughts and behaviors. At the completion of a psychological evaluation, the psychologist will make a diagnosis and recommend treatment options.\n\nHow Eating Disorders Are Diagnosed\nFamily-Based Therapy\nSometimes referred to as the Maudsley Method, family-based therapy (FBT) is the leading treatment option for treating adolescents with eating disorders. FBT involves the whole family and primarily takes place in outpatient settings. It is the fastest and most effective treatment for children, adolescents, and young adults.\n\nFamily-Based Therapy for Eating Disorders\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy\nCBT is a type of treatment that focuses on helping a person learn how to identify destructive behaviors and thought processes. Through CBT, a person's thoughts and behaviors are challenged and replaced with more realistic thoughts and behaviors.\n\nWhat Is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy?\n\n**Explore Eating Disorders**\nThinspo: What It Is and How It Impacts Body Image\nUnderstanding Binge Eating and ADHD\nCaring for Someone With Bulimia: What to Know\nHow Bulimia Nervosa Is Treated\nGastroparesis and Eating Disorders\nCauses and Risk Factors of Anorexia\nDysphagia as a Symptom of Anorexia\nHow Anorexia Is Treated\nThe Difference Between Disordered Eating and Eating Disorders\nWhat to Know About Pica\nAn Overview of Mental Health Statistics\nAtypical Anorexia Nervosa: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment\nBody Dysmorphic Disorder and Eating Disorders\nHistory of Eating Disorders\nWhat to Know About Eating Disorders\nCompulsive Eating vs Binge Eating: What Are the Differences?\n'I Hate My Body': What to Do If You Feel This Way\nWhat Is the Cotton Ball Diet?\nThe",

    "content": "on This Article Share Your Story About Your Experience With Loneliness\n\n**Loneliness: Causes and Health Consequences**\n\n**Definition**\n\nLoneliness is a state of mind linked to wanting human contact but feeling alone.\n\n**Loneliness vs. Solitude**\n\nWhile research clearly shows that loneliness and isolation are bad for both mental and physical health, being alone is not the same as being lonely. In fact, solitude actually has a number of important mental health benefits, including allowing people to better focus and recharge.\n\n*   Loneliness is marked by feelings of isolation despite wanting social connections.\n*   Solitude, on the other hand, is voluntary.\n*   People who enjoy spending time by themselves continue to maintain positive social relationships that they can return to when they crave connection.\n\n**Causes**\n\nContributing factors to loneliness include situational variables, such as physical isolation, moving to a new location, and divorce. The death of someone significant in a person's life can also lead to feelings of loneliness. Additionally, it can be a symptom of a psychological disorder such as depression. Depression often causes people to withdraw socially, which can lead to isolation.\n\n*   Research also suggests that loneliness can be attributed to internal factors such as low self-esteem.\n*   People who lack confidence in themselves often believe that they are unworthy of the attention or regard of other people, which can lead to isolation and chronic loneliness.\n*   Personality factors may also play a role. Introverts, for example, might be less likely to cultivate and seek social connections, which can contribute to feelings of isolation and loneliness.\n\n**Health Risks**\n\nLoneliness has a wide range of negative effects on both physical and mental health, including:\n\n*   Alcohol and drug misuse\n*   Altered brain function\n*   Alzheimer's disease progression\n*   Antisocial behavior\n*   Cardiovascular disease and stroke\n*   Decreased memory and learning\n*   Depression and suicide\n*   Increased stress levels\n*   Poor decision-making\n\n**What Research Suggests**\n\nPeople who feel less lonely are more likely to be married, have higher incomes, and have higher educational status. High levels of loneliness are associated with physical health symptoms, living alone, small social networks, and low-quality social relationships.\n\n**Statistics on Loneliness**\n\nAccording to one 2019 survey, 25% of adults between the ages of 18 and 27 reported having no close friends, while 22% reported having no friends at all. The rise of the internet and ironically, social media, are partially to blame.\n\n**Tips to Prevent and Overcome Loneliness**\n\nLoneliness can be overcome with a conscious effort to make a change. Here are some ways to prevent loneliness:\n\n*   Consider community service or another activity that you enjoy.\n*   Expect the best.\n*   Focus on developing quality relationships.\n*   Recognize that loneliness is a sign that something needs to change.\n*   Understand the effects of loneliness on your life.\n*   Join a group or start your own.\n*   Strengthen a current relationship.\n*   Talk to someone you can trust.\n\n**Summary**\n\nLoneliness can leave people feeling isolated and disconnected from others. It is a complex state of mind that can be caused by life changes, mental health conditions, poor self-esteem, and personality traits. Loneliness can also have serious health consequences including decreased mental wellness and physical problems. If loneliness is affecting your well-being, there are things that you can do to help form new connections and find the social support that you need.\n\n**Ways to Cope With Loneliness**\n\nIf you're struggling with loneliness, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can provide you with the tools and strategies you need to overcome loneliness and improve your mental health. You can also reach out to friends, family members, or support groups for help and guidance. Whatever you choose to do, just remember that there are people who can help. 14 Footnotes 1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6., 7., 8., 9., 10., 11., 12., 13., 14.

It can affect individuals of any age and is among the most commonly diagnosed mental health issues.\n\n*   Stressful situations such as moving, changes in relationships, or shifting careers can cause mood or behavioral disturbances.\n*   Adjustment disorders may be diagnosed in children, adolescents, and adults.\n\n**Symptoms**\nAccording to the DSM-5, the criteria for adjustment disorder include:\n\n1.  The development of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor occurring within three months of the onset of the stressor\n2.  The symptoms and behaviors must be clinically significant as evidenced by one or both of the following:\n    *   Marked distress that is out of proportion to the severity or intensity of the stressor\n    *   Significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning\n3.  The symptoms must not persist for more than six months after the stressor has ended.\n4.  They must also be out of proportion for the person's culture and cannot represent normal bereavement.\n\n**Causes**\nAdjustment disorders can stem from various stressful situations and experiences, including:\n\n*   Single events like natural disasters or job changes\n*   Ongoing difficulties such as launching a business or moving away to college\n\nThe way individuals cope with stress plays a significant role in whether they develop an adjustment disorder. Factors that may impact adjustment include:\n\n*   Past life experience - Significant stress during childhood may place you at a greater risk of developing mental health problems.\n*   Difficult life circumstances - Having more stress on a day-to-day basis in your life may make it more difficult for you to tolerate one more stressful change.\n\n**Diagnosis**\nThere isn't a specific test used to diagnose adjustment disorders. Instead, a physician or mental health professional will conduct an interview to assess symptoms. Routine tests may be run to ensure symptoms aren't caused by an underlying health issue.\n\n**Treatment**\nMany people with adjustment disorders find that treatment helps ease their distress and assists them in moving past a stressful event in a more productive way. Treatment often consists of talk therapy, medication, or a combination of the two.\n\n*   Talk therapy may provide emotional support, assist with identifying healthy coping skills, teach stress management strategies, and help establish healthy habits.\n*   Medication may be used to address depression or anxiety that accompanies an adjustment disorder.\n\n**Coping Strategies**\nIf you notice you aren't bouncing back from a stressful event as well as you might like, you can take steps to improve your resilience and help you feel better. These strategies may help you cope with the adjustment issues you're experiencing:\n\n*   Participate in leisure activities\n*   Practice good self-care\n*   Turn to healthy coping skills\n*   Cut out unhealthy coping skills\n*   Seek social support\n*   Engage in problem-solving\n\nIf you're struggling to feel better on your own, reach out to a mental health professional who can assist you in finding strategies that help you feel better. It's likely that most people will experience an adjustment disorder at one point or another in their lives. It's not a sign of weakness.

American Psychological Association, \"What is an anxiety disorder?\" Accessed August 22, 2023. Last medically reviewed on August 22, 2023   by Akeem Marsh, MD \n\n**Social Anxiety Disorder**\n\n**Overview**\n\nSocial anxiety disorder (SAD) is a mental health issue that involves a dread of social situations including performing or speaking in front of others for fear of being negatively judged.\n\n*   According to mental health experts, SAD impacts 7% of the U.S. population.\n*   The United States Preventative Services Task Force recommends that adults under the age of 65 get regular screenings for anxiety.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nWhile it's common for many people to experience nervousness or feel butterflies when facing certain social situations, people with SAD are extremely self-conscious and worry about what people think to the point that they often experience physical symptoms. These may include:\n\n1.  A rapid heart rate\n2.  Sweating\n3.  Blushing\n4.  Nausea\n5.  Shaking\n6.  Lightheadedness\n\n**Treatment and Therapy**\n\nPeople with SAD often benefit from psychotherapy techniques, such as cognitive behavioral therapy. Medication is also recommended to help cope and take control of the situation.\n\n*   Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help individuals change their negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n*   Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a type of medication that can be effective in treating SAD.\n*   Alternative treatments such as yoga or dietary supplements may also be helpful.\n\n**Living With Social Anxiety Disorder**\n\nWhile social anxiety disorder is not something to be ashamed of, it can make everyday situations challenging.

According to mental health experts, SAD impacts 7% of the U.S. population. The United States Preventative Services Task Force recommends that adults under the age of 65 get regular screenings for anxiety.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nWhile it's common for many people to experience nervousness or feel butterflies when facing certain social situations, people with SAD are extremely self-conscious and worry about what people think to the point that they often experience physical symptoms. These may include:\n\n1.  A rapid heart rate\n2.  Sweating\n3.  Blushing\n4.  Nausea\n5.  Shaking\n6.  Lightheadedness\n\n**Treatment and Therapy**\n\nPeople with SAD often benefit from psychotherapy techniques, such as cognitive behavioral therapy. Medication is also recommended to help cope and take control of the situation.\n\n*   Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help individuals change their negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n*   Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a type of medication that can be effective in treating SAD.\n*   Alternative treatments such as yoga or dietary supplements may also be helpful.\n\n**Living With Social Anxiety Disorder**\n\nWhile social anxiety disorder is not something to be ashamed of, it can make everyday situations challenging. It's essential to seek help and support from mental health professionals, family, and friends.\n\n*   Learning relaxation techniques such as deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation\n*   Engaging in regular exercise to reduce stress and anxiety\n*   Building a strong support network of loved ones\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n*   Do I have social anxiety or am I just shy?
