    "content": "Personal Growth Emotional Intelligence  Emotions are a vital part of the human experience, influencing our thoughts, behaviors, and relationships. Understanding emotions can help us navigate life's complexities, develop emotional intelligence, and cultivate healthy coping skills.\n\n**The Importance of Emotions**\n\nEmotions play a significant role in shaping who we are and how we interact with the world around us. They allow us to form connections, make decisions, and respond to situations in meaningful ways.\n\n*   Emotions can be both positive and negative, influencing our mood, behavior, and relationships.\n*   Understanding emotions can help us develop emotional intelligence, which is essential for effective communication, conflict resolution, and personal growth.\n\n**The 6 Types of Basic Emotions**\n\nResearch has identified six basic emotions that are universally experienced across cultures:\n\n1.  Happiness\n2.  Sadness\n3.  Fear\n4.  Disgust\n5.  Anger\n6.  Surprise\n\nThese emotions serve as the foundation for more complex emotional experiences and play a crucial role in shaping our thoughts, behaviors, and relationships.\n\n**Emotional Intelligence**\n\nEmotional intelligence (EI) refers to the ability to perceive, control, and evaluate emotions. It involves understanding oneself and others, recognizing emotional cues, and developing effective strategies for managing emotions.\n\n*   Emotional intelligence can be developed through practice, self-awareness, and mindfulness.\n*   Developing emotional intelligence can improve relationships, communication, and overall well-being.\n\n**The Emotion Wheel**\n\nThe emotion wheel is a classification system introduced by psychologist Robert Plutchik. It helps individuals understand and label their emotions, promoting emotional literacy and awareness.\n\n*   The emotion wheel consists of eight primary colors, each representing a different emotion.\n*   Understanding the emotion wheel can help individuals develop self-awareness, recognize emotional cues, and improve relationships.\n\n**Healthy Coping Skills**\n\nDeveloping healthy coping skills is essential for managing uncomfortable emotions. This includes:\n\n1.  Mindfulness practices\n2.  Exercise and physical activity\n3.  Creative expression (art, music, writing)\n4.  Social support networks\n5.  Emotional regulation techniques (deep breathing, meditation)\n\nBy cultivating these skills, individuals can develop resilience, improve emotional well-being, and navigate life's challenges with greater ease.\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n*   How many emotions are there?\n    While researchers have identified six basic emotions, there are over 27 different categories of emotions.\n*   What causes emotions?\n    Emotions are influenced by a network of interconnected structures in the brain that make up the limbic system.\n*   Can we control our emotions?\n    Yes, individuals can develop self-regulation skills through mindfulness and emotional intelligence.\n\nEmotions play a vital role in shaping who we are and how we interact with the world around us. By understanding emotions, developing emotional intelligence, and cultivating healthy coping skills, individuals can navigate life's complexities, improve relationships, and cultivate overall well-being.  **Explore our articles on Emotions** to learn more about this topic.

    "content": "1. \"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.\" National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/index.shtml. Accessed August 2023.\n\n**What is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder?**\n\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition characterized by recurring thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions). An estimated 2.3% of U.S. adults experience OCD at some point in their lives, with the condition being more common in women than men.\n\n**Causes of OCD**\n\nThe exact causes of OCD are not completely understood, but a combination of factors likely play a role. Research suggests that increased activity in certain areas of the brain is linked to a higher risk for OCD. Environmental factors such as sudden life changes, relationship troubles, abuse, illness, and stress may also contribute to the onset of the condition.\n\n**Symptoms of OCD**\n\nCommon symptoms of OCD include:\n\n*   Recurring thoughts (obsessions) that create distress\n*   Repetitive behaviors (compulsions) aimed at reducing anxiety caused by obsessions\n*   Significant interference with daily life\n\n**Types of OCD**\n\nWhile the DSM-5 does not list specific subtypes, research suggests that OCD can present in a few different forms, including:\n\n*   Hoarding disorder\n*   Ordering and symmetry\n*   Contamination and cleaning\n*   Checking\n*   Obsessive thoughts without compulsions\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nOCD is typically treated with medication and psychotherapy. Effective treatments include:\n\n*   Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)\n*   Exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy\n*   Deep brain stimulation\n*   Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)\n\n**Living With OCD**\n\nCommon issues faced by individuals living with OCD include:\n\n*   Intrusive thoughts\n*   Compulsive behaviors\n*   Interference with daily life\n\n**Helpful Resources**\n\nFor more information on OCD, visit the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) website.\n\n[https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/index.shtml](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/obse ssive-compulsive-disorder/index.shtml)\n\n**References**\n\n1.  \"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.\" National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/index.shtml.

If you are experiencing symptoms of OCD or any other mental health condition, it is essential to seek professional help from a qualified healthcare provider.  \n\n\n\n**What causes OCD?**\n\nThe exact causes of OCD are not completely understood, but a combination of factors likely play a role. Research suggests that increased activity in certain areas of the brain is linked to a higher risk for OCD.\n\n**How is OCD treated?**\n\nOCD is typically treated with medication and psychotherapy. Effective treatments include:\n\n*   Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)\n*   Exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy\n*   Deep brain stimulation\n*   Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)\n\n**Is OCD genetic?**\n\nResearch suggests that genetics may contribute to a predisposition to OCD, but there is no single \"OCD gene.\" Instead, certain groups of genes may increase vulnerability. The interaction of these genes and environmental variables likely triggers the onset of the condition.\n\n**What are the types of OCD?**\n\nWhile the DSM-5 does not list specific subtypes, research suggests that OCD can present in a few different forms, including:\n\n*   Hoarding disorder\n*   Ordering and symmetry\n*   Contamination and cleaning\n*   Checking\n*   Obsessive thoughts without compulsions\n\n**What are the symptoms of OCD?**\n\nCommon symptoms of OCD include:\n\n*   Recurring thoughts (obsessions) that create distress\n*   Repetitive behaviors (compulsions) aimed at reducing anxiety caused by obsessions\n*   Significant interference with daily life\n\n**How is OCD different from other mental health conditions?**\n\nOCD shares similarities with some anxiety disorders, but there are important distinctions between the types of disorders. In the earlier version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), OCD was classed with anxiety disorders. In the 2013 publication of the DSM-5, OCD was separated into its own unique category called Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders.\n\n**What are some common co-occurring conditions with OCD?**\n\nResearch suggests that individuals with OCD often experience other mental health conditions, including:\n\n*   Anxiety disorders\n*   Depression\n*   Eating disorders\n*   Personality disorders\n\n**How can I help someone with OCD?**\n\nIf you know someone who is struggling with OCD, it's essential to be supportive and understanding. Here are some ways you can help:\n\n*   Educate yourself about OCD\n*   Encourage them to seek professional help\n*   Offer emotional support and validation\n*   Help them develop coping strategies\n\n**What resources are available for people with OCD?**\n\nThere are many resources available for individuals with OCD, including:\n\n*   National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)\n*   International OCD Foundation\n*   Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA)\n*   Local support groups and therapists\n\n\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\nOCD is a complex mental health condition that requires a comprehensive treatment approach. By understanding the causes, symptoms, and treatment options for OCD, we can better support individuals who are struggling with this condition.\n\n**References**\n\n1.  \"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.\" National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/index.shtml.

    "content": "About This Article Table of Contents What Is Psychosis? Types Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatments Coping What Is Psychosis? Psychosis is a loss of contact with reality, typically including delusions (false ideas about what is taking place or who you are) and hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there). It impacts the way that the brain processes information. When experiencing psychosis, people may hear, see, feel, or believe things that are not real.1 Psychosis is a symptom associated with a number of health conditions including the manic phase of bipolar I disorder, as well as schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and schizoaffective disorder. Other conditions where psychosis may be present include postpartum psychosis and depressive episodes. About 7 in every 1000 people experience psychosis at some time in their lives.2 Postpartum Psychosis Can Be Fatal If Left Untreated-Here's What to Know \n\n**What Is Psychosis?**\n\nPsychosis is a loss of contact with reality, typically including delusions (false ideas about what is taking place or who you are) and hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there). It impacts the way that the brain processes information. When experiencing psychosis, people may hear, see, feel, or believe things that are not real.\n\n1.  Psychosis is a symptom associated with a number of health conditions including the manic phase of bipolar I disorder, as well as schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and schizoaffective disorder.\n2.  Other conditions where psychosis may be present include postpartum psychosis and depressive episodes.\n3.  About 7 in every 1000 people experience psychosis at some time in their lives.\n\n**Types**\n\nSome forms of psychosis are brought on by a specific condition, such as:\n\n1.  Bipolar disorder, which may involve manic episodes that can lead to psychosis\n2.  Brief psychotic disorder, which is a short and sudden onset of psychosis, often in response to a stressful situation, that usually lasts less than a month\n3.  Delusional disorder, which is marked by an inability to distinguish between what is real and imagined\n4.  Drug-induced psychosis, which may occur when a person is withdrawing from a drug such as alcohol or methamphetamine\n5.  Postpartum psychosis, a severe form of postpartum depression that, while relatively rare, requires emergency medical intervention\n6.  Schizoaffective disorder, which involves symptoms of a mood disorder and schizophrenia\n7.  Schizophrenia, which is characterized by a range of psychotic symptoms\n8.  Schizophreniform disorder, a short-term type of schizophrenia\n9.  Severe depression can also cause people to experience symptoms of psychosis\n\nPsychosis can also be induced by illness or medication or caused by a medical condition, such as a brain tumor, brain disease, or brain infection.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPsychosis in itself is a symptom of another problem, not its own illness. Symptoms of psychosis include:\n\n1.  Delusions\n2.  Disorganized, scattered thinking and speech\n3.  Hallucinations\n4.  Thoughts that jump around from subject to subject\n\nIf you think you or someone you love is experiencing psychosis, it's essential to seek medical treatment immediately.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact causes of psychosis are not entirely clear and each person's experience may be different.\n\n1.  Physical problems that can cause psychosis include:\n    *   Alcohol and certain illicit drugs, including methamphetamine\n    *   Brain cysts or tumors\n    *   Certain prescription drugs, particularly steroids and stimulants\n    *   Certain types of epilepsy\n    *   Dementia\n    *   HIV\n    *   Parkinson's disease\n    *   Stroke\n2.  Psychosis can also be caused by a mental health condition such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, or depression.\n3.  People are more likely to develop psychosis if they also have a close family member who has a psychotic disorder.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nPsychosis is a symptom of another health condition, not a diagnosis in and of itself. In order to determine what might be causing psychosis, a doctor will perform a physical and collect a medical history. They will also ask questions about the symptoms including its severity and duration. They will also want to know about any other symptoms that you might be experiencing.\n\nIn some cases, your doctor may perform special tests in order to rule out medical conditions that may be causing your psychosis. Once your doctor has diagnosed what is causing your symptoms, they can recommend treatments that are best suited to your particular situation.\n\n**Treatments**\n\nTreating psychosis depends on the cause.\n\n1.  Hospitalization may be necessary.\n2.  If you have a disorder that involves psychosis, starting or changing antipsychotics may also be helpful in keeping psychotic symptoms and episodes at bay.\n3.  Typical Antipsychotics:\n    *   Haldol (haloperidol)\n    *   Loxitane (loxapine)\n    *   Navane (thiothixene)\n    *   Prolixin (fluphenazine)\n    *   Stelazine (trifluoperazine)\n    *   Thorazine (chlorpromazine)\n    *   Trilafon (perphenazine)\n4.  Atypical Antipsychotics:\n    *   Abilify (aripiprazole)\n    *   Clozaril (clozapine)\n    *   Fanapt (iloperidone)\n    *   Geodon (ziprasidone)\n    *   Invega (paliperidone)\n    *   Latuda (lurasidone)\n    *   Rexulti (brexipiprazole)\n    *   Risperdal (risperidone)\n    *   Saphris (asenapine maleate)\n    *   Seroquel (quetiapine)\n    *   Vraylar (cariprazine)\n    *   Zyprexa (olanzapine)\n\n**Coping**\n\nIf you are experiencing symptoms of psychosis, it is essential to seek help immediately. There are also things that you can do along with treatment that may help you better cope:\n\n1.  Find social support.\n2.  Try looking for local support groups in your area or find an online group.\n3.  Understand your triggers.\n4.  Have a plan.\n\nIf you or a loved one are struggling with psychosis, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area.

    "content": "on This Page\n\n**What Are the ICD-10 Criteria for Depression?**\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) developed the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition (ICD-10) in 1990 to help diagnose patients with mental health disorders.1 The ICD-10 criteria for depression are a set of symptoms and signs that indicate the presence of the disorder.\n\n**History of the ICD-10 Criteria for Depression**\n\nThe ICD-10 criteria for depression were developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1990.2 They are similar to those of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which is used to diagnose mental disorders in the United States.\n\n*   The ICD-10 does not recognize premenstrual dysphoric disorder as a separate depression diagnosis, whereas the DSM does.\n*   The ICD-10 criteria for depression are also used in many other countries besides the United States. In fact, they are used in most of the world.\n\n**ICD-10 Criteria for Depression**\n\nThere are several items on the ICD-10 criteria for depression checklist.3 Some examples include:\n\n1.  Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day\n2.  Marked loss of interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day\n3.  Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day\n4.  Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day\n5.  Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day\n6.  Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day\n7.  Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day\n8.  Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day\n9.  Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, a suicide attempt, or a specific plan for committing suicide\n\nA diagnosis of depression requires that an individual has at least five of these symptoms for two weeks or more. Additionally, at least one of the symptoms must be either a depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure.\n\n**Types of ICD-10 Criteria for Depression**\n\nThere are multiple types of depression that can be coded using ICD-10 criteria. Below are two of the most common:\n\n1.  **Major depressive disorder (MDD):** This is the more severe form of depression and requires a person to have at least five of the symptoms listed above for two weeks or more. Additionally, at least one of the symptoms must be either a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure.\n2.  **Dysthymic Disorder:** This is a less severe form of depression and requires a person to have the symptoms listed above for two years or more. Additionally, at least one of the symptoms must be either a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure.\n\n**How the ICD-10 Criteria for Depression Are Used**\n\nThe ICD-10 criteria for depression are used in several ways:\n\n*   To diagnose patients\n*   To research the prevalence of depression and to study the course and outcome of the disorder\n*   To develop treatment plans and to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments\n\n**Tips for Using the ICD-10 Criteria for Depression**\n\nIf you are using the ICD-10 criteria for depression to diagnose a patient, it is essential to remember that the criteria are just a starting point. In order to make a diagnosis, you will need to gather more information from the patient.\n\n**Pitfalls of Using the ICD-10 Criteria for Depression**\n\nOne of the pitfalls of using the ICD-10 criteria for depression is that they are not without limitations. As mentioned above, they may misclassify some people who do not have the disorder.\n\nAdditionally, they do not take into account all of the possible manifestations of depression. Another pitfall of using the ICD-10 criteria for depression is that they are based on self-report. This means that they rely on people's ability to accurately report their own symptoms.\n\nA final pitfall of using the ICD-10 criteria for depression is that they are based on Western notions of mental illness. This means that they may not be applicable to people from other cultures.\n\n**Differences Between the ICD-10 and ICD-11 Criteria**\n\nThe ICD-11 was released in 2019, and includes some changes to the ICD-10 criteria for depression. The most notable change is that the ICD-11 no longer requires that a person has at least two weeks of depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in order to be diagnosed with depression.\n\nAdditionally, the ICD-11 includes a new category called mixed anxiety and depression. This category is for people who have symptoms of both anxiety and depression but who do not meet the criteria for either disorder. \n\n**A Word From Verywell**\n\nThe ICD-10 criteria for depression are a useful tool, but they are not perfect. If you are using them to diagnose a patient, it is essential to remember that they are just a starting point.\n\nIn order to make a diagnosis, you will need to gather more information from the patient. Additionally, keep in mind that the ICD-10 criteria for depression are based on Western notions of mental illness and may not be applicable to people from other cultures. \n\nRead More: CONDITIONS A-Z DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSIS 3 Sources\n\nBy Arlin Cuncic, MA\n\nArlin Cuncic, MA, is the author of The Anxiety Workbook and founder of the website About Social Anxiety.

You can't tell that someone is lonely just by looking at them.\n\n*   But just because someone is physically alone doesn't mean that they're lonely.\n*   The person might even enjoy that time away from others-this is what we call solitude.\n*   Loneliness, however, is always a negative feeling [because] there's something missing that we need.\n\n**Why Do We Get Lonely?**\n\nWe get lonely for many different reasons. The factors that contribute to feelings of loneliness determine the type of loneliness we're feeling at a given moment.\n\n*   Social loneliness: Feeling like you don't have anyone around; feeling like you don't belong anywhere; feeling disconnected from others\n*   Emotional loneliness: Feeling abandoned or excluded\n*   Existential loneliness: Feeling separate from the rest of the world; feeling misunderstood\n\n**The Ugly Effects of Loneliness and How to Feel Less Alone**\n\nOngoing loneliness can really do some damage to our mental and physical health.\n\n*   Increased mortality\n*   Cardiovascular disease\n*   Reduced physical activity\n*   Depression\n*   An increased risk of suicide\n*   Anxiety\n*   An increased risk of dementia\n\n**What to Do on the Days You Feel Totally Alone**\n\n1.  Decrease the stigma of being lonely: When was the last time that you said you were lonely-to yourself or someone else?\n2.  Be intentional about connecting with other people: Dr. Nobel suggests committing to a time where you make it a goal to connect with others.\n3.  Reframe the way you think about loneliness: Dr. Nobel says that feeling lonely isn't a mark on who we are.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLoneliness doesn't indicate inadequacy or some innate flaw on our part, it's just a sign that we need a little extra TLC. If you're finding that loneliness is frequent or debilitating, it may be time to reach out to a mental health professional.

Have you ever had the experience of working hard to reach a goal in life, only to find that once you get to the finish line, you're filled with depression and stress, rather than happiness? If so, you may be experiencing arrival fallacy.\n\nThe arrival fallacy stems from the idea ingrained into many of us since we were children that the key to happiness in life is having a good job, making lots of money, getting married, experiencing notoriety in our careers—just generally having a forward-thinking, goal-oriented mindset. But research has shown that those sorts of things don't bring us happiness, at least not on a long-term basis.\n\n**What Causes Arrival Fallacy?**\n\nThere hasn't been much research into the arrival fallacy and what causes it, but there has been a mountain of research on what makes people happy. When you look at factors that bring people happiness, factors like having meaningful relationships and learning how to focus on the positive top the list. However, external successes like money, climbing the career ladder, and social status do not make the cut.\n\nResearch has found that these don't usually bring happiness—at least not long-term happiness. Still, society has ingrained in us the notion that happiness is very much tied to reaching goals and becoming noteworthy to others. This notion is still widespread.\n\n**Tips for Overcoming Arrival Fallacy**\n\nExperiencing arrival fallacy is fairly common, and it can be hard to cope when you find yourself depressed or stressed after reaching a long-awaited goal. Here are some tips for coping, moving through the feelings, and ultimately achieving enduring happiness in life.\n\n*   Focus on the process more than the end goal might be the key to happiness.\n*   When an employee feels as though they have achieved something on a daily basis—even if it doesn't involve reaching a goal—they are more likely to feel motivated and content.\n*   Work on being present in the moment by adding mindfulness into your day, such as starting a meditation practice or taking time to stop what you are doing, breathe slowly, and experience what it means to be present in your life.\n*   Take stock of the things proven to bring people happiness, such as having warm connections with others, letting go of small annoyances and inconveniences, and focusing on the simple things that make you happy.\n*   Keep a gratitude journal to concentrate more on the things that bring you joy and make them a priority in life.\n\n**A Word From Verywell**\n\nIf the arrival fallacy is something you've experienced before, or are dealing with now, you should know that you aren't alone. It's common for people to end up feeling depressed, disappointed, anxious, stressed, and even hopeless after they've reached a goal. If you are having trouble coping with your feelings, or are looking for ways to manage goal setting in the future, consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor for support.\n\n**How to Find Happiness in Your Life**\n\nRead More: CONDITIONS A-Z DEPRESSION CAUSES 10 Sources\n\nBy Wendy Wisner\nWendy Wisner is a health and parenting writer, lactation consultant (IBCLC), and mom to two awesome sons.
