Genetics: Over 80 genetic variants have been linked to depression.\n2.  Hormones: Fluctuations in hormone production or function, such as those related to pregnancy, menstruation, menopause, or thyroid disorders, can contribute to depression.\n3.  Seasonal changes: Disruptions in the body's circadian rhythm at different times of the year can trigger seasonal affective disorder (SAD).\n4.  Stress and trauma: The loss of a loved one, abuse, chronic stress, and big life changes can trigger depression.\n5.  Substance use: Depression rates are higher among people with a history of substance use.\n\n**It Is More Than Sadness**\n\nDepression is an illness that extends beyond ordinary sadness, with symptoms including:\n\n*   Changes in appetite, weight, and sleep patterns\n*   Difficulty concentrating, remembering things, or making decisions\n*   Feeling anxious, hopeless, or helpless\n*   Irritability or restlessness\n*   Persistent feelings of sadness or emptiness\n*   Physical symptoms such as headaches, digestive issues, body aches,",

    "content": "on This Article Table of Contents How Antidepressants Work Antidepressants and Long-Term Effects Tips for Taking Antidepressants Long-term Use of Antidepressants A Word From Verywell Does depression medication work? If you have been diagnosed with depression or are experiencing depressive symptoms, it is normal to wonder if antidepressants work or if they can even cure your condition. If you're wondering whether antidepressants will cure you in the same way that an antibiotic cures an infection, the answer is no; they do not eradicate the underlying causes of depression. There is a lot that we still don't know about antidepressants, or depression in general. While antidepressants can alter neurotransmitter levels and function in the brain, they may not cause permanent changes in brain structure or chemistry.\n\n**Do Antidepressants Work?**\n\n*   Depression is a serious medical condition that requires treatment.\n*   Antidepressants are effective for many people with depression.\n*   There are different types of antidepressants, each working slightly differently.\n\n**How Antidepressants Work**\n\n1.  Antidepressants target one or more neurotransmitters involved in regulating mood.\n2.  These neurotransmitters include serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.\n3.  The effects on these neurotransmitters can vary depending on the type of antidepressant.\n4.  Some help the brain use neurotransmitters more effectively, while others increase neurotransmitter levels.\n\n**Antidepressants and Long-Term Effects**\n\n*   Antidepressants do not provide a permanent cure for depression.\n*   Their effects are temporary and will return to normal when stopped.\n*   Despite this, antidepressants can still provide long-term relief from depressive symptoms.\n*   Research suggests that depressed adults who use antidepressants are three times less likely to remain depressed after eight years.\n\n**Tips for Taking Antidepressants**\n\n1.  Give your medication enough time to work before giving up on it (usually 2-8 weeks).\n2.  Take your antidepressant exactly as prescribed by your doctor.\n3.  Don't stop taking your medication without consulting your doctor first.\n4.  Be patient and don't give up if the first medication doesn't help.\n\n**Long-term Use of Antidepressants**\n\n*   Your risk for depression relapse plays a significant role in determining whether you need to stay on antidepressants long-term.\n*   Factors like having multiple depressive episodes, a familial history of depression, or severe depressive episodes can affect your treatment plan.\n*   Research is ongoing to better understand the effects of long-term antidepressant use and how to minimize potential side effects.\n\n**A Word From Verywell**\n\n*   Antidepressants are effective and considered a first-line treatment for moderate to severe depression.\n*   Other treatments, such as psychotherapy, can be helpful in conjunction with medication.\n*   Consult your doctor or mental healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment for you.",

    "content": "on This Article\n\n**10 Reasons People Attempt Suicide Even If They Seem 'OK'**\n\nThere are many misconceptions about suicide that make it difficult for people to understand why someone would attempt to take their own life, especially if they seem to be doing well.\n\n*   **They may not actually be feeling better**: Just because someone appears to be doing well on the outside doesn't mean they're feeling better inside.\n*   **They may believe that their problems are insurmountable**: People who experience suicidal ideation often feel hopeless and helpless as a result of believing that nothing will get better.\n*   **Their attempt may actually be a cry for help**: A suicide gesture is an act that is intended to get attention but not necessarily cause death. It's a way of crying out for help.\n*   **They may be afraid of what might happen if they don't make an attempt**: They may be afraid of what other people will think or say if they don't go through with it, or they may be afraid that they'll never have the courage to try again.\n*   **They may have unresolved trauma or dangling loose ends in their life**: Some people experience deep shame and guilt over past traumatic experiences, and it seems they can't escape their wounds or find adequate solutions.\n*   **They may have an undiagnosed mental illness**: Mental illness can cause mood swings and periods of highs and lows. Just because someone appears to be doing well doesn't mean that they're not struggling with mental health issues.\n*   **They may feel like others will be better off without them**: Even though things may have seemed better for a while, they feel like there's no point in trying anymore because nothing will ever change.\n*   **They may not have a support system in place to help them through difficult times**: When people are feeling suicidal, they often feel like they're all alone in the world and that no one cares about them.\n*   **They may have been holding it together for others**: In addition, they may finally have the strength to attempt suicide after years of holding it together for the sake of others.\n*   **Someone may have already decided that they will commit suicide**: They seem OK because they know relief is coming.\n\n**Crisis Support**\n\nIf you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nIf you or someone you know appears to be feeling better after a period of stress, it's essential to be aware that this doesn't mean that they're no longer at risk for suicide. In fact, this may actually be a warning sign. If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please reach out for help.\n\n**Tips for Coping with Depression and Suicidal Thoughts**\n\nRead More: CONDITIONS A-Z DEPRESSION SUICIDE\n\nReferences:\n\n1  **National Institute of Mental Health**: Suicide Rates Per 100,000 People.\n2  **JAMA Psychiatry**: Associations Between Recent Financial Stress and Risk of Suicide Attempts in the US Population. \n3  **PLOS ONE**: The Relationship Between Depression Severity and Suicidal Ideation Among Adults with Major Depressive Disorder. \n4  **Journal of Clinical Psychology**: Predictors of Suicidal Behavior in Adults with a History of Childhood Trauma. \n\n**Meet Our Review Board**\n\nTo ensure the accuracy and reliability of our content, we have assembled a team of experts who review and fact-check our articles.\n\n*   Meet our editorial board members\n*   Learn about our peer-review process\n\n**Share Feedback on This Article**\n\nHelp us improve our content by sharing your thoughts and feedback.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) also requires reasonable accommodations for people who have PTSD and have a record of impairment due to their condition.\n\n**Trigger**\nA trigger is something that can remind someone of a traumatic experience.\n\n*   Internal triggers: feelings or emotions\n*   External triggers: situations, people, places, or objects\n\nWhen such triggers are present, people may be reminded of the event or even feel as if they are re-experiencing the trauma all over again. Recognizing and coping with PTSD triggers can help individuals manage their symptoms.\n\n**Intrusive Memories**\nIntrusive memories involve emotionally-linked images or impressions that come to mind involuntarily. For those with PTSD, such memories center on a traumatic event and can be extremely disruptive and distressing.\n\n*   Treatments often focus on helping people more effectively process and restructure these intrusive traumatic memories.\n\n**Hyperarousal**\nHyperarousal is a set of symptoms of PTSD that happens when people go into a high state of alert after their trauma. Even when there is no real danger present, people may respond as if they are facing a very real threat.\n\n*   Symptoms include:\n    1.  Startling easily\n    2.  Irritability\n    3.  Anxiety\n    4.  Difficulty sleeping\n    5.  Panic attacks\n    6.  Hypervigilance\n\n**Psychological Evaluation**\nA psychological evaluation is a way to assess a person's mental health.\n\n*   A doctor, psychiatrist, or psychologist may use a range of tools such as interviews, questionnaires, observations, and psychological tests to look for signs and symptoms of a mental illness.\n*   This can help a doctor determine a diagnosis and an approach to treatment based on the individual's needs.\n\n**Trauma Response**\nA trauma response is how we respond to trauma. Mental health professionals typically conceptualize this through the lens of fight, flight, freeze, or fawn.\n\n*   These responses are involuntary functions of our autonomic nervous system and take hold when we are faced with a traumatic experience.\n\n**Complex PTSD**\nTrauma that is repeated and ongoing, such as child abuse or domestic violence, can lead to a condition known as complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD).\n\n*   In addition to other symptoms of PTSD, people with complex PTSD also have difficulty with emotions, hold negative self-perceptions, struggle with relationships, and may feel detached from the trauma.\n\n**Key Terms**\nTrigger\nPsychiatric Disorder\nIntrusive Memories\nHyperarousal\nPsychological Evaluation\nTrauma Response\nComplex PTSD\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n*   What causes PTSD?\n    *   There are a number of factors that can play a role in how people respond to traumatic events.\n    *   Genetics, for example, can influence how people handle stress during and after a trauma.\n*   How is PTSD treated?\n    *   There are a number of treatments that can help reduce or eliminate PTSD symptoms.\n    *   Antidepressants are sometimes prescribed to reduce symptoms of PTSD and manage symptoms of depression and anxiety if present.\n\n**Explore Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder**\nThere are several resources available for those looking to learn more about PTSD:\n\n*   How Trauma Can Affect Your Window of Tolerance\n*   The 8 Best Online Psychiatry Services That Take Insurance, Tried and Tested\n*   What Is Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG)?\n*   Understanding ADHD and Trauma\n*   What to Know About PTSD in Teenagers\n*   How to Cope With Sibling Grief\n\n**Page Sources**\n\n1.

    "content": "**Sleep and Dreaming**\n\nSleep is a basic bodily function and an essential pillar of wellness but getting a proper night's rest isn't always an easy task.\n\nThis could be due to battling anxious thoughts, physical illness, a sleep disorder, or maybe you simply drank too much caffeine too late in the day. Whatever the reason, poor sleep quality can seriously detract from our overall quality of life. Then when we finally do get a good night's sleep we often wake up with all kinds of curious dreams to unpack-and that's the fun part! Learn more about what your dreams might be telling you, how to develop better sleep habits, and how your mind uses the downtime to work through unconscious and unresolved feelings or experiences.\n\n**What Is Revenge Bedtime Procrastination?**\n\nDream Analysts Uncover the Meaning Behind These 9 Common Dreams\n\nTips for Getting Back to Sleep Fast\n\nWant Better Sleep?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists the amount of sleep we need, by age:\n\n1. Newborns (0 to 3 months old): 14 to 17 hours of sleep per day (including naps)\n2.

Some of the habits to change include not reading and watching TV in bed, altering your behaviors in the hour leading up to sleep, and working on evening eating habits. Some skills you will develop include relaxation, not languishing in bed, and exposing yourself to more daylight.\n\nLearn More: How to Fall Asleep Faster\n\n**Does dreaming mean good sleep?**\n\nIt is possible to experience fragmentary dreams in non-REM sleep. This includes the lighter stages of sleep (called stage 1 and stage 2) and slow-wave sleep (called stage 3).2 It is believed that the dream content of non-REM is more simplistic. If REM-related dreams are a movie, non-REM dreams may be likened to a photograph.\n\nLearn More: Why Can't I Remember My Dreams?\n\n**KEY TERMS**\n\n1. Lucid Dream\n2. Insomnia\n3. REM\n4. Narcolepsy\n5. Sleep Apnea\n\n**Lucid Dream**\n\nA lucid dream occurs when a person is asleep but aware that they are dreaming. In this state, a person can take control of their dream's narrative to some degree, essentially guiding and directing the course of their dream.\n\nWhat Is a Lucid Dream?\n\n**Insomnia**\n\nInsomnia is a common sleep disorder that affects millions of Americans. This often unrelenting condition can impact sleep in multiple ways, including causing difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, waking up too early (and not being able to fall back asleep), and poor sleep quality.\n\nWhat Is Insomnia?\n\n**REM**\n\nRapid eye movement (REM) sleep is one of the four stages that the brain goes through during the sleep cycle. This period of the sleep cycle usually takes place about 90 minutes after a person first falls asleep. It is marked by a number of physiological changes that include muscle relaxation, eye movement, faster respiration, and increased brain activity.\n\nWhat Is REM Sleep?\n\n**Narcolepsy**\n\nNarcolepsy is a sleep disorder that is characterized by chronic, excessive daytime sleepiness. It is a neurological condition that impacts the brain's ability to manage the sleep-wake cycle. People who have this condition usually have a difficult time staying awake for extended periods of time, no matter what time it is or what they are doing.\n\nWhat Is Narcolepsy?\n\n**Sleep Apnea**\n\nSleep apnea is a common condition in which people stop breathing multiple times during the night due to upper airway obstruction. Because people briefly stop breathing, sometimes for 10 seconds or longer, their heart rate increases, blood oxygen levels drop, and sleep is briefly disrupted as the person wakes in order to breathe.\n\nReasons You're Not Sleeping Well\n\n**EXPLORE SLEEP AND DREAMING**\n\nI Tried Reading for 30 Minutes Before Bed for a Week-Here's What Happened\n\nI Tried Using a Red Light Filter on My Phone to Beat Doomscrolling -Did It Work?\n\nThis Underrated Hack Is the Simple Secret to Better Sleep\n\nI Drank Tart Cherry Juice Before Bed for a Week-Here's What It Did for My Sleep\n\nWhy Sleep Disturbance and Atopic Dermatitis (AD) Go Hand in Hand\n\n7 Foods to Help You Get a Great Night's Sleep\n\nWhen Dreams Merge With Your Waking Life-What to Know About Deja Reve\n\nThe Drunken Monkey Sleep Hack Might Be a TikTok Trend Worth Trying\n\nWhat Does It Mean to Dream About Being Chased?\n\nWhat Are My Precognitive Dreams Trying to Tell Me?\n\nWhy It's Harder to Sleep As You Age\n\nHow Sleep Can Affect Your Longevity\n\nCan a Better Night's Sleep Boost Your Memory?\n\nHow to Stop Nightmares From Terrorizing Your Sleep\n\nWhat Do Dreams About Tornadoes Mean?\n\nWhy You Should Try Sleeping Nude Tonight, According to Science\n\nWhat Does It Mean When You Dream About Getting Shot?\n\nWhat Does It Mean to Have a Fever Dream?\n\nMicrosleep No More: How to Prevent Brief Sleep Episodes\n\nWhat Does It Mean to Dream About Spiders?\n\nWhy Am I Naked in My Dreams Sometimes?\n\nWhat Does It Mean to Dream of Your Teeth Falling Out?\n\nWhat Happens to Your Body When You Hit The Snooze Button?\n\nWhat Does It Mean When You Dream About Being Back in School?\n\nWhat Does It Mean to Dream of Your Partner Cheating on You?\n\nWhat Does It Mean When You Dream of Someone Who Passed Away?\n\nPartner's Snores Keeping You Up?
