See Our Editorial Process Meet Our Review Board Share Feedback I Tried Meditation for My Depression-Here's What I Learned **Find what works for you** By John Loeppky Published on January 09, 2025 Verywell Mind Stocksy I don't know about you but I initially found meditation incredibly difficult to understand. I have a physical disability and multiple mental health conditions, including depression and an anxiety disorder. Even my physical disability, cerebral palsy, is inherently tied to my brain. Some days, to call me a mess is an understatement, but at least my brain damage is visible on a scan. In my mid-20s through five-ish years ago-meditation as a treatment option seemed not just sensible, but inevitable. If everyone else was doing it-even on the Canadian prairies where I live-why wasn't I? However, when I was first asked to try mindfulness meditation, I was at a loss. What do you mean you want me to sit here, and imagine the traffic floating by, and contemplate my thoughts without getting into those imaginary cars? What if I wanted to get into one of those cars? What if they were going somewhere cool? What if the vehicle was self-driving? What if they were going to San Francisco? I'd love to go to San Francisco. Sometimes, my mind would float away to my to-do list, or my day job at the time working at an arts non-profit, or the weather, or anything but the calmness I was supposed to focus on. I eventually did find a mindfulness practice that worked for me, yoga nidra, but that was after many months of trial and error. Here's hoping this article can help you find a meditation practice for your mental health a little smoother and easier.\n\n**How Meditation Can Help With Depression**\n\nThe causes of depression are complicated and not fully understood, Some point to genetics, others to physiology, and factors such as stress and anxiety. Brent Nelson, MD, adult interventional psychiatrist and chief medical information officer at PrairieCare, says that for him, the focus on the brain is a helpful framework to understand how meditation can help with depression. The brain has 100 billion neurons with 100 trillion connections, so it's very complicated, Nelson says. And the cause of depression is still yet to be fully understood, but we know it's a complex process. It's often interleaved with other things such as anxiety or trauma, and really, for a lot of people, is a function of stress meeting, maybe, an underlying genetic predisposition. Meditation, when used to treat depression, is not isolated on an island. When suggested by a psychologist, a psychiatrist, or a therapist, meditation is often used alongside medications, methodologies like cognitive-behavioral therapy, and treatments like transcranial magnetic stimulation. Nelson tells Verywell Mind that he often starts patients with mindfulness meditations. A lot of times we will start with mindfulness meditation because what it really can let people do is get their brain to be more connected, kind of in the moment, in the here and now, and less so in the distant past or anxiety over the future, which often can be a challenge in depression, he adds.\n\n**How to Get Started**\n\nJulie Potiker, a certified mindful self-compassion teacher of the UCSD's Center for Mindfulness believes that meditation is a key reason why she was able to recover from her bouts with depression. It's not at all like loosey-goosey or woo woo, or anything like that... I used to be a clinically depressed person, and I used to take antidepressants, and I had postpartum depression, so I'm really a poster child for this...Mindful self-compassion, that's what I leaned into, and that's why I became a teacher of it, and then that's why I became certified in it, she says. Potiker, who tends to focus initially on a loving-kindness meditation, says that zeroing in on self-compassion and gratitude can be especially valuable for those facing depression, in her experience. In terms of getting started, her recent advice to someone she supports-rather than building up meditation to be a big burdensome practice-was to start small. I talked to her about little micro-moments, trying to do it once an hour, Potiker explains. Where you either look out the window or you take a walk, or you play one of your favorite songs, or something that makes your body feel good, and you enrich it and absorb it for moments, I don't mean minutes, and you just really feel because it just folds right into gratitude.\n\n**What Types of Meditation Work Best**\n\nA 2015 analysis looked at seven different meditation techniques and their effectiveness. Those included:\n\n1.  Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy\n2.  Patañjali Yoga\n3.  Qigong\n4.  Sahaj Yoga\n5.  Inner Resources Meditation\n6.  Sudarshan Kriya Yoga\n7.  Tai Chi\n\n**Tips for Meditation Success**\n\nMeditation can help mitigate depression symptoms when used in conjunction with a professional treatment plan. Here are some tips to get the most out of your practice:\n\n1.  Speak to a professional about your mental health and meditation practice\n2.  Focus on something you can sustain in the long term\n3.

The Benefits of Meditation for Stress Management - What You Need to Know By Elizabeth Scott, PhD Updated on April 20, 2022 Reviewed by Megan Monahan Alison Czinkota Verywell Table of Contents What is Meditation? Stress Management Health Benefits Pros and Cons Things to Keep in Mind Getting Started Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**The Benefits of Meditation for Stress Management**\n\nMeditation has many benefits, including lowering stress, improving immune function, and slowing mental aging. This age-old practice has become one of the most popular ways to relieve stress among people of all walks of life.\n\n*   Meditation can take many forms and can be combined with many spiritual practices.\n*   It can also be used in several important ways:\n    *   As a part of your daily routine, helping you build resilience to stress\n    *   As a technique to get centered when you're thrown off by emotional stress\n    *   As a quick-fix stress reliever to help you reverse your body's stress response and physically relax\n\n**What is Meditation?**\n\nMeditation is a practice that incorporates different techniques to help people focus their attention and achieve a heightened state of awareness. It can result in changes in consciousness and has been shown to have several health benefits.\n\n*   Meditation involves sitting in a relaxed position and clearing your mind, or focusing your mind on one thought and clearing it of all others.\n*   You may focus on a sound, like \"oommmm,\" or on your breathing, counting, a mantra, or nothing at all.\n*   A common thread among the many meditation techniques is that the mind stops following every new thought that comes to the surface.\n\n**Meditation and Stress**\n\nOne of the main benefits of meditation is its ability to reduce stress. The body's stress response causes the body to automatically react in ways that prepare you to fight or run. However, a prolonged state of such agitation can cause physical damage to every part of the body.\n\n*   Meditation affects the body in exactly the opposite way that stress does-by triggering the body's relaxation response.\n*   It restores the body to a calm state, helping the body repair itself and preventing new damage from the physical effects of stress. \n\n**The Role of Relaxation**\n\nThere is an element of more direct physical relaxation involved in meditation as well, obviously, so this double dose of relaxation can really be helpful for shrugging off stress.\n\n*   Research has shown that those who practice meditation regularly begin to experience changes in their response to stress that allow them to recover from stressful situations more easily and experience less stress from the challenges they face in their everyday lives.\n*   Some of this is thought to be the result of the increase in positive mood that can come from meditation; research shows that those who experience positive moods more often are more resilient toward stress.\n*   Other research has found changes in the brains of regular meditation practitioners that are linked with a decreased reactivity toward stress.\n\n**Health Benefits of Meditation**\n\nThe benefits of meditation are great because, among other things, it can reverse your stress response, thereby shielding you from the effects of chronic stress. When practicing meditation:\n\n*   You use oxygen more efficiently.\n*   Your adrenal glands produce less cortisol.\n*   Your blood pressure normalizes.\n*   Your heart rate and breathing slow down.\n*   Your immune function improves.\n*   Your mind ages at a slower rate.\n*   Your mind clears, and your creativity increases.\n\n**The Pros and Cons of Meditation**\n\nThere are many benefits to meditation, both mentally and physically:\n\n*   People with physical limitations may find it easier to practice than strenuous physical exercise for stress relief.\n*   Plus, no special equipment is required.\n*   Unlike enlisting the help of a professional, meditation is free.\n*   Unlike some medications and herbal therapies, meditation has few potential side effects.\n\nHowever, there are also some things to be aware of before beginning the practice:\n\n*   It does take discipline and commitment to make meditation a regular habit.\n*   Some people may find it more difficult to maintain as a habit than methods that enlist the help of someone or something outside themselves for added motivation.\n*   Some people may have mental or physical health conditions that don't allow them to comfortably meditate while sitting.\n\n**Things to Keep in Mind**\n\nWhen starting your meditation practice, keep the following four things in mind:\n\n1.  Consistency Is Key\n2.  Practice Doesn't Mean Perfect\n3.  It's OK for Your Mind to Wander\n4.  Focus on Your Breath\n\n**Getting Started**\n\nThere are many forms of meditation that bring these fantastic benefits. Two major types of meditation include concentrative meditation (where attention is focused on a specific point) and mindfulness meditation (which focuses on building awareness and acceptance of the present moment).\n\nIf you practice meditation while you are not in the midst of a stressful situation, you will find it easier to use it as a calming technique when you need it. Begin at a relaxed time, even if you plan to use it only as needed and not as a daily exercise.\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n*   When should I meditate? Meditation can be done at any time of day, but it is often easiest to find the time in the morning or evening.\n*   Can meditation help me sleep? Yes, meditation can be very helpful for getting a good night's sleep.\n*   Can you meditate lying down? Yes, you can meditate lying down. What matters more than the meditation posture is if you can hold that posture comfortably for a period of time.\n\n**References**\n\n1.  Meditation affects the body in exactly the opposite way that stress does-by triggering the body's relaxation response.\n2.  Research has shown that those who practice meditation regularly begin to experience changes in their response to stress that allow them to recover from stressful situations more easily and experience less stress from the challenges they face in their everyday lives.\n3.  Some of this is thought to be the result of the increase in positive mood that can come from meditation; research shows that those who experience positive moods more often are more resilient toward stress.\n4.  Other research has found changes in the brains of regular meditation practitioners that are linked with a decreased reactivity toward stress.\n5.  Meditation offers several solutions in one simple activity.\n6.  People who meditate regularly find it easier to give up life-damaging habits like smoking, drinking, and drugs.\n7.  Numerous studies have found that, in diverse populations, meditation can minimize stress and build resilience.\n8.  Some studies suggest that meditation can be harmful to those who have experienced trauma or other serious mental health conditions.\n9.  Research suggests that the amount of time it takes to make a behavior a habit can vary from as little as 18 days to as long as 254 days.​ ​\n\n**Related Articles**\n\n*   How Long Should You Meditate?\n*   I Tried Meditation for My Depression-Here's What I Learned\n*   LIVING WELL MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION 9 Sources By Elizabeth Scott, PhD Elizabeth Scott, PhD is an author, workshop leader, educator, and award-winning blogger on stress management, positive psychology, relationships, and emotional wellbeing.

We often find ourselves craving some rest and relaxation, so that we can feel restored and rejuvenated. Enter: yoga nidra.\n\nYoga nidra is a guided meditation rooted in ancient yogic traditions that follows a systematic relaxation process, putting us in a very relaxed state that is somewhere between being awake and asleep, says Shelby Harris, PsyD, director of sleep health at Sleepopolis. It's a practice for deep relaxation, healing, integration, and wholeness on all levels of being, says Karla Helbert, an internationally certified yoga therapist (C-IAYT) and author of Tips for Calming Body and Mind: Breathing Lessons.\n\nIf you're curious about yoga nidra, we've got you. In this article, we explore how yoga nidra works, the benefits it offers, and some tips to help you get started with it.\n\n**Tell Me More About Yoga Nidra**\n\nAs old as yoga itself, yoga nidra is a meditative practice that was first recorded in ancient Hindu texts known as the Upanishads, which date as far back as 600 BCE.1 In Sanskrit, the term 'yoga nidra' means 'yogic sleep,' but the practice is really meant to help us hover between a state of sleep and wakefulness-it's essentially awareness in a fully relaxed state, Helbert explains.\n\nIf you're worried it involves something complicated, you can relax (pun intended!). Unlike other forms of yoga, yoga nidra typically doesn't require any complicated asanas, or poses. It simply involves lying down in a comfortable position as your guide takes you through the meditation.\n\nYoga nidra consists of a deceptively simple set of practices for enhancing health, healing, resiliency, and well-being at all levels of body, mind, and spirit, says Richard Miller, PhD, a clinical psychologist and author of Yoga Nidra: The iRest Meditative Practice for Deep Relaxation and Healing.\n\nThere are different styles of yoga nidra, but all include a body scan and an awareness of breath, says Helbert. She adds that many may also include imagery or visualizations of different kinds, such as nature, colors, or representations of the elements, like earth, air, water, or fire.\n\nYoga nidra moves us through each layer of our being-physical, mental, energetic, intuitive, and spiritual-allowing us to experience the inner peace that yoga teaches us is always part of each one of us. - KARLA HELBERT, C-IAYT\n\n**How Yoga Nidra Works**\n\nWhile many other forms of meditation help us relax, yoga nidra represents a unique state where we're fully conscious but we demonstrate all the symptoms of a deep, non-REM sleep with delta brain waves.2 Helbert explains that in this state, the parasympathetic nervous system-the rest, relax, and digest side of our nervous system-is activated, and the sympathetic nervous system-the fight or flight mode-is able to deactivate.1\n\nThe mind remains awake and aware, open and receptive to the messages of healing and creativity shared during the meditation, Helbert adds. She explains that this is powerful because the words, images, and suggestions of healing can sink deep into our consciousness and subconsciousness, resonating within.\n\nIn some ways, yoga nidra is similar to a hypnotic state, but it's not quite the same thing.2 A 2022 study that examined participants' brain waves during yoga nidra sessions found that some parts of the brain were asleep, while other parts of the brain were awake.3\n\n**What Does Yoga Nidra Do?**\n\nResearch shows us that yoga nidra offers several mental, physical, and emotional benefits:\n\n*   Improves mood4\n*   Boosts confidence5\n*   Increases resilience6\n*   Reduces stress levels4\n*   Boosts concentration7\n*   Improves cognitive processing8\n*   Increases alertness5\n*   Boosts memory7\n*   Enhances self-awareness5\n*   Reduces anxiety9\n*   Reduces depression4\n*   Reduces PTSD7\n*   Improves anger management5\n*   Increases motivation5\n*   Reduces insomnia10\n*   Improves sleep quality 10\n*   Reduces pain1\n*   Relieves headaches1\n*   Regulates heart rate1\n*   Lowers blood pressure11\n*   Improves blood sugar levels1\n*   Corrects hormonal imbalances1\n\nYoga nidra promotes emotional healing and helps us become more in tune with our mind, body, and environment. Practicing it regularly is believed to help create a stronger mind-body connection. - SHELBY HARRIS, PSYD\n\nA 2023 review notes that yoga nidra shows potential as a noninvasive, cost-effective, and easily accessible approach to help treat many health conditions, as a complementary form of treatment along with primary treatment.12\n\n**Getting Started with Yoga Nidra**\n\nYou can do yoga nidra at home, using a guided meditation recording. Or, you can do it in a yoga studio, with a teacher who will guide you through the steps. Either way, these tips can help you get started with it:\n\n*   Wear something comfortable: The aim of yoga nidra is to help you get as relaxed as possible. Wear something loose that you're comfortable in.\n*   Avoid tight or restrictive clothing\n*   Find a quiet spot: Choose a warm, quiet, and comfortable spot where you won't be disturbed.\n*   Minimize disruptions: Power down your devices, leave them in another room, or silence your notifications, so they don't disturb you.\n*   Keep your props handy: Keep a cushion, bolster, or blanket on hand, in case you need them to get comfortable.\n*   Create a peaceful environment: If you're doing it at home, you can set the mood by lighting an aromatherapy candle, dimming the lights, and playing soft, serene music to create a peaceful environment.\n*   Use the bathroom: It can be helpful to use the bathroom before you get started, so you can enjoy an uninterrupted session without needing to take breaks.\n\n**Step-by-Step Guide to Yoga Nidra Practice**\n\nIf",

Please note that this does not affect our editorial independence.\n\n**Choosing How Often You Meditate**\n\nDr. Monique Gary, DO, medical director of the cancer program at Grand View Health, is an oncologist who used meditation as a tool to help support her patients through their treatments. She says that she recommends people focus on a regular meditation practice so that they can feel the benefits.\n\n1. I think in order for it to be a sustainable practice, and one where you can sort of reap the benefit overall as opposed to the transactional benefit of feeling more peaceful, you really need to try to do it three to five times a week, at least.\n\nGary also founded a holistic retreat called Still Rise Farms. In doing this work, Gary uses a number of practices that include meditation. She says that finding a meditation practice that will work for you-whether that's a guided meditation, a mantra meditation, or another form-requires a certain willingness to let go of your preconceived notions.\n\n2. You have to give yourself some grace and be able to laugh at yourself to try some things that maybe don't work so well.\n\nFor her, that low stakes failure came in the form of a very popular meditation app, which she says heightened her anxiety rather than lowering it. When she's answering questions about meditation from her patients, her advice is to customize it to fit you and your situation.\n\n3. If you personalize it then I think that that helps you and makes sure that your needs are addressed,\n\n4. And you feel like an active participant in it, as opposed to a passive person who's being talked at.\n\nIn other words, more isn't always better, different isn't always better, what works for you is what is best.\n\n**What Are Your Goals?**\n\nDr. Tom Ingegno, DAMC has meditated daily for decades, and uses it as part of his professional life as an acupuncturist. If somebody's coming in and maybe they've had a rough week of work, or they got some bad health news, or, [the] loss of a loved one or something like that-we can't take that away,\n\n5. but while they're in the treatment, we try and create that space.\n\nHaving them do some breath work or guided meditation, even, can help.\n\nAs for how often Ingegno meditates. he says that he does so daily and that a digital tool known as a Muse headband helps him sustain it.\n\n6. I'm now over five years of daily meditation and I don't want that number to go to zero...I just don't want to lose that number.\n\n7. So, I will meditate. Even if it's going to be a crap meditation, even if it's only going to be for like two minutes.\n\n8. I'm making sure I do that every morning.\n\nThe length of time you're supposed to meditate at any one time in order to feel those benefits is also a point of contention. Previous research has found that between 5 and 45 minutes is often the best window and that meditating just before bed can help for those looking to reduce insomnia. In order to reach those goals, Ingegno isn't alone in using technology.\n\n**How to Find the Best Meditation Practice for You**\n\nAsk three experts in their respective fields about meditation, and how they do it, and you will get three different answers. For Dr. Gary, what her best practice looks like depends on the time of day and her workload, but her weekends provide the most space for meditation.\n\n9. It's a completely oversized bean bag chair that I like to sit on.\n\n10. And I'll sit right in the center of it and I'll really just focus on my breathing.\n\n11. And I start by remembering to take deep breaths because I find that even during the day, during the week, I don't breathe enough.\n\nDepending on what's at the front of your mind, the way you meditate can change. If you're working on a big project, a guided visualization might help, whereas as a breathing routine may be more helpful if you're struggling with anxiety.\n\n12. [People] tend to think that you've got to find just the perfect pose, and the perfect mantra, and you've got to do your ohms and all these things.\n\n13. And that isn't necessarily the case to see the benefit.\n\nAs someone working in what is historically a form of Eastern medicine, a tradition that is often discredited by Western medical practitioners, Dr. Ingegno says that the influx of interest in tools like meditation shows that healthcare can be democratized when people find a practice that works for them.\n\n14. But only if resources, like those available on YouTube and other free platforms, aren't drowned out by big money biohacker types.\n\nAnd, just like with any health practice, the way you enter into something like a meditation practice can differ radically between people. Maybe it has been recommended by a therapist, for example, or maybe you are just looking for something new to help you deal with daily stressors.\n\n15. It's one of the most accessible and flexible self-help methods out there.\n\n**Keep in Mind**\n\nThe most important thing is finding a meditation practice that works for you, but experts agree that once a day is probably an ideal target to consistently feel the impacts of the practice. However, more important than that is finding a routine that you can do consistently, and that is accessible to you.\n\n16. That may mean just a few times a week, only when you need it, or even more than once a day.\n\nThe great thing about meditation is that it's very easy for you to control where, when, and how often you do it. \n\nRead More: LIVING WELL MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION 2 Sources By John Loeppky John Loeppky is a freelance journalist based in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, who has written about disability and health for outlets of all kinds.

    "content": "**Earthing-A Technique to Help Ground Your Body**\n\n**History of Earthing**\n\nThroughout history, Indigenous societies have espoused the Earth's healing power benefits and described it in varying ways. For example, in Chinese medicine, the term Qi-pronounced chee -is defined as the vital energy that fills the universe. Ancient philosopher Ge Hong said, People reside within qi, and qi resides within people. From heaven and earth down to the ten thousand things, each one requires qi to live. This belief and study of the earth's natural energies could also be found in Europe in the 19th century. In 1891 Louis Kuhne published The New Science of Healing. Then, Adolf Just wrote Return to Nature in 1896, which encouraged people to begin walking barefoot outdoors. A few decades later, George Starr White, an American medical doctor, began investigating the use of sleeping while grounded-connected to copper wires affixed to home pipes-to improve the quality of sleep. Modern scientists continue to advocate for Earth's electrons' ability to balance our body's electrical current.\n\n**Should I Practice Earthing?**\n\nYou may want to try earthing if:\n\n1. You experience anxiety or depression\n2. You have chronic fatigue\n3. You are dealing with cardiovascular disease\n4. You have post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic memories\n5. You struggle with pain and inflammation\n\n**Types of Earthing**\n\nEarthing techniques focus on reconnecting your energy with the earth through direct or indirect contact. These methods include:\n\n*   Walking outside barefoot\n*   Laying on the ground\n*   Going swimming or taking a bath\n*   Gardening\n*   Using grounding mats, blankets, patches, and socks\n\n**How to Practice Earthing**\n\nThere are many ways to reconnect with the earth in your daily life and hopefully restore your body's natural defense system. Here are ways you can practice earthing:\n\n1.  Take a walk: Find ways to connect your bare feet with the ground by walking on grass, across the sand or the mud.\n2.  Play in the dirt: Dig into the earth and get the soil between your fingers.\n3.  Ground yourself indoors: When going outside is not an option, grounding mats come in handy by replacing the direct connection you'd get being barefoot outside.\n\n**Benefits of Earthing**\n\nNew treatments will emerge as modern scientists continue tapping into ancient holistic practices. Research shows a promising connection between earthing and measurable improvements in these health issues:\n\n1.  May Improve Chronic Fatigue and Sleep Disorders\n2.  May Boost Immunity\n3.  May Improve Heart Health\n\n**Tips for Earthing**\n\nEarthing, like other forms of treatments, isn't a quick fix. It requires patience and perseverance; however, the benefits are encouraging. Here are some tips once you decide to add earthing as part of your healing journey:\n\n1.  Speak to a professional\n2.  Stick to a routine\n3.  Pay attention\n\n**More Studies About Earthing Need to Be Done**\n\nLike with all therapy, chronic illnesses have underlying medical issues that need to be addressed by your doctor. Modern research shows promising benefits of earthing, but it will take time to determine if these earth-derived electrons work as hard as scientists hope. Earthing studies are under-researched and usually have fewer research subjects-sometimes 50 or fewer people. Also, scientists like Gaétan Chevalier, director of the Earthing Institute, have done studies that have not been consistently replicated. The lack of mainstream support and funding can slow down progress.  Read More: LIVING WELL MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION \n\n**Sources**\n\n1.  By Odochi Ibe\n2.  Meet Our Review Board\n3.

Earthing is a free and relatively quick way to positively impact your physical and mental health. Whether you choose to practice it outdoors or indoors, this technique restores the connection between the body and the electrical currents of the earth.\n\nIncorporating earthing into your daily routine may help alleviate chronic fatigue, anxiety, depression, cardiovascular disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic memories, pain, and inflammation. With patience and perseverance, you can begin seeing improvements in your overall well-being.\n\nWhile more studies are needed to fully understand the benefits of earthing, the available research suggests a promising connection between this practice and measurable improvements in various health issues. By incorporating earthing into your wellness routine, you may be able to tap into the earth's natural energy and promote balance and healing within your body. \n\nAs with any treatment, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before starting an earthing practice, especially if you have underlying medical conditions. With guidance from experts in the field, you can begin exploring the benefits of earthing and potentially find a new tool for promoting overall well-being.\n\nYou are a psychologist and an expert in healthcare and social sciences, as well as a skilled writer.

    "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-sound-baths-4783501",
    "content": "**What Is a Sound Bath?**\n\nA sound bath, also known as a sound healing session or sound meditation, is an experiential practice where participants lie down in a quiet space while being enveloped by calming sounds produced by various instruments such as gongs, singing bowls, percussion, chimes, rattles, tuning forks, and the human voice. The intention of a sound bath is to create a state of harmony within the listener by using sound waves to clear discordance from their energy fields.\n\n**What Happens During a Sound Bath?**\n\nDuring a typical sound bath session, participants lie on their backs in the Savasana position for the duration of the experience. The sound healing practitioner facilitates the session and may involve the group in chants, mantras, or rolling oms. Guided experiences can last anywhere from 15 to 60 minutes, after which participants are advised to move slowly when transitioning to a seated position.\n\n**Benefits**\n\nThe benefits of a sound bath include relaxation, an increased sense of well-being, expanded awareness, and access to inner visionary experience. Some healing sound practitioners argue that sound baths can potentially foster physical healing by clearing energy blockages in the body. Research has shown that music and sound therapy have therapeutic effects on both physical and emotional health.\n\n**Who Shouldn't Do a Sound Bath**\n\nWhile generally accessible to anyone interested in experiencing one, there are some counter-indicators for participating in a sound bath. These include individuals who have had recent concussions or traumatic events. However, experts suggest that sound baths can be particularly beneficial for people with anxiety, depression, or stress.\n\n**How to Experience a Sound Bath**\n\nSound baths exist in various locations across the country and can also be experienced at home through guided recordings or apps. Yoga and meditation studios often host these events regularly.
