Frequently Asked Questions

Erotomania, often called De Clérambault's Syndrome, is a psychiatric disorder characterized by the delusional belief that another person, usually of higher social status, is profoundly in love with the affected individual despite no evidence or reciprocation.1

"De Clérambault's Syndrome" gets its name from Gaëtan Gatian de Clérambault, a French psychiatrist who extensively studied and documented this condition. 

Although there's little real-life data on erotomania, some research suggests that the condition tends to be more common in women than men. 

"It's hard to estimate how often this occurs, but studies suggest that the delusional disorder, in general, affects around 15 out of every 100,000 people per year, with women being three times more likely than men to be diagnosed," says Gary Tucker, a licensed psychotherapist, and chief clinical officer at D'amore Mental Health.

The object of delusional affection is also often a person in a position of prominence, such as a celebrity or authority figure. 

Erotomania can profoundly impact your life, affecting relationships, employment, and your mental well-being due to the obsessive nature of the condition. This article breaks down erotomania, its historical background, treatment options, and its impact on your daily life.

What Erotomania Is and Isn't

Erotomania is an overpowering belief that another person is in love with the person experiencing the condition. This conviction is often accompanied by elaborate fantasies and obsessive behaviors directed toward the object of affection. 

It's essential to understand that erotomania isn't simply infatuation. Infatuation, a feeling that many people experience, involves intense but often short-lived admiration or affection for someone.

In contrast, erotomania is a pathological condition where there is a fixed, unfounded belief in the reciprocation of the romantic feelings the person with the disorder has. 

Additionally, people experiencing infatuation are often aware, at least to some degree, of the possibility of non-reciprocation. On the other hand, those with erotomania are utterly convinced of the reality of the romantic relationship despite all evidence to the contrary. The distinction is crucial because erotomania is a mental disorder that requires medical attention, while infatuation is a common human emotion.

Gaëtan Gatian de Clérambault-The French Psychiatrist Who Studied Erotomania

Gaëtan Gatian de Clérambault, born in the late 19th century, was a French psychiatrist whose work was revolutionary in understanding erotomania. He meticulously studied patients, predominantly women, who exhibited the characteristic symptoms of this condition. He found that they maintained unshakable beliefs in their imagined romance, regardless of objective evidence to the contrary or the object of affection's denial. 

De Clérambault described this syndrome through his research and highlighted its essential features. He proposed that delusional beliefs often had a profound impact on the person's life, which might result in severe personal and social consequences.

Signs of Erotomania According to the DSM-5-TR

Erotomania is categorized under Delusional Disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).2 According to DSM-5, the criteria for diagnosing erotomania include the following:

The presence of delusions lasting one month or longer
There's no evidence that symptoms could indicate schizophrenia
There's no marked impairment of daily functioning or obviously odd and bizarre behavior 

It's important to note that in erotomania, the central theme of the delusion is that another person is in love with the individual. This distinguishes it from other types of delusion, such as the kind found in psychotic disorders, which might fixate on other things, such as paranoia or persecution.

How Is Erotomania Treated?

Treating erotomania can be challenging due to the nature of delusional beliefs. The first line of treatment often involves medication, especially antipsychotics. These medications can help manage delusions and prevent them from getting worse. 

Therapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), can also be a beneficial add-on to medication. CBT focuses on identifying and changing thought patterns that can contribute to delusional beliefs. Additionally, family therapy might be useful in educating and supporting family members, who can help with the recovery of the person experiencing the delusion.3

Typically, a combination of psychotherapy and medication is necessary to alleviate the symptoms of erotomanic delusions, says Tucker.

CBT can help address underlying causes by utilizing cognitive restructuring techniques and aversion therapy. Additionally, antipsychotic drugs are useful in reducing delusional thinking within hours or days, although they may take four to six weeks to reach their full effect, Tucker adds. 

Although managing erotomania is possible, there is unfortunately no known cure. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and improving the quality of life for the person with the condition.

How Erotomania Can Affect Someone's Life

The impact of erotomania on a person's life can be devastating. Fixating on the delusional romantic relationship often consumes a significant portion of the person's daily life, leading to neglect of personal responsibilities, including work and relationships. 

The constant pursuit and obsession can lead to stalking behaviors, which may result in legal issues. It can also be distressing and potentially dangerous for the person who is the object of the delusional affection, as they may feel harassed or threatened. 

Moreover, the inability of the affected individual to recognize the delusional nature of their beliefs may hinder relationships with friends and family members who may be trying to provide support or help.

According to Dr. Elizabeth Campbell, a licensed psychologist and family therapist, erotomania can exert profound influences on an individual's existence, resulting in enduring anguish, compromised capabilities, and strained interpersonal connections. 

Those affected by erotomania may encounter social seclusion, employment challenges, and legal repercussions stemming from their delusional convictions and actions, thereby detrimentally impacting their overall well-being. 

It's important to note that while people with erotomania are not generally prone to violence, they face significant stigmatization and misconceptions surrounding their illness.

Erotomania in Real Life and Pop Culture

Below are some of the most famous erotomania cases (both real and fiction):

John Hinckley Jr.: He attempted to assassinate President Ronald Reagan. Hinckley was fixated on the actress Jodie Foster and believed that he would gain her admiration and love by committing this act.
Mark David Chapman, who murdered John Lennon, was believed to suffer from erotomania. He held delusions that Lennon communicated with him through music and that they were destined to be together. While most individuals with erotomania are not violent, such cases garner attention, perpetuating the misconception that mental illness usually leads to violence, Dr. Bethy explains. 
The Netflix series 'You' revolves around a character named Joe Goldberg, who becomes obsessed with women he believes are in love with him. He goes to great lengths, including stalking and murder, to protect and nurture these delusional relationships. 
The Amazon Prime series 'Swarm.' Without giving away the entire plot, the show is centered around a character who develops erotomania towards a public figure and engages in increasingly dangerous behaviors due to his delusional beliefs.

What This Means For You

Understanding, identifying, and treating erotomania is critical to mitigating its potentially devastating effects on the lives of those affected and the people around them. Through medication, therapy, and support, people with erotomania can work towards managing their symptoms and improving their quality of life.
