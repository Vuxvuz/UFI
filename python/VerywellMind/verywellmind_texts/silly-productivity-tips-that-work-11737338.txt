If you've ever found yourself swearing you'll start that task right after this one video (or snack, or scroll), you're not alone-and you're definitely not lazy. 

Sometimes, the best way to jumpstart productivity is to lean into unconventional (even silly-sounding) strategies that actually work with your brain instead of fighting against it.

Here, we're sharing productivity tips that might make you raise an eyebrow-but mental health experts, coaches, and real-life humans say they work wonders. You'll find expert-backed explanations, plus relatable examples of how people use these oddball methods in their everyday routines. 

1. Trick Your Brain with Tiny Steps

Therapist Risa Williams, LMFT, author of "The Procrastination Playbook," swears by this sneaky psychological trick: make the first step laughably small.

"Make it sound so easy that your brain has trouble resisting doing it," says Williams. "Instead of telling yourself you have to write a chapter, tell yourself all you have to do is open the document and type the title."

And that's it. Seriously. Then you close the laptop.

Oddly enough, most of us end up doing more than we planned-because getting started is the hardest part. Williams calls this the "Ridiculously Easy First Step" technique, and it's magic for overcoming the pressure of perfectionism. 

2. Blast Your "Hype Playlist"

You know that one song that makes you instantly dance like no one's watching? That's the energy we're looking for here.

Sam Dylan Finch, a neuro-affirming peer support coach with AuDHD, calls this their "Hype Playlist" strategy-and it's not just about playing bops.

"They need to be songs that, if you heard them at a wedding, you'd be dashing to the dance floor instinctually," Finch explains. "It's nostalgic, upbeat music that literally gets you into your body and moves you."

According to Finch, the combination of music and nostalgia engages our reward processing system and supports emotional regulation.1

Finch recommends playing your hype playlist the moment you catch yourself stuck in a distraction loop-whether you're doomscrolling or procrastinating on basic self-care. By letting the music jolt you into movement, you're leveraging dopamine and body awareness to support emotional regulation and task-switching.

Finch's own playlist includes songs like "Cotton Eye Joe" and the Pokémon theme. They say this combo of movement and music helps "unglue" their attention and reorient toward whatever task needs doing. 

3. Count Down Like You're About to Dance

Feeling paralyzed before starting something? Say it with us: "5, 6-5, 6, 7, 8!"

This one pairs well with your Hype Playlist. Finch encourages clients to use verbal cues like "3, 2, 1-LET'S GO!" or dance-style countdowns. Add a physical motion-stand up, clap, shake out your arms-and suddenly you're in motion.

This tip is similar to the five-second rule for procrastination, popularized by Mel Robbins. You count down from five, and then you do the thing.

"This is what's called an 'interstitial action,'" Finch explains. "We're physically signaling to ourselves that we're ending the previous activity and moving on to something else."

You might have heard about "interstitial journaling," which is where you help yourself transition from one task to another by writing about what you did and what you plan to do next. 

We're physically signaling to ourselves that we're ending the previous activity and moving on to something else.

- SAM DYLAN FINCH, NEURO-AFFIRMING COACH

While interstitial journaling can be helpful, many people-especially people with ADHD-may find verbal cues and movement more helpful for transitioning to the next task, Finch says. 

Think of it as choreographing your transition between tasks. The key isn't perfection-it's momentum. 

4. Ditch the To-Do List for a Calendar

For the past few years, I've been following a planning method called Power Planning. It was designed by Sam Laura Brown, a perfectionism coach who runs a podcast called The Perfectionism Project. 

Instead of working straight from a to-do list, I take an hour a week to schedule all my tasks into my Google calendar. If plans change, I can always tweak my calendar to adjust to the new plan.

It's kinda like time blocking-but better.

This helps because:

It's realistic. When you have to fit everything into a calendar, you have to be more realistic about your time. This means you're less likely to overload yourself with work. 
It eliminates decision fatigue. I don't have to stare at my to-do list and figure out what to do first-instead, I consult my plan and work on that. 
It's adaptable. Power Planning is built to be flexible. It makes it easier to change my plans if something unexpected comes up-I just tweak my calendar and move along. 

For someone who tends to burn out easily, I find working from a calendar to be far better. I don't just schedule work but also time to rest, socialize, exercise, sleep, eat, and ponder-all of which helps me stay relaxed, healthy, and balanced. 

5. Use Music Like a Task Timer

If you can dance your way through a task, why not soundtrack your productivity?

Williams recommends using a "task playlist"-one or two upbeat songs-to give yourself a set amount of time to clean, sort paperwork, or power through emails.

"We can use this for tasks and chores we need to do," she says. "Pick a playlist that gets the energy going… it can feel more fun than just using a timer."

It's different to a Hype Playlist, as you're using the task playlist as a timer and not just a general feel-good playlist. 

Another music-related hack? Give your task a theme song. In her book, Williams refers to this as your "task anthem"-one specific song you associate with a particular chore. 

Think of it like musical muscle memory.

6. Rate Tasks by "Intensity," Not Importance

Sometimes it's not about time management-it's stress management. Williams suggests breaking a task into smaller steps and rating them by "intensity"-a tool she details in her book, "Get Stuff Done Without the Stress."

This pairs well with the "Ridiculously Easy First Step," but takes it further. 

"You can rate tasks or pieces of the task in this way," she says, "and then tackle the low-intensity parts first."

This way, you start with the parts that feel easiest, giving you a win and some momentum before you face the hard stuff. It's especially useful if your to-do list feels overwhelming or emotionally charged.

7. Move First, Think Later

Overthinking often sabotages productivity. Instead, try using your body to lead the way.

This one's backed by Finch's movement-based interstitial action trick-but it's also a strategy many neurodivergent folks use instinctively. Need to write an email? Walk in a circle first. Need to fold laundry? Do one stretch or body shake.

It sounds silly. But if you try it, you might be surprised at how just moving disrupts the "I'm stuck" loop.

8. Narrate Your Day Like a Sports Commentator

Okay, bear with us. If you live alone-or don't mind sounding weird-try narrating your actions aloud.

This might sound wild, but I narrate my tasks like I'm on a cooking show: 'OK, we're going to rinse the mug now… excellent technique!' I feel less like I'm doing chores and more like I'm starring in a cozy reality show.

When I'm working on something tough-say, a difficult project or starting a new habit-I like to imagine myself years from now, talking about it on a podcast or talk show. I ask myself:

What would future me say about this?
If my success is inevitable, exactly which actions would I take right now?
How good will I feel once this is done?

It may feel absurd at first, but for many, this adds novelty and engagement to otherwise boring routines. And it's great if you're struggling to concentrate-it keeps your brain focused on one step at a time.

9. Celebrate Every Micro-Win

Yes, really. Clap for yourself after sending that scary email. Do a little dance after making your bed. Say "HECK YES I DID THAT" out loud.

Tiny celebrations reinforce positive behaviors-and they tap into the reward center of your brain, giving you a dopamine bump for doing the thing you didn't want to do.

Williams says the key to motivation is "making it feel good to do things that are hard for you." Even if that means happy-dancing like a dork every time you clean your inbox.

Takeaways

Productivity doesn't always require bullet journals, perfect lighting, or strict schedules. Sometimes, the most effective tools are the ones that meet you exactly where you are-with a sense of humor, self-compassion, and just enough dopamine to get going.

Whether it's dancing to nostalgic hits, counting down like a choreographer, or narrating your chores like a baking show host, the best productivity tip is the one that actually works for you-no matter how silly it sounds. 

You've got this. And if not? Just press play on your Hype Playlist and try again.
