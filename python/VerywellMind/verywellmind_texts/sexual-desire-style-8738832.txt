How to Embrace Your Sexual Desire Style

There's a classic dating dilemma that we all face. Do you go for the slow burn or the instant spark? Are you a 'slow and steady wins the race' or a get to the destination as fast as possible type of person? The answer may come down to how you view sexual desire, which falls into three styles: spontaneous, responsive, and context-dependent. These styles essentially detail how you show up in intimacy. One isn't better than the other; they're all equally valid (and fun!) in their own ways.

Read on to learn the differences between a spontaneous, responsive, and context-dependent sexual desire style and how they impact you and your partner's sex life.

What Is a Spontaneous Sexual Desire Style?

Spontaneous sexual desire is exactly what it sounds like: instant, physical chemistry. Think of those movie scenes where two people lock eyes across a dance floor, and they're immediately drawn to each other. This desire doesn't need much buildup and can come out of nowhere-the physical attraction is enough for the connection to hit. 

"Spontaneous desire can appear as a spontaneous sexual thought or the initiation of intimacy," says Dr. Somi Javaid, OB-GYN and sexual health expert. Spontaneous sexual desire doesn't need much external stimuli, she notes. Erotic arousal can appear instantaneously with little to no action. 

"Men are more likely to experience spontaneous desire over women," Dr. Javaid points out. "This theory is due to biological, psychological, and social factors. Men have much higher levels of testosterone1 than women and this may lead to this difference." 

Testosterone's hormonal influence shapes cultural perceptions of desire, often developing a view of men's arousal as on-demand. This is similar to the instant gratification telegraphed in traditional pornography, where orgasms are visually driven and quick to the point. However, this perspective oversimplifies the complex spectrum of desire that operates in a fluid space.

Benefits and Challenges 

In dating, spontaneous sexual behavior often means the pace can pick up exhilaratingly fast. Intimacy might happen on a whim, intensely powered by a thrilling chemistry. If you have a spontaneous sexual desire style, you have a strong connection to your body. You know immediately when you're turned on, which can feel energizing, flirty, and unpredictable. 

The challenge arises when your partner isn't on the same page with you sexually, abruptly pumping the brakes and leaving you both confused. Slowing your desire down can lead to misunderstandings and a sense of rejection that your partner isn't "there" yet.

With that said, viewing spontaneous sexual desire as a simple on/off switch misses the nuance of this style. You might have a spontaneous sexual desire but it's not always present and consistent. Sexual desire can ebb, flow, and present itself at different stages of the relationship depending on the context. 

How to Enhance a Spontaneous Sexual Desire Style

Spontaneous sexual desire is akin to the beginning moments of the honeymoon stage. Everything is fun, new, and exciting until it isn't. To better develop and maintain your spontaneous sexual desire, Dr. Javaid suggests communicating your body, anatomy, preferences, and needs to your partner. This, in turn, will help you both create an atmosphere that's sexually stimulating.

"Communication with your partner is key to enhancing your sexual life and health," she says. "Do not be afraid to share what feels good and what you do not like." Discuss your immediacy to sex, and how easily you can get into the mood without much planning or foreplay. 

"Having fun and being willing to try new things with your partner can also help with communication and ultimately achieving your sexual health goals," Dr. Javaid says.

Tip: Add sex toys, flirty text messages, lingering touches, intentional date nights, or written/audio erotica into the mix to get you both turned on and in sync.

How to Cope With Sexual Frustration
What Is a Responsive Sexual Desire Style?

Responsive sexual desire is the type of attraction that kicks in once intimacy unfolds. Physical intimacy and foreplay are needed to turn on the desire. This style happens gradually and then all at once.

It's like when you're watching a movie with your S.O. and they slowly move their hand up and down your leg, massaging it. The environment turns sexual and your body responds accordingly.

Dr. Stephanie Jona Buehler, psychologist and sex therapist, defines responsive sexual desire as a reaction to an external stimulus. "It could be an emotional connection with a partner or an affectionate touch," she says. "The idea is that a person has no biological urge or sexual thoughts or fantasies, but something happened that caused them to at least consider the possibility of having sex."

Benefits and Challenges

The key benefit of a responsive sexual desire is that you're game to be intimate when your partner helps you get in the mood. The pace is slower, but the build-up can be delicious as you use kissing, foreplay, and whatever gets you hot to transition into sex.

The challenge is when a partner looks for ardent enthusiasm and misinterprets a lack of initiation as a lack of attraction. This can mistakenly create feelings of insecurity, confusion, and frustration, as the anticipation may become a barrier rather than an exciting part of the experience. 

Dr. Buehler notes another challenge-responsive desire may not be viewed as a legitimate form of sexual desire. "What seems 'normal' is to have a biological urge to have sex, to feel revved up, and to seek out a partner actively," she says. "When someone doesn't feel a spontaneous desire, they may infrequently or never seek out their partner. Partners can then talk about the kinds of behaviors that increase the likelihood that responsive desire will occur."

How to Enhance a Responsive Sexual Desire Style

Similarly to a spontaneous sexual desire, communication will be your ally. Talk about what sets the mood for you and the type of foreplay you're interested in. Remember: it's okay if it takes you a while to get into the moment. There's nothing to feel ashamed about. 

Tip: Dr. Buehler also recommends tuning into the things that you're likely to respond to, whether that's being told you're attractive, receiving a specific type of touch, feeling adequately bonded, having rest, or wanting to spend intimate time without the expectation of sex. 

Sexual desire ebbs and flows, so it's crucial to communicate how your responsive sexual desire can change over time. "It doesn't mean you think your partner is less attractive, it only means that things may have shifted for the time being," Buehler notes.

What to Do If Your Partner Is Not Interested in Sex
What Is A Context-Dependent Sexual Style?

Some people predominantly identify with one type, others blend both styles together. Personally, I identify with a context-dependent sexual desire-I oscillate between both styles. I don't predominantly lead with one or the other. Sometimes, I have a responsive sexual desire where it takes my partner touching me in bed to escalate further. Sometimes, I get turned on and need to have spontaneous sex with him at that very moment.

In short, it just depends on how I'm feeling. I have many friends who experience different styles depending on where they're at in the relationship. They might start with a spontaneous sexual style during the honeymoon stage and then slow down into a responsive sexual style as their relationships stabilize. If you relate to both spontaneous and responsive styles, you may have a context-dependent sexual style.

Benefits and Challenges

Having a context-dependent sexual style offers a flexible approach to the bedroom. Since you can toggle between both styles, there's potential for varied sexual experiences based on your mood, how you're feeling in the relationship, and the environment you're in.

The inconsistency may prove to be a challenge, where certain conditions change how you respond to sex. If you're stressed from work, you may not feel as excited to sneak in a quickie before you head off to whatever task is left on your to-do list. Or, feel up to a make-out when you're feeling sweaty from the gym. Arousal can fluctuate and subsequently, impact cues of desire on any given day.

How to Enhance a Context-Dependent Sexual Style

Being mindfully present is one way to enhance this sexual desire style. As you relax and connect with your breath, you are engaged with your body and may feel more primed to embrace a spontaneous sexual desire.

Focusing on your partner's emotional state helps too. Are they open to intimacy tonight-and if so, what do they need to get into the mood? Setting the right ambiance can prime you and your partner for intimacy.

Try This

That can look like cuddling in a cozy room with dim lighting, and your favorite TV show on. Similarly to the responsive sexual style, playful, non-sexual touch without the expectation of sex can help you get more in the mood.

Now that you know the differences between all styles, think about which one resonates with you.

Biology and Psychological Factors Affect Your Sexual Desire Style

Your sexual desire-and your desire style-is impacted by many factors. Javaid emphasizes that the hormones in our biology,2 along with social influences like our upbringing, media exposure, religion, and friends, all play a big role in shaping how we view sexuality. On top of that, psychological factors like mental health, the quality of our relationships, and our self-esteem are also important.

Buehler recommends keeping a log to better figure out your style. "Note when you felt spontaneous desire and when you experienced responsive desire, and the 'outcome' of that experience," she suggests. "You can also note what else is happening in your life. Were you under a lot of stress-or were you on vacation? You can begin to notice patterns and perhaps share this information with your partner."

How to Embrace and Communicate Your Sexual Desire Style

There is no right or wrong way to experience desire. Knowing which style your body likes helps reduce internal and external conflict. You know what gets you off and you can now confidently express that without judgment or shame. 

Everyone has a different relationship to sex. Embrace what's best for you. 

Naturally, having the conversation can feel awkward but it can also be incredibly heart-opening! If one of you is highly responsive and the other leans more spontaneous, the desire discrepancy doesn't have to be a dealbreaker. Rather, now that you both understand where the other is coming from, you can work through your differences, strengthen your relationship, and ultimately enhance your sex life. 

"Open communication is always crucial, and being gentle with oneself while shifting one's understanding is a good idea," Buehler says. "If a person is still struggling or having difficulty understanding what is happening, they may want to seek out professional help from a sex therapist."
