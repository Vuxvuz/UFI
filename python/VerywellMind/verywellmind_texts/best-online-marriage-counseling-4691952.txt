Why Trust Verywell Mind

There are as many reasons to seek couples therapy as there are, well, couples: perhaps you want to work through a reoccurring issue, improve communication, or gain better tools to handle stress. Or maybe you want to keep a finely tuned relationship humming. No matter why you're seeking it, couples therapy can be an effective way to be happier with your partner.1

As a licensed social worker and former therapist, I am all for couples therapy-and I recognize that online couples therapy is often more affordable and convenient than in-person sessions. Over the last three years, I've overseen extensive testing of 55 different online therapy companies and have thoroughly reviewed all of their therapy services, including couples counseling. If you're seeking couples therapy, these are the services I recommend.

What I Like About Regain

I had six testers try out Regain's couples therapy, and in every case, my testers liked that they could message their therapist anytime through the patient portal and generally received prompt and personalized messages. Regain also differs from other online couples therapy services by offering sessions both for couples and for individuals wanting relationship advice and support, a service my testers tried twice.

In addition, my testers especially appreciated that they and their partners could attend their sessions from different locations, making Regain even more convenient-and convenience like this can be the difference between being able to attend couples therapy and not.

Three of my testers were very pleased with the therapists they were assigned. They found their therapists to be friendly, warm, and approachable while still being professional-it was clear that these therapists were well-versed in couples counseling and helped my testers set goals and work through problems, which is what many couples seeking therapy together want or need to do.

The magic of online therapy lies in finding the right therapist for you and your partner. The good thing about Regain is how easy it is to switch therapists until you find such a person. My testers needed to switch therapists multiple times across all our testing, and the process couldn't have been simpler. While the testers sometimes didn't jive with the first person they met with, almost all the testers eventually found someone that suited their needs. To better help with the search, Regain allows you to filter for identities like gender, sexuality, and race.

My 100 surveyed Regain users were mostly happy with their experiences:

93% of users said it was easy or very easy to find therapists who fit the criteria they were looking for, vastly out-performing every other company
87% rated Regain as very good or excellent overall

What I Like About Online-Therapy.com

What makes Online-Therapy.com my first choice? A combination of effective therapy and comprehensive support. I had two different people try Online-Therapy.com's couples therapy services, and we were not disappointed. The main thing that stood out to me about my testers' experiences was just how heard and understood their couples therapists made them and their partners feel. Engaging both clients and assessing the way they function as a unit as well as individually is fundamental to good couples therapy, and based on our experiences with this company, that's exactly what you can expect from your Online-Therapy.com therapist.

Both therapists my testers worked with gave them and their partners space to explore their feelings, voice their concerns, and really hear each other-evidence of deft and skilled couples therapists. But the support didn't stop there. With worksheets to complete together between sessions that strengthened the skills my testers were developing with their therapists and unlimited messaging with their therapists between sessions, Online-Therapy.com sets its couples up for success. 

In addition to testing Online-Therapy.com ourselves, I also surveyed 100 users of the company to better understand the quality of the services on offer. Survey responders include, but were not limited to, those using couples therapy services:

91% percent of users rated Online-Therapy.com as very good or excellent overall-among the highest ratings of all 55 companies reviewed
90% rated their therapist's qualifications as very good or excellent

What I Like About Talkspace

I've tested Talkspace all across the country eleven different times, including trying out its couples therapy three times, and what stood out each time was the kindness of our therapists. A successful couples therapist will be friendly but professional, putting both clients at ease and asking insightful questions, and that's exactly what my testers and their partners experienced with their providers.

Clearly attuned to my testers' needs, their Talkspace therapists helped them delve deeper into their thoughts and gave them actionable tools that they could take from their sessions to implement at home-which is ultimately one of the main goals of couples therapy.

While texting has become more common as an offering with online therapy services, sometimes it's more of a throwaway or used for scheduling, rather than actual support. That's not the case with Talkspace. My testers felt good about their therapy session even when the session took place via text message rather than as a video session. Their therapist was able to establish a great rapport even without being able to see or hear my tester and her husband, and still provided useful suggestions and demonstrated insight into their relationship just through text. That's a sign of a great therapist.

And the best part? Talkspace accepts a wide range of insurance plans, even for its couples therapy-which is very unusual for this kind of counseling, online or not.

The 100 Talkspace users I surveyed had similarly positive feelings about the company. Survey responders include, but were not limited to, those using couples therapy services:

69% of users were able to find a therapist who met all of their needs-one of the highest percentages across all 55 companies surveyed
89% rated their therapist's qualifications as very good or excellent
92% rated the quality of the company overall as very good or excellent

What I Like About Growing Self

Growing Self offers a particular focus on couples therapy and a wide range of relationship coaching services, including dating coaching, breakup counseling, and everything in between. From being able to choose your own therapist (with bios easily available on the website) to having a free consultation to confirm your choice is the right one, Growing Self's personalized services stood out to me and my testers-and the tester duo who tried Growing Self's couples therapy had a stellar experience. This kind of effort to make sure you and your partner find the right therapist the first time can potentially save you hours of hard work-and disappointment. 

From the very first session, my tester and her partner felt that their therapist worked hard to make them feel seen and understood as a couple. She delved into both their pasts right away, making it clear that a deep dive was going to help them pave their way to a better future-and considering how difficult it can be to talk about more intense issues, especially with your partner, the care and compassion my testers received from their Growing Self therapist was invaluable.

They also especially appreciated the time the therapist took to really understand both members of the couple, which assured them that their therapist was doing everything in her power to get the most thorough and accurate information about both my tester and her partner. 

The 100 users of Growing Self I surveyed had similarly positive experiences. Survey responders include, but were not limited to, those using couples therapy services:

93% rated their therapist's qualifications as very good or excellent-one of the highest scores across all 55 online therapy companies we reviewed
96% of users reported that Growing Self is better or much better than other therapy services they'd used in the past

What I Like About Modern Intimacy

It's fair to say that sex is an important part of most romantic relationships, and this is where Modern Intimacy stands out against other couples counseling services-it offers online sex therapy. I had one tester try this type of therapy with her husband, and to say they were pleasantly surprised at the quality of their care would be an understatement.

Sex therapy focuses on intimacy issues, both physical and emotional, that might be affecting a couple's sex life, and helps the couple explore and work through those issues in order to develop a healthier sexual relationship that works for both parties. One of the main purposes of sex therapy-and one of Modern Intimacy's specialties-is to help couples connect (or reconnect), and that's precisely what my tester and her husband were looking for: to bolster and maintain their emotional and physical closeness. Even by their second session, they found it much easier to talk about their sex life because the focus was on their connection. 

My tester especially appreciated that their therapist was very good at helping them be honest about what wasn't working in their relationship without leaving them in the middle of a conflict at the end of the session-other couples therapy services we've tested consistently abandoned us in the middle of a fight, making the time between sessions fraught with tension. Not so at Modern Intimacy. In fact, my tester noted that the tone at home changed for the better after they were able to discuss the things they needed to improve about their relationship, such as how to better communicate in moments of anger or frustration. When you get tangible results like this from your couples therapy, it's time to sit up and pay attention.

Things to Consider
What to Expect from Online Couples Counseling
How much does it cost? Counseling services can range from $75 to $450 per session or more. Some companies offer subscriptions for less than $500 per month.
Who is it for? Couples, people in relationships, and individuals who want to work on their relationships independently.
Will insurance cover it? Usually, couples therapy is not covered by insurance, but this also depends on the company and whether one of the people in couples therapy has a mental health diagnosis that is being treated.
How do we meet? Many online couples therapy companies offer weekly sessions via video chat, phone, or text. In many cases, you and your partner can join the session from different devices.
Is it confidential? Be sure to read through any company's privacy policy to better understand whether it is HIPAA-compliant (HIPAA is the law that protects personal health information) and whether it shares any private information with third parties; we recommend opting out of data collection.
What's the time commitment? You and your partner might find that you can work out your issues in a number of weeks, while other couples might need months or even years in therapy. As for how long you'll spend in each session, the companies on this list offer sessions from 30 to 50 minutes each. 
Does it work? Couples therapy, even online couples therapy in particular, has been proven effective, but you'll only get out what you put in. If you come to therapy ready to do the work, you're more likely to see success.
How I Review Online Therapy Services

I've spent three years testing and surveying real therapy users and reviewing their experiences to help rate and share the best online therapy services. You can see a full breakdown of our online therapy research and testing process on Verywell Mind, but here is an overview of how I capture and evaluate firsthand experience and survey data.

Firsthand Experience

I had 65 different people sign up for talk therapy with all 55 online therapy companies reviewed. Over the past three years, I've published 153 reviews (here are our reviews for BetterHelp and Talkspace, for instance). I had my testers try out each company's therapy services, and if the company offered other services (like couples therapy and kid or teen therapy) we tested those too. 

I asked each tester to try each service for at least a month, which usually meant between two and six sessions at each company. I also asked testers to switch therapists partway through, if possible, in order to get a holistic idea of the offerings and quality of each company. My testers were located all across the United States and abroad, meaning I gained extensive information about each company's services in a variety of areas.

User Surveys

I surveyed more than 8,000 therapy clients who are currently using one of the 55 online therapy companies tested or who had used one in the recent past. I collected 350 different data points in which I asked users to evaluate each company's services, from their therapist's qualifications to whether they found a therapist who met all their needs to how they'd rate the company overall.

How Do You Know If You Need Couples Therapy?

If you are having trouble communicating with your partner, if you find yourselves fighting a lot, or if you are disagreeing about important aspects of your lives, these are all great reasons to try out couples therapy. Working with a couples therapist can help strengthen your relationship by improving the way you talk to and interact with each other, practicing better ways of solving problems, and really delving into the issues that are repeatedly arising in the relationship. 

But couples therapy isn't just for people whose relationships are on the rocks. Going to couples therapy can help even the strongest of couples understand each other better and get ahead of problems that might crop up down the road. It's a great way to practice good communication and make sure that you and your partner are doing-and will continue to do-the best things for your relationship.

Paying for Online Couples Therapy

Some online therapy companies who provide couples therapy operate as subscriptions-you pay a certain amount monthly for a certain number of sessions in that month. Other companies are pay-per-session. The amount you pay might be fixed, or might differ depending on your location or the qualifications of your therapist.

It's important to note that couples therapy is generally not covered by insurance, because it is usually not considered a necessary service. However, if one or both of you have a diagnosed mental health condition, you might be able to use your insurance to pay for your online couples therapy sessions.
