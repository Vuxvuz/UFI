How to Overcome Feelings Of 'Being Behind in Life'

Your peers are discussing how well-funded their 401Ks are, your in-law is bragging about her booming business venture, and your best friends just bought a house and have a baby on the way. All these exciting milestones are worthy of celebration-and you want to be happy for everyone-but there's that little voice in the back of your mind that says, "Why am I not there yet?"

Feeling behind in life is a common experience, and one that most people have at least a handful of times throughout their lives. But here's the thing: timelines aren't one-size-fits-all. Here, we'll explore why feelings of being "behind" are often rooted in unrealistic expectations and self-created pressure. We'll also offer some tips on how to shift your mindset, redefine success on your own terms, and gain a new appreciation for your unique path. 

Why It's So Easy to Feel Behind

Feeling behind in life can sneak up on you in all sorts of moments-while scrolling through social media, enjoying a dinner with family or friends, or even just lying awake at night wondering if you took a wrong turn somewhere.

"Humans are naturally inclined to compare themselves to others due to both evolutionary and social factors. Historically, comparison helped individuals assess their social standing, a crucial element for survival," says Carolina Casillas, PhD, LPC, a therapist at the Clinical Mental Health Counseling Faculty at University of Phoenix. 

In today's modern world, that comparison is amplified by societal pressures, but also through social media "highlight reels." At any hour of the day, we're exposed to a carefully curated display of others' wins with little context for what else is going on in their life or the struggles they may have endured to find their own successes. 

Negative Impacts of Excessive Comparison

While comparing ourselves to others can sometimes have a positive effect-leading to motivation or goal-setting-it more often chips away at our self-worth. This is especially true when we use someone else's timeline as the measure of our own progress.

"Unhealthy comparison leads to distorted perceptions of success and makes people question where they're at," says Ashley Rudolph, a leadership coach and founder of The Operator's Edge. "This can be emotionally costly. I've seen it result in things like erosion of self-worth, resentment in relationships, and difficulty recognizing or being satisfied with your own progress." 

She adds that she's even worked with clients who've secured significant raises for themselves or landed dream jobs, yet still feel behind because someone else's post made them question their pace.

"I've also seen the comparisons result in things like going into debt to keep up or feeling like you have to compromise your values or morals," Rudolph says. "These are both signals that you may have crossed a line and need to check in with yourself." Studies have also found that excessive comparison can lead to feelings of anxiety and depression,1and can take a notable toll on our self-esteem.2 These have compounding effects as we move through life.

How to Overcome Feelings Of 'Being Behind in Life'

No matter the category, it's easy to feel like you're falling short when you measure your journey against someone else's successes, but those feelings don't have to define your reality. Here are some strategies you can try to overcome those awful "can't catch up!" emotions. 

Understand That Everyone Is On Their Own Path 

Comparison is often a knee-jerk reaction we experience when we see another person's wins. In these moments, you must remind yourself that there is no singular right timeline or journey to follow in life. 

"Everyone is wired differently and meant to follow a unique trajectory," says psychotherapist Stevie Blum. "When we're younger, most people are on the same path, more or less. After college graduation, paths begin to diverge and the disparities in income, relationship status, and life choices become much more pronounced. This can be extremely challenging to navigate as comparison and self-doubt creep in." 

Just because someone else is hitting certain milestones doesn't mean you're behind; it simply means your story is unfolding in its own way. Trusting your individual timeline and staying grounded in your values can help you focus less on where others are going and more on what truly feels right for you.

Use Jealousy as a Tool 

Jealousy, while a very painful emotion to experience, can be an extremely valuable tool. Blum says, "Jealousy shows you what you want in life and also what's possible. Instead of trying to suppress jealousy or judging yourself for feeling it, get curious instead." 

Ask yourself: What does this reveal about my deepest desires? How can I go about achieving this for myself? Turn the energy spent comparing and feeling inadequate into positive action. Use jealousy as a tool to help you set new goals, learn to appreciate what you already have, or work on your self-confidence. It's important to appreciate what you have while working towards what you want simultaneously.

Deeply Examine Your Feelings 

What you're feeling might seem like jealousy on the surface, but it's also worth asking if that's really what's going on. Sometimes, what we label as envy is actually grief over a missed opportunity, frustration from feeling stuck, or longing for a life that feels more aligned with who we are. Rudolphy says that by getting curious instead of judgmental, you can uncover what's really driving your emotions and use that insight as a compass rather than a weight. 

Practice Self-Compassion 

It is essential that feelings of "being behind in life" are met with a sense of self-compassion versus self-criticism. "The line is crossed when an individual perceives themselves as permanently inadequate or believes they will never 'catch up' rather than viewing the feeling as a temporary challenge to overcome," Casillas says. 

Practicing self-compassion allows you to acknowledge your emotions without letting them spiral into shame or hopelessness. Research also consistently shows that self-compassion is strongly linked to greater emotional well-being, including higher levels of happiness and optimism and lower levels of anxiety and depression.3

Define and Prioritize Your Own Goals 

One of the fastest ways to feel like you're falling behind is by chasing goals that were never yours to begin with. Social expectations, family pressure, and curated glimpses into other people's lives can all blur the line between what you truly want and what you think you should want. That's why it's essential to pause and define success on your own terms.

"Redefine what 'having it together' means to you. Not in theory, but in practice," says Rudolph. "Is it being financially stable enough to take a risk? Is it having a few people in your corner who really get you? Is it finding a new job?"

Once you've clarified what actually matters to you, you can start prioritizing your time and energy around those goals-rather than trying to keep pace with someone else's journey. There's real power in choosing intention over imitation.
