Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a mental health issue that involves a dread of social situations including performing or speaking in front of others for fear of being negatively judged. According to mental health experts, SAD impacts 7% of the U.S. population.1 Moreover, the United States Preventative Services Task Force recommends that adults under the of age 65 get regular screenings for anxiety.2

Although it's common for many people to experience nervousness or feel "butterflies" when facing certain social situations, people with SAD are extremely self-conscious and worry about what people think to the point that they often experience physical symptoms. These may include a rapid heart rate, sweating, blushing, nausea, shaking, and lightheadedness.

People with SAD often benefit from psychotherapy techniques, such as cognitive behavioral therapy. Medication is also recommended to help cope and take control of the situation.
