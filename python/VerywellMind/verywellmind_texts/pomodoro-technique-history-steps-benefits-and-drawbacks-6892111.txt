Do you ever struggle to stay focused and get tasks done? If so, you might want to try the Pomodoro Technique, a time management tool that involves splitting work tasks into 25-minute intervals, known as pomodoros, with breaks scheduled in between each interval.1

Getting something done on time and ticking it off your to-do list can be extremely satisfying. However, it can sometimes be hard to get things done if you're having trouble managing your time or feeling overwhelmed by the amount of work you have to do. In that case, it may be helpful to use a time management technique to help you get started and manage your time more efficiently.

First introduced in the 1980s, the Pomodoro technique has gained greater popularity in recent years thanks to its ability to help stave off burnout. Combining short bursts of focused work with brief breaks allows people to get more done without losing concentration or getting overwhelmed.

Keep reading to learn more about how the Pomodoro Technique was developed, how you can practice it, and the benefits and drawbacks it offers.

How to Practice the Pomodoro Technique

Here's how to practice the Pomodoro technique:

Select your task.
Set a 25-minute timer.
Work on the task until the timer goes off.
Take a 5-minute break.
Repeat this format.
Take a longer 15- to 30-minute break every four pomodoro intervals.

These are some tips that can help you implement the Pomodoro technique:2

Use a Timer

Using a timer can help ensure you stay on track and don't overshoot your intervals. You can use an old-fashioned kitchen timer to set an alarm for every pomodoro interval and break. Or, you can use a timer app on your phone if you prefer. If you're working on your computer, some browsers also have pomodoro timer extensions.

Plan Your Tasks

It can be helpful to plan out your tasks for the day and estimate how many pomodoro intervals you need for each task. Split complex tasks on your to-do lists into smaller chunks so that you can easily divide them into pomodoro intervals.

Make the Most of Your Breaks

Use your breaks to sip on water, nibble on a snack, stretch your limbs, do a quick meditation, or take a short walk. These activities can help you feel refreshed so that you're ready to get back to work again after the break.

Customize the Intervals

If you've tried the Pomodoro technique and feel that the 25-minute pomodoro intervals or 5-minute breaks are not working for you, you can adjust the timings to suit you better. The idea is essentially to set out chunks of time to focus on work and take breaks in between to relax your mind and refresh yourself. Timers with customized intervals and breaks are sometimes referred to as marinara timers.3

How the Pomodoro Technique Was Developed

You're probably wondering how this technique was developed and why the intervals of time are measured in units of tomatoes. The Pomodoro technique was developed in 1987 by Francesco Cirillo, who explains how it came about on his website.4

As a university student studying for exams, Cirillo found himself struggling to focus on his books. He used a kitchen timer shaped like a tomato (known as "pomodoro" in Italian) to set a 2-minute timer for himself and challenged himself to stay focused for just two minutes.

When it worked, he set the timer for a longer interval and found that it helped him stay focused on his task. He experimented with different interval periods and found that 25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute break was ideal. 10-minute intervals were too short to get anything done and hour-long intervals without a break were too long.

In developing the technique, Cirillo's motivation was to use time effectively and turn it into an ally, rather than thinking of it as a vicious predator that was to be feared and avoided.4

Benefits of the Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro technique aims to work with your brain, not against it. By balancing effort with regular breaks, this approach has a number of benefits that can potentially improve productivity and focus while reducing the risk of boredom and burnout.

Here are a few of the key reasons why people swear by this technique:5

Encourages focused work: Demarcating a period of time only for work can help you stay focused on your task and prevent you from getting distracted by other things, such as checking your social media, unloading the dishwasher, or switching to a different task.
Helps you get started: Sometimes, if you have a lot of work to do, it can feel overwhelming, and you may not know where to begin. The Pomodoro technique helps you get organized by breaking tasks down into smaller, more manageable chunks that you can tackle one at a time.
Improves efficiency: If you tend to procrastinate or get easily distracted, the Pomodoro Technique can help you manage your time better by making you accountable to yourself. It can help you use your time more efficiently and accomplish your goals.
Reduces stress and anxiety: If you have a deadline approaching, time can sometimes feel like the enemy and cause you to experience stress and anxiety. Having a framework to manage your time can help you feel more in control and reduce your stress and anxiety.

Researchers suggest that this strategy may be helpful for remote workers as a way to reduce stress and stay focused while working at home.6

One study also found that people with ADHD and learning disabilities may find the technique helpful for dealing with specific challenges, such as difficulty initiating tasks and maintaining focus.7

Drawbacks of the Pomodoro Technique

While the Pomodoro technique can be helpful, that doesn't mean that it is right for every person in every situation. Some potential drawbacks can include:8

The fixed intervals and breaks can sometimes feel a little *too* rigid and regimented.
It can be stressful if the task takes longer than the stipulated interval.
If your task gets over before the interval, you may find yourself wondering what to do. 
The framework doesn't account for interruptions beyond your control. For instance, there may be other tasks or colleagues that demand your attention at work.
Takeaways

If you're looking for a time management strategy to help you be more productive and make the most of your workday, it's worth trying the Pomodoro Technique to see if it works for you. You can try the 25-minute intervals with 5-minute breaks, or customize the intervals to suit your needs.
