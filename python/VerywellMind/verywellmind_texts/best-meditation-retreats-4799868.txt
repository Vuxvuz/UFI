Meditation practitioners and researchers agree that meditation can help reduce stress, improve mental and physical well-being, and calm the mind and body. It does this by triggering the body's relaxation response and quieting the stress-induced thoughts that can cause a state of agitation.

For some, a quiet room in the house or a peaceful spot in the park can be enough to serve as a place to practice mindful meditation. But others may need more guidance with yoga classes or workshops, and a calm respite from their bustling cities and busy households with soothing, inspiring views and luxurious amenities. Meditation retreats offer these and more. Here, we've rounded up the best meditation retreats in the country.

Guide to Choosing the Best Meditation Retreats
Are Meditation Retreats Worth It?

The benefits of practicing mindful meditation are numerous. According to research, it can help reduce cortisol (the stress hormone) levels, lower heart rate, and decrease blood pressure-all of which are physiological signs of stress.1

Whether you're looking to get started with the practice of meditation or want more in-depth instruction, meditation retreats can be a great way to de-stress and recharge while learning techniques you can use in your daily life.

Meditation retreats are not necessary. Some may find that visiting a local meditation center or following a meditation video or meditation app at home may be a sufficient way to practice meditation. But if you're looking to disconnect from a busy household, take a break from your job, or reenergize in a beautifully inspiring location, you might find a meditation retreat a unique and memorable experience.

Some meditation retreats offer luxurious amenities-hot spring baths, vegan or vegetarian cuisine, guided hikes or eco-tours, yoga classes, spas, and massages-in a gorgeous setting. Others offer more spartan accommodations but provide opportunities to connect with nature or a community of practitioners. Some also offer workshops led by experienced instructors and teachers that can offer you the guidance you need. 

Best Guided Meditations
Comparing Meditation Retreats

Booking a meditation retreat can be as complicated as booking your next vacation. Here are a few things to consider before deciding on a meditation retreat.

Location: Many retreat sites are located in more remote areas (the better to provide the peace and quiet you need), so you may need to travel by plane. Think about whether you're willing to travel far for a meditation retreat or would rather stay closer to home.
Cost: Rates for meditation retreats can vary depending on the type of accommodations or length of stay. Consider how much you're willing to spend, especially if you'll mostly be spending time in workshops or sessions.
Type of classes, instructors: Research the site's programs and see if they suit your needs and experience level.
Activities and scenery: Some meditation retreats offer activities outside of meditation workshops or instruction, such as massages, hikes, or other outdoor activities. If you want to combine recreation with meditation, consider places that offer these extras. And if you're looking to be inspired by your scenery, consider coastal locations or mountain destinations.
Embarking on Your Meditation Journey

Once you've decided on a meditation retreat, check out the location's website to book early. Most programs fill quickly and may require early registration. Keep this in mind, especially if you're looking to work with a specific instructor or teacher. Once you've booked, confirm what you need to bring, and keep in mind that some retreats have spotty cell reception. But most of all, relax and enjoy your stay and try to eliminate distractions so you can truly practice mindful meditation.
