Who Is This Quiz For?

This quiz is for anyone who's experiencing midlife and wondering if they're having a full-blown midlife crisis. Midlife is generally considered to be the period between the ages of 40 and 60, plus or minus 10 years.1 Situated between youth and old age, this period can feel a little vague and undefined.2

This quiz can help you put a finger on any feelings of discontent, uncertainty, or anxiety you're experiencing about your middle years.

Moreover, it can help you determine whether it might be time to make some changes to your life or routine. It can also help you identify whether you might need support from friends, family, or a mental healthcare professional.

How to Be More Mature
The Importance of a Positive Mindset

Maintaining a positive mindset is key to navigating the feelings of insecurity and uncertainty that can accompany a midlife crisis. 

While a midlife crisis can be a challenging and tumultuous time, it can also serve as a catalyst for personal growth, transformation, and a renewed purpose in life.

- SERGIO MURIEL, LMHC, CAP

A positive mindset can help you:

Embrace change: It's important to recognize that change is a natural part of life. Instead of resisting it, a positive mindset can help you embrace it as an opportunity for personal growth and transformation.
Practice gratitude: Cultivate a sense of gratitude for the positive aspects of your life, such as relationships, achievements, and experiences. 
Stay flexible: Keep an open mind to trying new things and exploring different paths.
Find your purpose: Explore activities, hobbies, or volunteer opportunities that bring meaning and purpose to your life.
Avoid comparisons: Avoid comparing yourself to others and be grateful for what you have instead. Remember that perfection is a mirage; everyone's life has their unique pros and cons.
