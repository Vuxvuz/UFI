Stress affects everybody, but not all of us respond to it in the same way. The stress-vulnerability model, also known as the diathesis-stress model, helps explain why some people are more susceptible to mental health ailments. The model was developed in 1977 by Zubin and Spring to explain the development of schizophrenia.

After its initial introduction to the mental health world, the model extended to include a broad range of psychiatric diagnoses.1 There is no simple explanation for why mental illness happens. That's because, in most cases, there are many factors that play a role. The vulnerability-stress model helps researchers and mental health practitioners understand how genetics and stress intersect to affect a person's risk of experiencing mental health problems.

Keep reading to learn more about the vulnerability- stress model, some criticism it has received, the impact stress can have on us, and ways to boost protective factors to fight against stress.

How the Stress-Vulnerability Model Works

The stress-vulnerability model suggests that the risk of developing a psychiatric disorder comes down to two big factors: biological vulnerability and stress. But there is good news, too. Protective factors-like a strong social support system, self-care, and healthy coping strategies-can help dial down both biological vulnerability and stress.

Elements of the Stress-Vulnerability Model
Biological Vulnerability

Protective Factors
Biological Vulnerability

Biological vulnerability refers to one's genetic predisposition. For example, bipolar disorder is known to have a genetic link and is often passed down in families.2

Biological vulnerability also accounts for experiences that could have occurred in the womb or as a baby.1

Stress

While stress can contribute to developing a mental health disorder, it isn't the only factor at play. For example, someone may already have a genetic predisposition to a mental health disorder, but they have not developed it yet.

If a person is genetically predisposed to a mental health condition, a major life event or a series of stressful events can trigger the onset of a mental health disorder.

Examples of these life stressors include:3

Life crises (e.g., death of a loved one, major illness)
Substance use
Personal and job-related stressors

When this significant life crisis occurs, some of the disorder's symptoms can emerge. However, remember that the probability of this depends on the type of psychiatric condition the person is predisposed to.1

Protective Factors

Protective factors are critical for keeping stress and biological vulnerability in check. Think of them as your mental health safety net. Such factors can include:1

Having a solid support system-people who listen, communicate well, and have your back
Following a structured daily routine-consistent habits are important for mental health
Keeping stress levels low(ish)-while it's sometimes easier said than done, setting boundaries to help keep the chaos to a minimum can go a long way toward protecting your peace

Epigenetics

Another element of the stress vulnerability model is called epigenetics.

Epigenetics speaks to how our environment, behaviors, and lifestyle can change our genes.

These changes begin before you are even born, meaning you are impacted by the environment, behaviors, and lifestyles of your lineage. However, your epigenetics also change throughout your life. This is positive because it indicates that some epigenetic changes can be reversed.

A simple example of this is how some former smokers can reach the same DNA methylation as non-smokers.4 Again, this is more evidence that we aren't destined to be vulnerable simply based on our gene expression.

Generational Trauma

Epigenetics is also a component of generational trauma. For example, some of the stress experienced during a mother's pregnancy will then influence the baby's gene expression. This can lead to strengths and vulnerabilities.5 There is also research indicating that epigenetics can expand across multiple generations, with some pivotal research specifically focusing on generational trauma resulting from structural racism creating adverse health outcomes in the Black community.6

Again, it is important to remember that gene expressions can be shifted. Just because we experienced stress while in utero or because we have come from an oppressed lineage does not mean we are destined to be sick.7 Protective factors are immensely helpful in ensuring that we are not limited based on our genes.

How to Boost Protective Factors

Decreasing stress is a great way to minimize your vulnerability to developing severe ailments. However, this may seem challenging while living in an already complicated world. Rather than solely focusing on reducing stress, let's consider how you can build upon your protective factors:

Assess your current points of stress and take a look at your community resources. For example, if food insecurity is a stressor, does your community offer any discounted or free food provisions? If you're not sure, take a look at any community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs. These programs will sometimes offer weekly boxes of fresh fruits and vegetables at a steeply discounted price.
What is your support system like? If you're looking around and feeling under-supported by others, it may be worth looking into a support or therapy group. Both of these offer the opportunity to build closeness and community with others while focusing on your healing.
Do you have any hobbies or talents? Perhaps you love creating art and find it to be a strong emotional outlet. Also, running might be a source of stress relief. Regardless of what your chosen hobby is, see how you can lean into it to support yourself.

Criticism of the Stress-Vulnerability Model

While the Stress-Vulnerability Model has been instrumental in helping us better understand psychiatric ailments, it hasn't been without its critics.

The Term 'Vulnerability' Is Limiting

A 2022 article published in Frontiers in Sociology found the model's focus on vulnerability to be disempowering. Noting the nearly 50 years that have passed since the model was introduced, the article found the model's emphasis on vulnerability to be a distraction from the actual harm at hand.1

For example, if one's form of stress is abuse at the hands of caregivers, simply removing the caregivers will not solve the issue of stress as a key vulnerability. Instead, there must be support from individuals who understand the needs of someone who has experienced abuse.1

Takeaways

We all experience different types of stress throughout our lives, but the lingering impact it has on our health and well-being can vary depending on things like our biological vulnerabilities and coping mechanisms. Some people are more susceptible, which is why it's important to take steps to manage your stress and get the support you need.

If you're experiencing stress or trauma, please know that you are not alone. A mental health professional can help support you in your healing process.
