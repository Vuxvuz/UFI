An eating disorder is a mental health condition in which the person affected experiences significant disruptions in their eating behaviors as well as in their thoughts and emotions related to food. People who struggle with eating disorders often become preoccupied with food and their body weight. These conditions can be life-threatening if left untreated.

Additionally, eating disorders often occur together with other mental health issues like depression, anxiety, panic disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Without treatment, eating disorders can cause a number of health-related problems including cardiovascular issues, gastrointestinal issues, and malnutrition. However, with proper treatment, people affected by eating disorders can resume health eating habits and can improve their mental health.
