Race and Social Justice

Race is everywhere. It plays an important role in our identity and shapes our perspectives including how we think and feel about mental health. There are many mental health considerations unique to certain racial and cultural groups. The stigmatization of bisexual men, the strong Black women stereotype, and the lack of mental health services for Indigenous communities. These are just a few examples of how race and culture align with mental health and wellness. Learn more about the relationship between your identity, your racial group, and your mental health here.

What is the concept of race?

The dictionary by Merriam-Webster defines race as "a category of humankind that shares certain distinctive physical traits."1

Race is usually associated with biology and linked with physical characteristics, such as hair texture or skin color, and covers a relatively narrow range of options. Yet people of similar complexions/hair textures can be defined as different races, and definitions in the United States have changed over time.

What are the six categories of race?

When completing paperwork that asks for race, you may be asked to identify yourself as belonging to one or more of the following categories:

White
Black or African American
Asian
American Indian or Alaska Native
Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander
Some other race

While some may be considered to be of a certain race, Black people, for example, may identify more with their individual ethnicity, as opposed to race. This could apply to any member of any race.

Why is it important to learn about race and ethnicity?

Conversations about race and ethnicity are key to building empathy, facilitating acceptance, understanding, and respect for those with people from other backgrounds. Such histories of other cultures and races are often erased or minimized from mainstream narratives, so it is essential to learn about the struggles and experiences of marginalized groups.
