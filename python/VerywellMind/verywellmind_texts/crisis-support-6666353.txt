988
Suicide Risk

The crisis counselor you connect with will ask you why you are calling or texting and assess your risk of suicide.

If You Are At Risk of Suicide

If the counselor determines that you are at imminent risk of suicide (or in the process of committing suicide), a list of best practices will be employed to handle the situation. Crisis counselors are there to help people work through a suicidal episode until they feel more stable, as well as to provide them with the resources they need moving forward.

If You Are Not At Risk of Suicide

If the crisis counselor concludes that you are not at imminent risk of suicide (i.e. you don't have a plan/means/intent to complete suicide within the next 24 hours), they will attempt to de-escalate you and provide you with follow-up services, such as how to find follow-up care in your area.
