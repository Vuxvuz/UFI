How Our Review Board Process Works

Every article created by our team of expert writers that contains verifiable facts or medical information makes its way through our comprehensive Review Board process and gets assigned to a specialist based on their area of expertise. Even our custom illustrations go through the Review Board.

When you see this check mark on a Verywell Mind article, you can trust it meets the high standards of our Review Board.

The Verywell Mind Review Board members confirm each piece of content they review is up-to-date, thorough, and authoritative-containing facts and guidelines that reflect the latest in mental health research and health information, as well as compassionate advice to help you feel your best.

If the Review Board suggests improvements, those are shared directly with our editorial staff so our editors can make any changes needed. Once a piece of content is approved, it receives the Review Board stamp in the byline-and you'll know exactly who reviewed it and when.
