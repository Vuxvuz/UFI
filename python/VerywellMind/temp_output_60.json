    "content": "1. Savasana can improve depression symptoms by reducing cortisol levels and promoting relaxation in individuals with anxiety disorders. A small study looked at the effects of practicing savasana on 30 patients with depression in India. On average, the patients' depression scores were significantly lower after savasana. 2. Floor time activates the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), which counters the stress response and promotes relaxation. When you're stressed or anxious, your body is in a state of 'fight or flight.' The PNS helps you relax, recover, and repair. 3. Mindfulness practices have been shown to improve symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. While floor time might not be a traditional mindfulness practice, it allows for a natural, effortless connection with the breath, body, and present moment. References:    Kamal, Y. (2020).

That's where accommodations and modifications come in.\n\n*   If lying on your back isn't for you, try lying on your side.\n*   If your lower back gets sore, try raising your knees while keeping your feet on the ground, hip-distance apart.\n*   Kamal and Benzaken recommend placing a prop-like a bolster, folded blanket, or blocks-underneath your knees.  - **Final Thoughts: Is Floor Time Worth Trying?**\n\nFloor time is one of the simplest, zero-cost wellness trends to emerge on TikTok, and its benefits for relaxation, mindfulness, and spinal health make it worth incorporating into your routine.\n\n*   Whether you try it for five minutes after work or use it as part of a bedtime ritual, floor time is an easy, no-pressure way to give your mind and body a break.\n*   So, next time you're feeling overwhelmed, try lying on the floor and see how it makes you feel. Sometimes, the simplest habits have the biggest impact.  - **References**\n\n1.

    "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/smart-goals-for-lifestyle-change-2224097",
    "content": "How SMART goals work in therapy The SMART goal template is often used in therapy settings, especially when working with patients who struggle with motivation or reaching their mental health goals. Your therapist may ask you to use the SMART goal framework as a way of breaking down large goals into smaller steps that are achievable and measurable. Using SMART Goals in Therapy A therapist will work with you to create specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals for your therapy sessions. This helps ensure progress toward recovery is happening regularly. The goal can be tailored based on the individual's needs and may involve a combination of the following: 1. Identifying and challenging negative thoughts patterns or behaviors that are causing distress 2. Learning new coping strategies to manage anxiety, depression, or other mental health concerns 3. Improving communication skills with family members or friends 4. Building self-esteem through positive affirmations and self-care activities 5. Setting boundaries in relationships to promote healthy emotional regulation When you create SMART goals with your therapist, it's essential to remember that they are not one-size-fits-all solutions. You work together to develop a plan tailored to your unique needs and circumstances. Using SMART Goals Outside of Therapy While setting SMART goals can be beneficial for anyone, using them in therapy can provide an added layer of support and accountability. If you're working on your mental health independently, you may still find it helpful to create SMART goals as a way to stay motivated and track progress. This template is useful for breaking down larger objectives into smaller steps that are achievable and measurable. Using the SMART goal framework can help you identify what specific actions need to be taken to achieve your goals and provide a clear roadmap for success. If you're struggling with anxiety, depression, or other mental health concerns, consider using SMART goals as part of your treatment plan or in conjunction with therapy. Next Steps in The End of the Resolution Guide 1\\. Understand how SMART goals can help you define changes you want to make in your life and come up with a plan to achieve them. 2\\. Use the SMART goal template to break down large goals into smaller, achievable steps. 3\\. Identify what specific actions need to be taken to achieve your goals and create a clear roadmap for success. 4\\. Track progress and review results regularly to make adjustments as needed. 5\\. Consider using SMART goals in therapy or on your own to stay motivated and achieve your mental health goals.\n\n**How to Set SMART Goals**\n\nSetting SMART goals can help you define changes you want to make in your life and come up with a plan to achieve them.\n\n*   A goal is specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.\n*   Using the SMART goal framework can help you identify what specific actions need to be taken to achieve your goals and provide a clear roadmap for success.\n\n**SMART Goal Types**\n\nThere are different types of goals that may work better than others. For example:\n\n1\\. Approach goals tend to be more effective than avoidance goals.\n\n2\\. Performance goals may be less effective than mastery goals.\n\n**How to Set SMART Goals**\n\nYou can set SMART goals on your own or use them in therapy. Here's a template you can use to define your SMART goal:\n\n*   I will [your goal here] by [how you will do the goal].\n*   I will know I am making progress because [how you will measure the goal] for [time goes here].\n\n**Tips For Goal Setting**\n\nHere are some tips that will help make your SMART goals stick:\n\n1\\. Write your goal down and go back to it often.\n\n2\\. Keep in mind that life happens. Making adjustments to your goal is part of the learning process.\n\n3\\. Don't beat yourself up if something has to change.\n\n4\\. Be realistic about your expectations.\n\n5\\. Focus on process goals instead of just the outcome.\n\n6\\. Think about changing behaviors and habits.\n\n7\\. Remember that someone else's goals are not your goals. Your goals have to be meaningful and attainable for you.\n\n**Using SMART Goals in Therapy**\n\nA therapist may ask you to use the SMART goal framework as a way of breaking down large goals into smaller steps that are achievable and measurable.

It can interfere with a person's ability to live their life and cause significant distress. The symptoms of atelophobia include:\n\n*   Having unrealistic goals\n*   Judging oneself harshly for not meeting those goals\n*   Being unable to accept feedback\n*   Experiencing fear and anxiety when faced with situations where mistakes might be made\n\nThe causes of atelophobia can vary, but may include trauma, upbringing, genetic factors, or toxic situations. It is classified as a specific phobia, an intense, irrational fear of something that doesn't pose any threat.\n\nAtelophobia is not the same as perfectionism. While both conditions involve striving for flawlessness, atelophobia is driven by a fear of failure and can be debilitating. Treatment for atelophobia typically involves therapy, such as exposure therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), or mindfulness-based interventions, and in some cases, medication.\n\nCoping strategies for atelophobia include getting used to making mistakes, finding ways to calm oneself, leaving toxic situations, and building a support system. If you are experiencing symptoms of atelophobia, it is recommended that you seek evaluation by a mental health professional who specializes in treating anxiety disorders. \n\nReferences:   1.  \"Perfectionism.\" The Perfectionist's Guide to Letting Go.

It can interfere with a person's ability to live their life and cause significant distress. The symptoms of atelophobia include:\n\n*   Having unrealistic goals\n*   Judging oneself harshly for not meeting those goals\n*   Being unable to accept feedback\n*   Experiencing fear and anxiety when faced with situations where mistakes might be made\n\nThe causes of atelophobia can vary, but may include trauma, upbringing, genetic factors, or toxic situations. It is classified as a specific phobia, an intense, irrational fear of something that doesn't pose any threat.\n\nAtelophobia is not the same as perfectionism",
