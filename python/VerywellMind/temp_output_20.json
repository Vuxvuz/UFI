For example, practicing everyday mindfulness can:\n\n1.  Pull you out of the negative downward spiral caused by too much daily stress, too many bad moods, or the habit of rumination.\n2.

Schedule time each day to practice meditation or yoga.\n2.  Focus on your breathing when you're upset or anxious.\n3.  Practice progressive muscle relaxation by tensing and relaxing your muscles one group at a time.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMindfulness takes practice and effort, but with patience and persistence, it can lead to numerous benefits, including decreased stress, better mental health, better relationships, and greater overall happiness.

Please consult a qualified healthcare professional with any questions you may have regarding your specific condition. If you are experiencing symptoms or need mental health support, please contact a trusted healthcare provider or crisis hotline.\n\n**Bipolar Disorder**\n \n**Overview**\n\nBipolar disorder is a mental health condition defined by periods (or episodes) of extreme mood disturbances that affect mood, thoughts, and behavior. There are two main types of bipolar disorders: Bipolar I disorder involves episodes of severe mania and often depression, while Bipolar II disorder involves a less severe form of mania called hypomania.\n\n*   Around 4.4% of U.S. adults will have bipolar disorder at some point in their lives.\n*   Genetics are thought to play a significant role, although brain abnormalities and environmental factors also contribute as causes of bipolar disorder.\n*   Mood stabilizers are usually the first-line treatment, but electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be used to address severe symptoms.\n\n**Living with Bipolar Disorder**\n\n*   People who have cyclothymic disorder may have a higher risk for later developing bipolar disorder.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\n1.  Only a doctor or qualified mental health professional can diagnose you with bipolar disorder.\n2.  You may want to see your doctor if you are experiencing symptoms of mania, depression, or both.\n3.  Symptoms of mania can include talking excessively, racing thoughts, decreased sleep, and delusions.\n4.  Symptoms of depression may include fatigue, prolonged sadness, and loss of interest in activities.\n\n**Treatment**\n\n*   Bipolar disorder is typically treated with medications and sometimes electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), therapy, and psychoeducation.\n*   Common medications include mood stabilizers or anticonvulsants, as well as second or third generation antipsychotics.\n*   Antidepressants are typically avoided if possible due to risks including mania and rapid cycling.\n\n**Understanding Bipolar Disorder**\n\n*   There is a strong genetic component in bipolar disorder.\n*   Twin studies have found that when one identical twin has the condition, the likelihood that their twin sibling will also have it is around 40%.\n*   While there is a genetic vulnerability, inherited factors interact with environmental influences that can play a role in triggering the disorder's onset.\n\n**Key Terms**\n\n1.  Bipolar I Disorder: This type of bipolar disorder involves the presence of at least one manic episode.\n2.  Bipolar II Disorder: This type of bipolar disorder is marked by periods of depressive and hypomanic episodes without periods of full-blown mania.\n3.  Cyclothymic Disorder: This condition, also known as cyclothymia, is marked by periods of cycling between hypomania and depressive symptoms.\n\n**Exploring Bipolar Disorder**\n\n*   Over one-third of psychiatric patients are misdiagnosed.\n*   Understanding the causes may help scientists develop ways to prevent or treat the condition.\n*   Research suggests that around 4.4% of U.S. adults will have bipolar disorder at some point in their lives.\n\n**Sources**\n\n1.  \"Bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, and cyclothymic disorder.\" American Psychiatric Association, psychiatry.org, 2023.\n2.  \"Prevalence of Bipolar Disorder in U.S. Adults\" Journal of Clinical Psychology (2020) Vol. 76(4): p. 1035–1047.\n3.  \"Bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, and cyclothymic disorder.\" American Psychiatric Association, psychiatry.org, 2023.\n\n**Daniel B.

    "content": "with Us How to Use Progressive Muscle Relaxation\n \n**Title**\nUse Guided Imagery For Relaxation\n\n**Overview**\nGuided imagery is a mind-body intervention that involves evoking positive mental imagery to help invoke a positive effect. This relaxation technique can be helpful for calming the body, relieving stress, and combatting feelings of anxiety.\n\n*   It can quickly calm your body and simultaneously relax your mind.\n*   It's pleasant to practice and not overly difficult or intimidating to learn.\n*   It can help you de-stress in minutes and can also be a useful strategy for maintaining resilience toward stress during difficult times.\n\n**How to Practice Guided Imagery**\n\n1.  Get Comfortable\n2.  Breathe From Your Belly\n3.  Vividly Imagine Your Scene\n\n    *   Once you are in a relaxed state, begin to envision yourself in the most relaxing environment you can imagine.\n    *   The key is to find what works for you.\n    *   For some, this would be floating in the cool, clear waters of a remote tropical island, where attractive people bring drinks and smooth music plays in the background.\n    *   For others, this might be sitting by a fire in a snow cabin, deep in the woods, sipping hot cocoa, and reading the latest bestseller.\n\n**Where to Learn Guided Imagery**\n\n*   Taking a class where you are guided by an instructor\n*   Using audio recordings, creating your own recordings\n*   Using your inner voice and imagination\n\n**The Effects of Guided Imagery**\n\nResearch suggests that guided imagery can increase alpha brain waves, which are associated with a relaxed, enhanced mood. When stressed, alpha waves tend to decrease, which is connected to a heightened state of alertness and anxiety.\n\n**How It Works**\n\n1.  Envisioning a relaxing scene in great detail relating to all of the senses.\n2.  The scene envisioned in guided imagery can be something in the natural world, like a beautiful waterfall in Hawaii or a cool and dense forest where you may take a calming walk in your imagination.\n3.  Imagining a wise 'guide' with them, answering their questions and asking them questions to ponder.\n\n**The Benefits of Guided Imagery**\n\n*   Relaxation\n*   Insight\n*   Wisdom\n*   Relieving physical tension and psychological stress at the same time\n\n**Potential Pitfalls and Limitations**\n\n1.  Mastering autonomous guided imagery can take some practice.\n2.  Working with a professional therapist to get to that point can be somewhat costly but worthwhile.\n3.  Some people are unable to visualize things in their mind, this is known as aphantasia.\n\n**How Guided Imagery Compares to Other Techniques**\n\n*   It's an excellent stress management option.\n*   It can be easier than exercise or yoga for those with physical limitations.\n*   It has no risk of side effects like some medical and herbal therapies.\n\n**Tips for Practicing Guided Imagery**\n\n1.  Use ambient sounds that compliment your imagery.\n2.  Set an alarm, just in case you lose track of time or fall asleep.\n3.  Communicate with your subconscious mind with the help of a self-recorded or purchased tape or with the help of a therapist.\n\n**Conclusion**\nGuided imagery is a quick and effective way to deal with stress. However, other relaxation techniques, such as yoga, meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation, may also be helpful. If stress interferes with your ability to function normally, talk to your doctor or a licensed mental health professional. They can recommend strategies and treatments, including therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes.

Guided imagery can enhance the mind-body connection and:\n\n    *   Increase overall well-being\n    *   Reduce stress\n    *   Reduce anxiety\n    *   Strengthen the immune system\n    *   Decrease pain\n\n4\\. Guided imagery is a free stress-relieving therapy, and with practice, can be done just about anywhere.\n\n5\\. It can also be useful in disrupting patterns of rumination and can help you to build resources in your life that increase your resilience toward stress by engaging an upward spiral of positivity. \n\n**References**\n\n1\\.

By Julia Childs Heyl, MSW Published on May 28, 2025 Svetlana Repnitskaya Getty Images\n\n**Title**\nI'm a Therapist and I Tried the Viral 17-Second Manifestation Technique-Here's How It Went\n\n**Overview**\nCan you change your life in just 17 seconds? By Julia Childs Heyl, MSW\n\n*   Published on May 28, 2025\n*   Svetlana Repnitskaya Getty Images\n\n**What Is the 17-Second Manifestation Method?**\nThe newest trend in manifestation is the 17-second manifestation method. This TikTok-approved approach to manifesting touts that any and all dreams can be attained with just 17 seconds a day.\n\n**Trying the 17-Second Manifestation Method**\nI'm not a manifestation novice. Though I don't necessarily think about it as manifestation per se, I am a firm believer in getting clear on your desires, visualizing what they would look like, and then taking action to make them happen.\n\n1.  **Choose a Specific Desire or Goal to Manifest**\n    *   Mine was a specific desire - I wanted to make up my mind regarding a decision that would inevitably change my family's life.\n2.  **Attach a Positive Affirmation**\n    *   The positive affirmation came rather naturally. I can trust my gut became my go-to mantra.\n3.  **Focus on the Thought for 17 Seconds**\n    *   During the morning, I specifically focused on the thought for 17 seconds. However, my mind returned to it plenty of times throughout the day.\n4.  **Release the Thought and Maintain Alignment**\n    *   Releasing the thought and maintaining alignment was a bit tricky.\n\n**Does It Work?**\nMy experience may sound all good and well, but you may be stuck on a very real question: does any of this actually work?\n\n*   I turned to licensed marriage and family therapist Kim Slipski for insight.\n*   Research backs up the sentiment that simply thinking something into fruition isn't likely and can result in unnecessary risky behavior with negative consequences.\n\n**Should You Try It?**\nIt depends on how you want to approach it. While many choose to focus their manifestation on a concrete goal, like buying a house, I chose to focus on something a bit more introspective. This was a move Slipski approved.\n\n*   Explaining that many manifestation schools of thought focus on attaining material things with their goals, she feels this can ultimately be a disservice.\n*   Noting that often the pursuit of material gains is connected to feelings of inadequacy or financial insecurity, simply visualizing a desire won't automatically change your feelings.\n\n**Conclusion**\nIt can't hurt. At the bare minimum, positive thoughts can help decrease symptoms of anxiety. But, be realistic, stay consistent, and remember that your goals and desires are worthy of hard work. Don't bypass the wisdom looking for a fast solution within just 17 seconds a day. Can You Create the Life You Want Through Manifestation Meditation?

Be conscious of the activity.\n2.  Follow a single bite from start to finish, Dr. Naidoo recommends, and pay attention to the sounds of cutting the food, the smell as it wafts up to your nostrils, the texture of the food as it reaches your mouth, the flavors that change as you chew, and the feeling as you swallow your food.\n3.  Recognize your body's signals.\n4.  Slow down your eating so your body and brain can communicate.\n5.  Socialize over food.\n6.  Focus on the sensory details.\n7.  Practice mindfulness throughout your day.\n\n**Mindful Eating Is Not a Diet**\n\nThe purpose of mindful eating isn't to lose weight or cut back on calories; the purpose is to improve your relationship with food and overall eating experience.\n\n*   Dieting or restricting, in any form, doesn't work, says RanDee Anshutz, registered dietitian nutritionist.\n*   Knowing the negative impact of certain foods on your body doesn't mean you have to remove those foods from your diet. \n\n**Keep in Mind**\n\nThe practice of mindfulness has helped thousands of people live more intentionally and develop the skills necessary to manage chronic pain, disease, depression, sleeping problems, and anxiety.\n\n*   When you cook your next meal or pick up takeout, pay attention to the food and how it tastes and feels.\n*   You don't have to necessarily sit at a kitchen table and eat over an extended period of time; you just have to be willing to focus on the experience as it unfolds.

Basic meditation techniques\n2.  Types\n3.  5 meditation techniques you can try\n4.  Benefits\n5.  How to get started\n\n### Overview\n-------------\n\nBy Elizabeth Scott, PhD Updated on January 15, 2024 Reviewed by Sara Clark\n\nMeditation is widely recommended as a health-boosting practice-and for good reason. It provides many positive benefits, from reducing symptoms of stress to relieving physical complaints like headaches and even enhancing immunity to illness.\n\n### Basic Meditation Techniques\n-------------------------------\n\nThough it can be practiced in different ways, a few common threads run through virtually all meditation techniques:\n\n*   **Focused Mind**: A common misconception is that meditation causes the mind to become 'quiet' or 'clear.' In reality, your mind is always thinking. Although your thoughts might not be as rapid, it is perfectly normal for your mind to be active when meditating.\n*   **Being in the Now**: Rather than focusing on the past or future, all meditative practices involve focusing on the present.\n*   **Altered State of Consciousness**: With time, maintaining a quiet mind and focusing on the present can lead to an altered level of consciousness that isn't a sleeping state but isn't quite your average wakeful state either.\n\n### Types\n---------\n\nResearchers generally classify meditation techniques into two different categories:\n\n1.  Concentrative: Involves focusing on a particular object that's generally outside of oneself, such as a candle's flame, the sound of an instrument, or a mantra.\n2.  Non-concentrative: Can include a broader focus, such as the sounds in your environment, internal body states, and even your own breathing.\n\n### 5 Meditation Techniques You Can Try\n-----------------------------------------\n\nHere are five meditation techniques that are great for beginners (and experienced meditators, too!):\n\n1.  **Basic Meditation**: Involves sitting in a comfortable position and using the breath as a point of focus.\n2.  **Focused Meditation**: Focuses on something with intention without engaging your thoughts on it.\n3.  **Activity-Oriented Meditation**: Combines meditation with activities you may already enjoy, or with new activities that help you focus on the present.\n4.  **Mindfulness Meditation**: Involves staying in the present moment rather than thinking about the future or the past.\n5.  **Spiritual Meditation**: Can be a spiritual practice where you meditate on a singular question until an answer comes, or meditate to clear your mind and accept whatever comes that day.\n\n### Benefits\n------------\n\nMeditation has been shown to have a wide variety of mental and physical health benefits:\n\n*   Boosts mood\n*   Improves sleep\n*   Lowers stress\n*   Decreases blood pressure\n*   Improves empathy\n*   Reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression\n\n### How to Get Started\n------------------------\n\nIf you are ready to begin trying out some meditation techniques, here are some helpful tips to get started:\n\n1.  **Set Aside a Time**: Choose when you want to meditate each day.\n2.  **Find a Space**: Choose a relaxing space where you're free of distractions.\n3.  **Get Comfortable**: Sit in a comfortable position where you can sit up straight with both feet resting on the floor.\n4.  **Focus on Your Breath**: Close your eyes and focus on your breath.\n\nThe best meditation technique is one you can stick to. Consistent practice-even just quieting the mind for five minutes a day-is more valuable than sessions that are longer but infrequent. The most effective meditation technique may be particularly helpful, such as mindfulness meditation, which has been shown to be useful for anxiety disorders and depression.\n\n**References**\n--------------\n\n1.  \"Mindfulness Meditation.\" National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), nih.gov.\n2.  \"Focused Attention.\" Mindful.org, mindfulness.org.\n3.  \"What Is Meditation?\" Mindful.org, mindfulness.org.\n4.  \"The Benefits of Meditation.\" Harvard Health Publishing, health.harvard.edu.\n5.  \"Meditation and Mental Health.\" National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), nih.gov.\n6.  \"Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction: A Systematic Review of the Literature.\" Journal of Clinical Psychology, jop.sagepub.com.

They may also give us a glimpse into patterns stemming from our childhood experiences. Learn where emotions originate, how they affect our lives and behaviors, and why they manifest in the ways that they do.\n\n**The 6 Types of Basic Emotions and Their Effect on Human Behavior**\n\nEmotions are essential for human survival and functioning. They help us navigate our environment, form relationships, and make decisions that impact our well-being.\n\n1. Happiness is a positive emotion associated with feelings of joy, contentment, and satisfaction.\n2. Sadness is a negative emotion characterized by feelings of sorrow, grief, and loss.\n3.

Required fields are marked * Name Email Comment Submit Your Response\n\n**What Is Body Scan Meditation?**\n\nBody scan meditation (BSM) involves paying attention to parts of the body and bodily sensations in a gradual sequence from feet to head.\n\n**Benefits of Body Scan Meditation**\n\n*   Reduced stress is one important benefit of body scanning, which can have physical benefits such as reduced inflammation, fatigue, and insomnia.\n*   Research suggests that having a regular meditation practice can have other benefits, such as lower blood pressure, less pain, better sleep, reduced anxiety and stress, and better emotional regulation.3\n*   The body scan meditation is a very useful and effective meditation that can help you return to and maintain a relaxed state when you become too tense.\n\n**How to Do a Body Scan Meditation**\n\n1.  Get comfortable, lying down or sitting comfortably.\n2.  Take a few deep breaths, letting your breathing slow down and start breathing from your belly instead of from your chest.\n3.
