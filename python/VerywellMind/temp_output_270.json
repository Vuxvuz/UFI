    "content": "Table of Contents Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Coping Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) is a childhood condition that is characterized by severe anger, irritability, and frequent temper outbursts.\n\n**Symptoms**\nSevere, recurrent temper tantrums: Such outbursts can involve yelling, pushing, hitting, or destruction of property.\n1. Outbursts occurring three or more times a week: A child may still be diagnosed with DMDD if they don't always have this many outbursts a week.\n2. Tantrums that are out of proportion to the situation: For example, you might expect a child to get angry when they don't get a toy they want, but a child with DMDD might act out with physical aggression and verbal outbursts that are excessive and intense.\n3. Tantrums that are inappropriate for the child's age level: For example, while you might not be surprised if a very young child has a tantrum that involves falling to the floor crying and screaming, it is not something you would expect from a 12-year-old.\n4. Irritable and angry moods between tantrums: In between bouts of intense emotional outbursts, kids with DMDD have moods that are consistently angry and extremely irritable.\n5. Symptoms happen in multiple settings: This means that temper outbursts don't just occur in a single setting, such as at school.\n\n**Causes**\nThe exact causes of DMDD are not clear, although there are a number of factors that are believed to play a role.\n*   Genetics\n*   Temperament\n*   Co-occurring mental conditions\n*   Childhood experiences\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\n1.  A child must be between the ages of six and 18 to be diagnosed with DMDD.\n2.  The symptoms of DMDD include severe, recurrent temper tantrums, outbursts occurring three or more times a week, tantrums that are out of proportion to the situation, tantrums that are inappropriate for the child's age level, irritable and angry moods between tantrums, and symptoms happening in multiple settings.\n3.  The first step of diagnosis involves assessing a child's health, ruling out other health conditions, and then evaluating the child's symptoms.\n4.  A doctor or psychiatrist may also interview the child, parents, other caregivers, and teachers to get a clearer view of a child's behaviors.\n\n**Treatment**\n\n*   Psychotherapy is usually considered a first-line treatment and may include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and parent training.\n*   CBT helps kids learn to recognize the thoughts that contribute to feelings of anger and learn new ways of responding to different situations.\n*   Therapists may also work with parents to help them learn new ways of responding to their child's anger and outbursts.\n*   Medication while more research is needed to help determine which types of medication may be the most effective for treating this condition, psychiatrists may prescribe stimulants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, or antidepressants to treat symptoms of DMDD.\n\n**Coping**\n\n*   Understand your child's triggers: If your child is likely to have a tantrum in certain settings or situations, try to have a plan in place.\n*   Keep your child safe: If your child is prone to acting out physically, try to keep any potentially dangerous objects out of reach.\n*   Teach coping skills: In one case study, a child with DMDD was taught to mentally recite song lyrics whenever she found herself becoming angry. This was also combined with using deep breathing and reciting verbal reminders to help interrupt angry outbursts before they began.\n*   Encourage positive behaviors: Reward appropriate behaviors with attention, praise, and privileges. In multi-child households, kids sometimes go unnoticed when they are behaving well, but are able to get one-on-one attention when they misbehave. This tends to reinforce misbehavior and discourage good behavior. Break this pattern by making sure that you notice and reward your child's positive actions.  </div> </div> </div> <hr /> <h2 id=\"Table-of-Contents\">Table of Contents</h2><ul> <li><a href=\"#Symptoms\" title=\"Symptoms\"><span class=\"mw-headline\">Symptoms</span></a></li> <li><a href=\"#Causes\" title=\"Causes\"><span class=\"mw-headline\">Causes</span></a></li> <li><a href=\"#Diagnosis\" title=\"Diagnosis\"><span class=\"mw-headline\">Diagnosis</span></a></li> <li><a href=\"#Treatment\" title=\"Treatment\"><span class=\"mw-headline\">Treatment</span></a></li> <li><a href=\"#Coping\" title=\"Coping\"><span class=\"mw-headline\">Coping</span></a></li> </ul> </div> <hr /> <p id=\"References-1\"></p> <h2 id=\"References\">References</h2> <ol> <li>By Kendra Cherry, MSEd Kendra Cherry, MS, is a psychosocial rehabilitation specialist, psychology educator, and author of the Everything Psychology Book.

    "content": "1. National Institute of Mental Health, \"Schizophrenia\" 2. Genetic Science Learning Center, \"Genetics and Schizophrenia\" 3. Harvard University, \"What is schizophrenia?\" Schizophrenia is a mental illness that affects how the brain works. This leads to chronic problems with disordered thoughts and behaviors and symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and lack of emotional expression. Schizophrenia affects approximately 0.3% to 0.7% of people. It impacts people from all racial backgrounds and ethnicities and is slightly more common in men than in women. The exact causes are unknown, but it has both genetic and environmental risk factors. It usually requires lifelong care and treatment to help people manage their symptoms and live full, active lives.\n\n**Understanding Schizophrenia**\n\nI'm a Mental Health Professional and I Live with a Psychotic Disorder-Here's What It Feels Like\n\n*   Dissociative Disorder vs. Schizophrenia: What Are the Differences?\n*   The Experience of Hearing Voices in Schizophrenia\n*   How to Manage Caregiving for Schizophrenia\n\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nWhat causes schizophrenia?\n\nThe exact causes of schizophrenia are not entirely understood, but a complex variety of influences likely play a role. Some potential causes include genetic, environmental, social, and psychological factors.\n\nLearn More: Causes and Risk Factors for Schizophrenia\n\nIs schizophrenia genetic?\n\nResearch suggests that genetics play a significant role in causing schizophrenia. Having a family member with the condition greatly increases your risk of developing schizophrenia. However, while the condition sometimes runs in families, having a family member with the condition does not necessarily mean that you will develop the disorder.\n\nLearn More: How Is Schizophrenia Treated?\n\nAt what age does schizophrenia typically develop?\n\nResearch suggests that early symptoms of schizophrenia begin to appear sometime between late adolescence and early twenties, although they may begin later or earlier. The age of onset is also typically later in women than in men. Symptoms appear gradually and become progressively more severe.\n\n**Key Terms**\n\n*   Psychosis\n*   Antipsychotics\n*   Psychosocial Intervention\n*   Electroconvulsive Therapy\n*   Mania\n*   Delusions\n\n**Psychosis, Antipsychotics, and More**\n\nWhat is psychosis?\n\nPsychosis is a condition that affects the way the brain processes information and causes people to lose touch with reality. Symptoms of psychosis often include having false ideas about what is happening (delusions) or seeing and hearing things that are not really there (hallucinations).\n\nWhat are antipsychotics?\n\nAntipsychotics are medications used primarily to manage psychosis. While they do not cure the condition, they can help manage the symptoms of schizophrenia.\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nPsychosocial interventions include activities that focus on the cognitive, behavioral, social, and biological factors that play a role in an individual's well-being. Common psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia include cognitive therapy, psychoeducation, family intervention, assertive community treatment, and social skills training.\n\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a psychiatric treatment that involves using electrical stimulation to induce seizures. It is most frequently utilized for treatment-resistant depression, but it is sometimes used to treat schizophrenia that has not responded to treatment with antipsychotics.\n\n**Living with Schizophrenia**\n\nA Family Affair: How Taye Diggs Is Lifting Up the Schizophrenia Community\n\nTreatment for Psychosis\n\nWhat is a dopamine agonist?\n\nHow schizophrenia is treated\n\nInvega: Benefits, Side Effects, Dosage, and Interactions\n\nWhat is delusional disorder?\n\nWhat does it mean to have a psychotic break?\n\n**Types of Psychosis**\n\nDelusions vs. Hallucinations: What Are the Differences?\n\nTypes of psychosis\n\nWhat causes psychosis?\n\nPsychosis vs. Schizophrenia: What Are the Differences?\n\nThe relationship between schizophrenia and dopamine\n\nSchizoaffective disorder: Depressive type\n\nWhat is a schizophrenic episode?\n\nWhat is schizoaffective disorder: Bipolar type?\n\n**Early Signs and Symptoms**\n\nWhat are persecutory delusions?\n\nWhat is disorganized schizophrenia?\n\nWhat is schizoaffective disorder?\n\nSchizophrenia in children\n\nParanoia as a symptom of schizophrenia\n\nCauses and risk factors of schizophrenia\n\nThinking process abnormalities in schizophrenia\n\nSchizoaffective disorder and schizophrenia: What are the differences?\n\nPositive symptoms in schizophrenia\n\nNegative symptoms in schizophrenia\n\nSigns and symptoms of schizophrenia\n\nFlat affect in schizophrenia\n\nCatatonic symptoms in schizophrenia and other conditions\n\nAvolition or lack of motivation in schizophrenia\n\nThe relationship between autism and schizophrenia\n\n**More In Conditions A-Z**\n\nNeurodivergence\n\nPhobias\n\nAnxiety\n\nKids' Mental Health\n\nAddiction\n\nADHD\n\nEating Disorders\n\nBipolar Disorder\n\nBPD\n\nDepression\n\nNeurological Disorders\n\nPTSD\n\nOCD\n\nPanic Disorder\n\nPage Sources\n\n1.

They allow us to realize what's most important to us, from the people we care about to the opinions we hold, and force us to navigate the complexities of everyday life.\n\n*   Emotions give us a glimpse into patterns stemming from our childhood experiences.\n*   Emotions may also influence our behaviors and interactions with others.\n*   Understanding emotions is crucial for developing emotional intelligence, self-awareness, and healthy relationships.\n\n**The 6 Types of Basic Emotions and Their Effect on Human Behavior**\n\nResearch suggests that there are six basic emotions-happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger, and surprise-that are universally experienced in all human cultures. These emotions play a significant role in shaping our behavior, decision-making processes, and interactions with others.\n\n*   Happiness: associated with feelings of joy, contentment, and well-being.\n*   Sadness: linked to feelings of sorrow, grief, and loss.\n*   Fear: related to feelings of anxiety, apprehension, and danger.\n*   Disgust: associated with feelings of revulsion, distaste, and aversion.\n*   Anger: linked to feelings of frustration, irritation, and hostility.\n*   Surprise: associated with feelings of astonishment, shock, and excitement.\n\n**Emotions and Types of Emotional Responses**\n\nEmotions can be broadly categorized into two types: primary emotions and secondary emotions. Primary emotions are the basic emotions listed above, while secondary emotions are derived from these primary emotions.\n\n*   Primary emotions: happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger, and surprise.\n*   Secondary emotions: jealousy, guilt, shame, pride, and envy.\n\n**The Important Role of Emotions**\n\nEmotions play a crucial role in our daily lives. They help us:\n\n*   Make decisions: emotions influence our decision-making processes, often guiding us towards what we perceive as beneficial or threatening.\n*   Interact with others: emotions shape our relationships, influencing how we communicate, empathize, and respond to others' needs.\n*   Regulate stress: emotions help us cope with stress, anxiety, and other forms of emotional distress.\n\n**Healthy Coping Skills for Uncomfortable Emotions**\n\nDeveloping healthy coping skills is essential for managing uncomfortable emotions. Some effective strategies include:\n\n*   Mindfulness practices: meditation, deep breathing, and yoga can help regulate emotions and reduce stress.\n*   Physical activity: engaging in regular exercise can release endorphins, which can improve mood and reduce anxiety.\n*   Social support: seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist can provide emotional validation and help individuals process their feelings.\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n1.  How many emotions are there?\n2.  What causes emotions?\n3.  Can we control our emotions?\n\nBy understanding the complexities of emotions, we can develop greater self-awareness, improve our relationships, and cultivate healthier coping mechanisms for managing uncomfortable emotions. Emotions are a natural part of being human, and acknowledging their importance can help us navigate life's challenges with greater ease and resilience. \n\n**Key Terms**\n\n*   Emotional Intelligence: refers to the ability to perceive, control, and evaluate emotions.\n*   Emotion Wheel: an emotion classification system introduced by psychologist Robert Plutchik in the 1980s.\n*   Expression: the act of communicating thoughts and emotions with others.\n*   Mood: a relatively stable affective state that is often described as positive or negative.\n\n**Explore Understanding Emotions**\n\nFor further exploration, visit our recommended articles",

Last medically reviewed on March 03, 2024\n\n**Signs You May Have a Gambling Addiction**\n\nGambling disorder is a serious mental health condition that can have devastating effects on individuals and families. If you or someone you love has a gambling problem, it's essential to know the signs and risk factors associated with this addiction.\n\n**Warning Signs**\n\nYou might be addicted if:\n\n*   You are gambling all of your financial resources away (your paycheck, your savings, your retirement, your inheritance), and have borrowed from Peter to pay Paul as well.\n*   You are accruing debt that is out of control, unable to fulfill your financial obligations, and possibly filing bankruptcy (again).\n*   You continue to gamble despite experiencing significant losses (relationships, jobs, and even your home).\n*   You have made gambling a priority over everything and everyone, even neglecting your own hygiene and basic health needs.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\nA combination of genetic, environmental, psychological, and social factors can contribute to the development of a gambling addiction. Some common risk factors include:\n\n*   Age: Anyone at any age can develop a gambling addiction.\n*   Sex: Gambling disorder is slightly more prevalent in men than women.\n*   Genetics: Family history has been found to play a role in pathological gambling.\n*   Personality: Various personality traits have been linked with gambling addiction, including being impulsive, energetic, highly competitive, and easily bored.\n*   Mental health: More than 95% of people with a gambling disorder also meet the criteria for a psychiatric disorder.\n\n**Cognitive Distortions**\n\nPeople with a gambling problem often experience distorted thinking patterns that maintain unhealthy behavior. Some common cognitive distortions include:\n\n*   Incorrect understanding of probability\n*   Illusion of control\n*   Superstitions\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nRecovering from a gambling addiction takes hard work, but several treatments have been found to be effective, including:\n\n*   Psychotherapy\n*   Cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral therapy\n*   Family therapy\n*   Medication\n*   Support groups like Gamblers Anonymous (Gam-Anon)\n\n**Controversies**\n\nLike other behavioral addictions, gambling addiction is a controversial idea. Some experts believe that there has to be a psychoactive substance that produces symptoms for an activity to be a true addiction. However, research literature and treatment services have shown that pathological gambling has the most credibility among the behavioral addictions.\n\nIf you or someone you love has a gambling problem, talk to your doctor or mental health professional about your treatment options. There are many resources available to help individuals overcome a gambling addiction, including online therapy programs, self-help strategies, and support groups. With the right support and treatment, it is possible to recover from a gambling addiction and live a healthy, fulfilling life.\n\n*   **What is the main cause of a gambling addiction?** The exact causes of gambling disorder are not known, but a combination of factors may play a part.\n*   **How can someone overcome a gambling addiction?** Self-help strategies and support groups can be beneficial. As you are recovering, find ways to avoid your gambling triggers and look for alternatives to gambling.\n*   **What is the best way to help someone with a gambling addiction?** Talking about the problem and encouraging them to get help are important first steps. Emphasize that you are concerned, that you care, and that you can help them find the support they need to address their gambling addiction.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

    "content": "Disclaimer Privacy Policy Last Updated: July 23, 2024 An addiction is a disorder characterized by the compulsive use of a substance or activity that triggers our reward systems despite experiencing adverse consequences. A person's genes and environment influence this complex condition. Addiction is widely viewed as a brain disease due to how it impacts the brain's reward, pleasure, and self-control circuits. In the past, addiction was thought to only encompass substance abuse, but the definition has been expanded to include activities like gambling as well as gaming, shopping, and exercise. It's also important to note that addiction is about the underlying neurology of the brain and not about the outward behaviors. With appropriate treatment, people with addictions can go on to live happy, healthy lives.\n\n**Understanding Addiction**\n\nAddiction is a complex condition influenced by genetics and environment.\nIt affects the brain's reward, pleasure, and self-control circuits.\nThe definition has been expanded to include activities beyond substance abuse.\n\n*   **Can Tapering Off Alcohol Prevent Withdrawal?**\n*   **What Does It Mean to Be Sober Curious?**\n*   **Can Self-Improvement Feel Like Too Much of a Good Thing?**\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\nIs addiction a disease?\nYes, addiction is a treatable, chronic disease that affects the brain's reward, motivation, memory, and related circuitry.\n\nWhat causes addiction?\nPeople engage in potentially addictive activities to feel pleasure, and over time, the reinforcing effect of these activities may change brain chemistry to create an unconscious drive to continue the behavior.\nMultiple factors influence this process, including genetics, diet, mental health, past traumas, pain, stress, and stage of life.\n\n**Breaking an Addiction**\n\nThe first step in overcoming addiction is to desire change and avoid the people, places, and things that promote the addiction.\nSupport groups, mentors, and 12-step programs provide help, while counselors, recovery centers, and physicians provide expertise and medication to treat cravings and the effects of withdrawal.\nEating healthy and getting exercise also play an important role in recovery.\n\n**Genetics and Addiction**\n\nA person's genetics account for about half of their risk for developing an addiction.\nThe impact of genetics is influenced by an interaction between a person's environment, diet, and biology.\nAlcoholism tends to run in families, and members of those families are at increased risk for developing alcoholism.\n\n**Key Terms**\n\n*   **Substance Use Disorder**\n*   **Behavioral Addiction**\n*   **Intervention**\n*   **Comorbidity**\n\n**Exploring Addiction**\n\n*   **Why Emotional Sobriety Is a Critical Part of Your Recovery Journey**\n*   **What Does It Take to Get Sober? 3 People Share How They Coped**\n*   **Understanding Enabler Behavior: Motivations, Signs, and Strategies for Change**\n*   **Redefining Sobriety: The Rise of the California Sober Lifestyle**\n\n**Strategies for Overcoming Addiction**\n\nThe first step in overcoming addiction is to desire change.\nSupport groups, mentors, and 12-step programs provide help.\nCounselors, recovery centers, and physicians provide expertise and medication to treat cravings and the effects of withdrawal.\n\n**Substance Use Disorders**\n\n*   **What Are Substance Use Disorders?**\n*   **Behavioral Addiction**\n*   **Intervention**\n\n**Comorbidity**\n\nComorbidity refers to the presence of more than one distinct condition in an individual.\nA common example is when someone with a mental illness also has a substance use disorder.\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\nIs addiction genetic?\nYes, a person's genetics account for about half of their risk for developing an addiction.

In some cases, people can experience withdrawal when they stop the behavior.\n\n**Intervention**\n\nAn intervention is one of several strategies used to persuade an addicted person to get help for their addiction.\nInterventions are an organized attempt by family members or friends to confront a loved one about how their addictive behavior has affected them.\nAlthough commonly used, data on their effectiveness is lacking.\n\n**Comorbidity**\n\nComorbidity refers to the presence of more than one distinct condition in an individual.\nA common example is when someone with a mental illness also has a substance use disorder. Neither condition causes the other, and successful treatment will often address both conditions at the same time.\n\n**Exploring Addiction**\n\n*   **Why Emotional Sobriety Is a Critical Part of Your Recovery Journey**\n*   **What Does It Take to Get Sober? 3 People Share How They Coped**\n*   **Understanding Enabler Behavior: Motivations, Signs, and Strategies for Change**\n*   **Redefining Sobriety: The Rise of the California Sober Lifestyle**  Note: This response has been paraphrased from the provided content.

Paying for Online Couples Therapy Why Trust Verywell Mind There are as many reasons to seek couples therapy as there are, well, couples: perhaps you want to work through a reoccurring issue, improve communication, or gain better tools to handle stress. Or maybe you want to keep a finely tuned relationship humming. No matter why you're seeking it, couples therapy can be an effective way to be happier with your partner.1 As a licensed social worker and former therapist, I am all for couples therapy-and I recognize that online couples therapy is often more affordable and convenient than in-person sessions. Over the last three years, I've overseen extensive testing of 55 different online therapy companies and have thoroughly reviewed all of their therapy services, including couples counseling. If you're seeking couples therapy, these are the services I recommend. See an in-depth comparison of all the online therapy providers we recommend. The 5 Best Online Couples Therapy Companies Compare Providers Who It's Best For Costs Types of Therapy Offered Regain Couples who need to access sessions from different locations $280-$400 per month Couples therapy, individual relationship counseling Online-Therapy.com Couples who want a wide variety of resources $120 per week ($96 for first month) Couples therapy, individual therapy Talkspace Couples who need to use their insurance $436 per month Couples therapy, individual therapy, teen therapy, psychiatry Growing Self People looking for a wide range of types of relationship counseling $75-$170 per session Couples therapy, relationship coaching, individual therapy, coaching Modern Intimacy Couples looking for sex therapy $200-$450 per session Sex therapy, couples therapy, coaching, individual therapy Regain Learn More (opens in a new tab) Pricing and Essential Info Who It's Best For: Couples who need to access their sessions from different locations Accepts Insurance: No Costs: $70 to $100 per week, billed as a monthly subscription Types of Therapy Offered: Couples therapy, individual relationship counseling Session Formats: Live video, audio, messaging Session Length: 30 to 45 minutes Pros Can do couples or individual relationship therapy, or can invite a partner to join later on You and your partner can access sessions from different devices Focused exclusively on relationships Cons Doesn't take insurance The quality of individual therapists varies Short sessions What I Like About Regain I had six testers try out Regain's couples therapy, and in every case, my testers liked that they could message their therapist anytime through the patient portal and generally received prompt and personalized messages. Regain also differs from other online couples therapy services by offering sessions both for couples and for individuals wanting relationship advice and support, a service my testers tried twice. In addition, my testers especially appreciated that they and their partners could attend their sessions from different locations, making Regain even more convenient-and convenience like this can be the difference between being able to attend couples therapy and not. Three of my testers were very pleased with the therapists they were assigned. They found their therapists to be friendly, warm, and approachable while still being professional-it was clear that these therapists were well-versed in couples counseling and helped my testers set goals and work through problems, which is what many couples seeking therapy together want or need to do. The magic of online therapy lies in finding the right therapist for you and your partner. The good thing about Regain is how easy it is to switch therapists until you find such a person. My testers needed to switch therapists multiple times across all our testing, and the process couldn't have been simpler. While the testers sometimes didn't jive with the first person they met with, almost all the testers eventually found someone that suited their needs. To better help with the search, Regain allows you to filter for identities like gender, sexuality, and race. My 100 surveyed Regain users were mostly happy with their experiences: 93% of users said it was easy or very easy to find therapists who fit the criteria they were looking for, vastly out-performing every other company 87% rated Regain as very good or excellent overall What Users Say Things to Consider Online-Therapy.com Learn More (opens in a new tab) Pricing and Essential Info Who It's Best For: Couples who want access to a wide variety of resources to support their therapy sessions Accepts Insurance: No Costs: Couples therapy subscription is $120 per week ($96 per week for the first month) Types of Therapy Offered: Couples therapy, individual therapy Session Formats: Live video, audio, messaging Session Length: 45 minutes Pros Extensive resources available on site Unlimited messaging with your therapist More affordable than most in",

Clinical Syndromes\n*   Axis II - Personality Disorders and Mental Retardation\n*   Axis III - General Medical Conditions\n*   Axis IV - Psychosocial and Environmental Problems\n*   Axis V - Global Assessment of Functioning\n\nAxis I consisted of mental health and substance use disorders that cause significant impairment.\nDisorders were grouped into different categories such as mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and eating disorders.\n\nAxis II was reserved for what we now call intellectual development disorders (intellectual disability) and personality disorders, such as antisocial personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder.\nPersonality disorders cause significant problems in how a person relates to the world, while intellectual development disorders are characterized by intellectual impairment and deficits in other areas such as self-care and interpersonal skills.\n\nAxis III was used for medical conditions that influence or worsen Axis I and Axis II disorders.\nSome examples include HIV/AIDS and brain injuries.\n\nAxis IV accounted for any social or environmental problems that may impact Axis I or Axis II disorders.\nThese include such things as unemployment, relocation, divorce, or the death of a loved one.\n\nAxis V is where the clinician gives their impression of the client's overall level of functioning.\nBased on this assessment, clinicians could better understand how the other four axes interacted and the effect on the individual's life.\n\n**Changes in the DSM-5**\nThe **DSM-V** includes significant changes from the **DSM-IV** and **DSM-IV-TR**.7\nThe most obvious change is the shift from using Roman numerals to Arabic numbers in the name (i.e., **DSM-5**, not **DSM-V**).\nPerhaps most notably, the **DSM-5** eliminated the multiaxial system.\nInstead, the **DSM-5** lists categories of disorders along with related disorders.\n\nExample categories in the **DSM-5** include anxiety disorders, bipolar and related disorders, depressive disorders, feeding and eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, and personality disorders.\n\nA few other changes that came with the **DSM-5** included:\n\n*   Asperger syndrome was eliminated as a diagnosis and, instead, incorporated under the category of autism spectrum disorder.\n*   Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder was added, in part to decrease the over-diagnosis of childhood bipolar disorders.\n*   Several diagnoses were officially added to the manual, including binge eating disorder, hoarding disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).\n\nWhile the **DSM-5** is an important tool, only those who have received specialized training and possess sufficient experience are qualified to diagnose and treat mental illnesses.\n\n**Changes in the DSM-5-TR**\nThe **DSM-5-TR** contains revised criteria for more than 70 disorders, including prolonged grief disorder.\nThere are new codes added to the **DSM-5-TR** that allow clinicians to document suicidal behavior and nonsuicidal self-injury in patients without any other psychiatric diagnosis.\n\nThe **DSM-5-TR** uses more specific language to avoid reader confusion.\nFor example:\n\n*   Criterion A in autism spectrum disorder was changed from as manifested by the following to as manifested by all of the following to indicate that all symptoms must be present for this diagnosis.\n*   Social phobia, which appeared next to social anxiety disorder, was removed.\n*   Intellectual disability was revised to intellectual development disorder.\n*   Terms surrounding gender dysphoria were changed significantly.\n\nUsed in **DSM-5**\n\n*   Desired gender\n*   Cross-sex medical procedure\n*   Natal male\n*   Natal female\n\nUsed in **DSM-5-TR**\n\n*   Experienced gender\n*   Gender affirming medical procedure\n*   Individual assigned male at birth\n*   Individual assigned female at birth\n\nThe **DSM-",
