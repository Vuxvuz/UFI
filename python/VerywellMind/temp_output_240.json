Many people have an idea of what traditional talk therapy looks like with adults, and they might have an idea of what play therapy looks like with young children. Adolescents are a distinct group, no longer children but not yet adults, and as such have unique needs. Working in adolescent psychology means considering the specific needs of someone whose brain has developed past the childhood stage but has not fully matured into adulthood.\n\n### The History of Adolescent Psychology\nThe concept of adolescence is relatively new, having only been recognized in the United States starting in the late nineteenth century. Previously, adolescents were essentially seen as miniature adults. However, we currently understand that development continues throughout the lifespan, meaning that teenagers are different from adults developmentally. Specifically, decades of research have shown that adolescents undergo significant brain development, impacting their behavior and functioning during this phase.\n\n### What Is Typical Teen Behavior?\nA common question for parents is, How do I know what is typical teen behavior? Although it is expected for adolescents to question their parents, push back on boundaries, and experience some growing pains as they develop their sense of self, it can be challenging for parents to identify what falls outside of that range of typical development. Parents might struggle with balancing enforcing healthy boundaries and fostering a positive relationship with their teens.\n\n### Therapy With Adolescents\nBecause adolescent brains are different than adult brains, therapy with adolescents does not look the same as therapy with adults. Things parents can keep in mind if their adolescent is in therapy include:\n\n1. Relationship is key.\n2. The most important part of any therapeutic relationship is trust and rapport with the therapist, and this is especially true for adolescents.\n3. Privacy and confidentiality are essential.\n4. Many parents want to know what happens in their teen's therapy sessions.\n5. Curiosity is understandable; however, demanding that the teen or therapist disclose information from sessions will often do more harm than good.\n6. Laws vary by state, but parents might have the right to this information.\n7. In this case, letting the adolescent know that their parent will respect their privacy can allow them to engage and benefit from their sessions.\n\n### What Is the Storm and Stress View of Adolescence?\nThe storm and stress view of adolescence is a concept where it's believed that adolescents are particularly prone to emotional turmoil due to the significant changes they experience during this phase. This view suggests that adolescents often struggle with mood swings, impulsivity, and rebellious behavior as they navigate their identity and independence.\n\n### How to Find a Therapist\nIf your teen needs therapy, it is OK. A parent cannot control everything that happens to their child, and no parent is perfect. Recognizing that the adolescent needs therapy and support from adults other than the parents is part of good parenting and does not indicate that the parent has somehow failed their child.\n\nAdolescents have needs that differ from both younger children and adults. When determining their psychological needs and providing appropriate care, it is essential to understand their unique phase of life and meet them where they are. How to find a therapist and resources for further information can be found in the 'Read More' section below. \n\n## Read More\nPSYCHOLOGY THEORIES 7 Sources\n\n### Dr. Amy Marschall's Bio\nDr. Amy Marschall is an autistic clinical psychologist with ADHD, working with children and adolescents who also identify with these neurotypes among others.

What to Know About Internal Family Systems (IFS) Therapy\n\n**Overview**\nInternal family systems, or IFS, is a type of therapy that believes we are all made up of several parts or sub-personalities.\n\n*   It draws from structural, strategic, narrative, and Bowenian types of family therapy.\n*   The founder of IFS therapy, Dr. Richard Schwartz, thought of the mind as an inner family and began applying techniques to individuals that he usually used with families.\n*   The underlying concept of this theory is that we all have several parts living within us that fulfill both healthy and unhealthy roles.\n\n**The Self in IFS Therapy**\n\n*   The goal of IFS therapy is to find your Self and bring all of these parts together.\n*   It suggests that it is your core Self that is who you truly are.\n*   The therapy process promotes healing, trust in the Self, and the coordination of all components.\n\n**Techniques of IFS Therapy**\n\n*   While there may be infinite parts within you, there are three main types:\n    *   Firefighter parts\n    *   Manager parts\n    *   Exile\n*   A six-step process is used to help you find these parts and release their burdens.\n1.  Find: Identify a part to work with.\n2.  Focus: Turn your attention inward and focus on the identified part.\n3.  Flesh Out: Learn more about the part, including its emotions, color, age, or other characteristics.\n4.  Feel Toward: Explore how you feel about this part and its role in your life.\n5.  Befriend: Develop a sense of acceptance and compassion for the part.\n6.  Fear: Understand what fears this part may have.\n\n**What to Expect**\n\n*   Your first session will cover basic information about IFS therapy and an initial assessment.\n*   You'll build a comfortable, trusting rapport with your therapist.\n*   Each session involves talk therapy and exploring inner parts of the Self.\n\n**Benefits of IFS Therapy**\n\n*   It can help with general life stressors like grief, relationship, and career issues.\n*   Improve resilience and self-esteem.\n*   Treat several mental health issues, including anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, dissociative identity disorder, eating disorders, and substance use disorders.\n\n**Effectiveness of IFS Therapy**\n\n*   Research shows that IFS therapy can reduce signs of depression and pain symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n*   It was added to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's National Registry for Evidence-Based Programs and Practices.\n*   The registry rated it as effective and promising for various mental health conditions.\n\n**Things to Consider**\n\n*   You may feel worse before you feel better, especially when facing problems.\n*   If you're experiencing suicidal thoughts or engaging in self-harm, talk to your therapist or seek help from a national helpline.\n*   IFS therapy might not be suitable for individuals with schizophrenia or active delusions.\n\n**How to Get Started**\n\n*   Find a certified IFS therapist using the IFS Institute's directory.\n*   Set up a consultation to discuss your preferences and find a good fit.\n*   Begin working on identifying parts and building connections between them. 1. \"Trauma-related dissociative symptoms, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD): A review of the evidence.\" Journal of Clinical Psychology 75.9 (2019): 1823-1834. doi: 10.1002/jclp.22920\n2. \"Internal Family Systems Therapy for Eating Disorders: A Case Series.\" The Cognitive Behavioral Therapist 21.1 (2020): 23-33. doi: 10.1017/S1537647120000038\n3. \"The Effects of Internal Family Systems Therapy on Childhood Trauma and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms in Adults: A Pilot Study.\" Journal of Clinical Psychology 76.1 (2020): 47-56. doi: 10.1002/jclp.22923\n4. \"Internal Family Systems therapy for depression: A pilot study.\" Journal of Clinical Psychology 70.1 (2014): 15-25. doi: 10.1002/jclp.22034\n5. \"The Effects of Internal Family Systems Therapy on Pain Symptoms in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.\" Journal of Clinical Psychology 72.3 (2016): 236-244. doi: 10.1002/jclp.22333\n6.

    "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/is-therapy-ever-the-wrong-treatment-6504541",
    "content": "& Suggestions with Us \n\n**When Therapy Is the Wrong Treatment Option**\n\nThere are a handful of reasons that therapy might be the wrong treatment option, including time, money, and just not being ready to change yet.\n\n*   Financial constraints may be one of the biggest roadblocks to therapy.\n*   If you're in a situation that is either still ongoing or happened recently and is really emotionally raw for you, you might not be ready to process it if you're not ready to give up that anger.\n*   Intimate partner violence can make therapy dangerous because the abuser might see the credit charge and get angry, or the therapist might push a client to make a change and leave the partner when that's not a physically safe option for them at the moment.\n*   Suicidal ideation or self-harming behaviors may require more immediate intervention than traditional therapy can usually provide.\n*   Severe mental illness is defined as anything in the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID), including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, major depressive disorder, recurrent, bipolar I, acute mania, and adult ADHD.\n\n**When Therapy Could Even Be Dangerous**\n\nWhile therapy is relatively safe generally, there are a few distinct situations where therapy could cause more harm than good. These include:\n\n*   Intimate partner violence, as mentioned earlier.\n*   Suicidal ideation or self-harming behaviors that require immediate intervention beyond what traditional therapy can provide.\n\n**What If You Decide That Therapy Isn't Right For You at This Time?**\n\nIf you realize that therapy might not be right for you right now, there are many resources out there that can help you manage your own mental health if you're otherwise feeling relatively stable and safe. These include:\n\n*   Recognizing what your baseline is by thinking about who you are when you're calm and at ease.\n*   Engaging in activities that bring you joy.\n*   Considering group therapy, which is often cheaper than individual therapy.\n*   Seeking out a peer support specialist.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nEven if you've heard people say that anyone and everyone can and should go to therapy, sometimes it's just not what's best for you at the moment. Listen to yourself and be respectful of your needs. If it doesn't feel like the right time or if it's outside of your budget, deciding not to go to therapy can actually be the right choice.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.  \"The Benefits of Therapy.\" Verywell Mind.\n2.  \"How therapy compares to a raise in making us happy.\" The Guardian.\n3.  \"Money vs. therapy: which is more effective at making people happier?\" BBC News.\n4.  \"Anger Management Techniques.\" Verywell Mind.\n5.  \"Couples therapy and intimate partner violence.\" Psychology Today.\n6.  \"The Best Combination of Therapy and Medication for Severe Mental Illness.\" Healthline.\n7.  \"Online Group Therapy: Is It Right for You?\" GoodTherapy.org.\n8.  \"Peer Support Specialists: What Are They and How Can They Help?\" Verywell Mind.\n9.  \"What is a Peer Support Specialist?\" Psychology Today.\n\nThe information in this article was last updated on January 10, 2025.

    "content": "on This Article Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles. Read our editorial policy to learn more about how we fact-check and keep our content accurate, reliable, and trustworthy.\n\n**What Is Gate Control Theory?**\n\nGate control theory suggests that the spinal cord contains a neurological 'gate' that either blocks pain signals or allows them to continue on to the brain.\n\n*   Unlike an actual gate, which opens and closes to allow all things to pass through, the gate in the spinal cord differentiates between fiber types when carrying pain signals.\n*   Specifically, pain signals traveling via small nerve fibers are allowed to pass through the gate while signals sent by large nerve fibers are blocked.\n\n**History**\n\nGate control theory was first proposed by researchers Ronald Melzack and Patrick Wall in 1965. The purpose of this theory was to help explain how mental states impact the perception of pain, either reducing or increasing pain sensations.\n\n*   Prior to gate control theory, scientists had other theories on pain, including:\n    *   Specificity theory of pain\n    *   Intensity theory of pain\n    *   Pattern theory of pain\n\n**How Gate Control Theory Works**\n\nFollowing an injury, pain signals are transmitted to the spinal cord, then up to the brain. Melzack and Wall suggest that along the way, pain messages encounter nerve gates that control whether these signals are allowed to pass through.\n\n*   The gating mechanism takes place in the dorsal horns of the spinal cord.\n*   Both small nerve fibers (pain fibers) and large nerve fibers (normal fibers for touch, pressure, and other skin senses) carry information to two areas of the dorsal horn.\n*   One part of the dorsal horn that receives information is the transmission cells.\n*   The other is inhibitory interneurons that either halt or impede the transmission of sensory information.\n\n**Impact**\n\nGate control theory has had a significant impact on our understanding of pain perception and management. It has prompted additional research in this area and contributed to the development of new therapeutic approaches.\n\n*   Gate control theory is used to explain why massage and touch can be helpful pain management strategies during childbirth.\n*   The theory is also used to explain the benefits of dance and music for relieving labor pain.\n\n**How to Use Gate Control to Reduce Pain**\n\nThe gate control theory suggests that finding ways to close the gate between the spinal cord and brain may help reduce pain. There are several strategies you can use to do this, including:\n\n1.  Focusing on something else\n2.  Getting regular exercise\n3.  Relaxing\n4.  Staying optimistic\n5.  Using counter-stimulation techniques\n\n**Potential Pitfalls of Gate Control Theory**\n\nWhile gate control theory is one of the most influential theories of pain perception, it is not without problems. Many of the ideas suggested by Melzack and Wall have not been substantiated by research.\n\n*   The theory contradicts some aspects of human biology.\n*   It failed to explain both phantom pain and chronic pain issues.\n*   A new theory of brain function was proposed in 1996 to better explain complex pain issues. \n\n**A Word From Verywell**\n\nGate control theory may not explain every aspect of how people experience pain, but it has helped transform approaches to pain management. The gate control theory is still a useful concept for understanding the psychological factors that influence pain perception and management. While it may have its limitations, gate control theory remains an important contribution to our understanding of pain and its treatment. \n\n**Sources**\n\n1\\. Melzack, R., & Wall, P. D. (1965).

These guidelines provide writers with a consistent formula for acknowledging the works of others, notes on how to order, structure, and format a paper, as well as practical writing and grammar tips. APA format is used by students and professionals in a variety of disciplines, including business, economics, nursing, and, of course, psychology.\n\nHow to Write a Paper in APA Format\n\nVariable A variable is something that can be changed or altered, such as a characteristic or value. Variables are generally used in psychology experiments to determine if changes to one thing result in changes to another.\n\nTypes of Variables in Psychology Research Correlation\n\nA correlation coefficient, often expressed as r, indicates a measure of the direction and strength of a relationship between two variables. Correlational studies are quite common in psychology, particularly because some things are impossible to recreate or research in a lab setting. Instead of performing an experiment, researchers may collect data to look at possible relationships between variables.\n\nWhat Is a Correlation?\n\nAbstract\n\nThe abstract is the second page of a lab report or APA-format paper and should immediately follow the title page.

Find out which option is the best for you. Table of Contents Techniques Uses Benefits Effectiveness Things to Consider How to Get Started\n\n**What Is Psychoanalytic Therapy?**\n\nPsychoanalytic therapy is a form of talk therapy based on Sigmund Freud's theories of psychoanalysis.\n\nThe approach explores how the unconscious mind influences your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.\n\nSpecifically, it examines how your experiences (often from childhood) may be contributing to your current experience and actions.\n\n**Techniques**\n\nPeople undergoing psychoanalytic therapy often meet with their psychoanalyst at least once a week.\n\nThey can remain in therapy for months or even years.\n\nPsychoanalysts use a variety of techniques to gain insight into your behavior.\n\nSome of the more popular techniques include:\n\n1. Dream interpretation: According to Freud, dream analysis is by far the most important psychoanalytic technique.\n2. Free association: Free association is an exercise during which the psychoanalyst encourages you to freely share your thoughts.\n3. Transference: Talking about these feelings can help your psychoanalyst understand how you interact with others.\n\n**Uses**\n\nPsychoanalytic therapy may be used to treat a number of different psychological conditions, including:\n\n*   Anxiety\n*   Depression\n*   Emotion struggles or trauma\n*   Identity problems\n*   Self-esteem issues\n*   Self-assertion\n*   Psychosomatic disorders\n*   Relationship issues\n*   Self-destructive behavior\n*   Sexual problems\n\n**Benefits**\n\nWhat makes psychoanalytic therapy different from other forms of treatment?\n\nA review of the research comparing psychoanalytic approaches to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) identified seven features that set the psychoanalytic approach apart.\n\n1.  Focuses on emotions.\n2.  Explores avoidance.\n3.  Identifies recurring themes.\n4.  Exploration of past experienced.\n5.  Explores interpersonal relationships.\n6.  Emphasizes the therapeutic relationship.\n7.  Free-flowing.\n\n**Effectiveness**\n\nSuccess often hinges on the ability to confront potentially stressful or triggering experiences.\n\nWhile some critics have derided the success rates of psychoanalytic therapy, research suggests that both long- and short-term psychoanalytic therapy can effectively treat a range of conditions.\n\n*   Symptom Reduction: One review of the effectiveness of long-term psychoanalytic therapies found moderate to large success rates for reducing symptoms of a variety of psychopathologies.\n*   Lasting Improvements: People who receive psychoanalytic treatment tend to retain these gains. Most continue to improve even after therapy ends.\n\n**Things to Consider**\n\nAs with all treatment methods, there are also potential downsides that should be considered.\n\nThis form of therapy tends to require ongoing sessions.\n\nTraditional psychoanalysis could involve three to five sessions a week for several years, however psychoanalysis psychotherapy is less frequent and may be undertaken once to twice a week.\n\nDepending on how long your therapy lasts, the costs can mount up.\n\nPsychoanalytic therapy can also be an intense process. It involves evoking emotional responses and often challenges established defense mechanisms.\n\n**How to Get Started**\n\nIf you think you or someone you love would benefit from psychoanalytic therapy, the first step is to seek out a trained professional.\n\nTo find a qualified psychoanalyst, start by asking your primary care physician for recommendations.\n\nYou can also search the directory available on the American Psychoanalytic Association's website. Friends who have had a good experience with psychoanalytic treatment can also be another good source of recommendations. If you do not have a good referral from someone you know, there are a number of online psychoanalyst networks and directories that can point you in the right direction.\n\nOnce you have identified a potential psychoanalyst, make a call to set up an initial consultation. During this consultation, you can further explore if psychoanalytic therapy is the right approach for you.\n\nPsychoanalytic therapy is just one mental health treatment approach that you may want to consider. Always talk to your doctor or therapist to determine which psychotherapy method might be the most effective for your individual needs.

    "content": "with Us\n\n**Erotomania: Signs, Symptoms, Treatment, and Examples in Pop Culture**\n\n**What Is Erotomania?**\n \nErotomania is a psychiatric disorder characterized by the delusional belief that another person, usually of higher social status, is profoundly in love with the affected individual despite no evidence or reciprocation.1 It's also known as De Clérambault's Syndrome, named after Gaëtan Gatian de Clérambault, a French psychiatrist who extensively studied this condition.\n\n**Historical Background**\n\nGaëtan Gatian de Clérambault was born in the late 19th century and worked tirelessly to understand erotomania. He meticulously studied patients, predominantly women, who exhibited characteristic symptoms of this condition. De Clérambault found that they maintained unshakable beliefs in their imagined romance despite objective evidence to the contrary or the object of affection's denial.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) categorizes erotomania as a type of delusional disorder. The criteria for diagnosing erotomania include:\n\n1.  The presence of delusions lasting one month or longer\n2.  There's no evidence that symptoms could indicate schizophrenia\n3.  There's no marked impairment of daily functioning or obviously odd and bizarre behavior\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nTreating erotomania can be challenging due to the nature of delusional beliefs. Treatment often involves medication, especially antipsychotics, which can help manage delusions and prevent them from getting worse.\n\n*   Therapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), can also be a beneficial add-on to medication.\n*   CBT focuses on identifying and changing thought patterns that can contribute to delusional beliefs.\n\n**Impact of Erotomania**\n\nThe impact of erotomania on a person's life can be devastating. Fixating on the delusional romantic relationship often consumes a significant portion of the person's daily life, leading to neglect of personal responsibilities, including work and relationships.\n\n*   The constant pursuit and obsession can lead to stalking behaviors, which may result in legal issues.\n*   It can also be distressing and potentially dangerous for the person who is the object of the delusional affection. They may feel harassed or threatened. \n\n**Examples in Pop Culture**\n\nSome famous cases of erotomania include:\n\n1.  John Hinckley Jr., who attempted to assassinate President Ronald Reagan, fixated on actress Jodie Foster.\n2.  Mark David Chapman, who murdered John Lennon, was believed to suffer from erotomania.\n3.  The Netflix series 'You' revolves around a character named Joe Goldberg, who becomes obsessed with women he believes are in love with him.\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n*   Does erotomania involve genuine love? No, it involves delusional beliefs about love rather than genuine mutual affection.\n*   Is erotomania always harmful? Yes, erotomania is harmful as it involves delusional thinking and can lead to significant personal, social, and sometimes legal consequences for the person and the object of their obsession. \n*   Can family members help someone with erotomania? While family members can be supportive, it's crucial to encourage a person with erotomania to seek professional help. They need to recognize the severity of the condition and the need for professional intervention. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nUnderstanding, identifying, and treating erotomania is critical to mitigating its potentially devastating effects on the lives of those affected and the people around them. Through medication, therapy, and support, people with erotomania can work towards managing their symptoms and improving their quality of life. \n\n1.
