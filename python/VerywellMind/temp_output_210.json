Health issues or chronic illnesses\n4.  Relationship conflicts or divorce\n5.  Moving to a new home or location\n\nEach of these factors can impact family dynamics, causing stress that can be exacerbated without support and limited resources.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFamily stress theory offers insights into the changes within a family dynamic due to stressful events. Understanding this theory allows families to make more empowered decisions regarding stress, develop coping skills, and cultivate internal and external resources for better outcomes. By implementing strategies like family meetings, scheduling alone time, creating a zen corner, and asking for help, families can navigate stressful times with greater resilience. 17 Benefits of Being an Empathetic Person Table of Contents Why Is Family Stress Theory Important? How to Cultivate Resources During Stressful Times Coping With Family Stress The family stress theory explores the changes within a family dynamic that occur as a result of a stressful event. The theory was developed by sociologist Reuben Hill in 1949. He was particularly interested in how families were impacted by World War II and looked into how war-induced separations and reunifications shifted families. Noticing that the separations and reunions were crises within the family system, he spotted some patterns. He noted how the family's internal and external resources can buffer or exacerbate the stressful event, influencing how the family interprets and makes meaning of the inciting event. All three of these factors combined - the event, available family resources, and the family perception of the event - interact to influence and determine the outcome of the crisis.1 What Are the 5 Top Stressors in Life? Why Is Family Stress Theory Important? Within every family is a family system. This system includes the family members and their roles, beliefs, rules, values, expectations, boundaries, and responses to their environment. Parents are expected to fulfill the role of caregivers, and their children rely upon them for safety, survival, and support. In one family system, parents may fulfill all of the caretaking roles for a child like cooking, cleaning, and getting them ready for school. In another family system, the oldest child may be expected to adopt some caregiving responsibilities, like being assigned the role of watching and caring for their younger siblings when their parents are out of the house working. This is a different role for the child, which impacts the family system. Additionally, a family may have values based on occupational or educational standards. For example, it may be taboo in some families to not attend college, while other families may expect all members to work in a family business or to go to a trade school. Differing values, roles, beliefs, rules, expectations, boundaries, and responses to environmental factors directly impact what causes, exacerbates, and alleviates stress in different family systems.1 What Happens in a Family Unit When an Issue Arises? When a stressful issue arises in a family, the response will range depending on coping, stress management, and parenting skills. A parent may scream and accuse, blame and shame, approach with curiosity and patience, or any number of responses which is heavily dependent upon their internal and external resources:2 Internal resources: Stress and anger management skills, conflict resolution skills, communication skills, the ability to self-regulate, mindfulness, and self-awareness External resources: Financial resources, access to food and medical care, social and communal support, physical or practical assistance, and emotional and psychological support including therapy Understanding this theory offers the opportunity to make more empowered decisions regarding stress. How Family Therapy Works How to Cultivate Resources During Stressful Times Family stress theory states that resources can be pivotal in the outcome of the crisis. However, certain resources are outside a family's control. For example, a family's financial situation or access to meet our basic needs cannot always be controlled. In these situations, you can look at internal resources you can cultivate and external resources you can access.2 Example Scenario No. 1: A Parent Loses Their Job Let's say you are a parent who is a primary provider for your family who loses your job. This will thrust your family into varying levels of crisis depending on your needs, savings, environment, and support system. If you do not have much in savings and are applying for every job you can with no luck, this can cause significant stress that can be exacerbated without support and limited external and internal resources. You notice that you have less emotional availability when parenting and that your children's behavior begins to shift as your temper shortens, mood changes, and own struggles and stress begin to affect the rest of your family. This would be an example of a time to connect with your external resources and reach out for social and community support. Calling upon a family or community member to help with childcare could be instrumental in providing your children care while allowing you the space and time you need to focus on finding a job. This may be challenging for those with limited friendships and community connections, intensifying stress and hardship. Another option for developing and tapping into external resources is exploring community resources. For example, there might be a job",

Block, MD The information on this page is current as of April 2023 and may not reflect the most up-to-date developments or research in psychology. What's This? **Understanding the APA Code of Ethics**\n\nThe American Psychological Association (APA) publishes the Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct which outlines aspirational principles as well as enforceable standards that psychologists should use when making decisions.\n\n*   In 1948, APA president Nicholas Hobbs said, [The APA Code of Ethics] should be of palpable aid to the ethical psychologist in making daily decisions.\n*   The APA Code of Ethics is meant to provide a common set of rules that help ensure mutual safety and patient benefit.\n\n**APA Code of Ethics' 5 Principles**\n\nNot all ethical issues are clear-cut, but the APA offers psychologists guiding principles to help them make sound ethical choices within their profession. The APA Code of Ethics' Five Principles\n\n1.  **Beneficence and Non-Maleficence**: Psychologists should strive to protect the rights and welfare of those with whom they work professionally.\n2.  **Fidelity and Responsibility**: Psychologists have a moral responsibility to help ensure that others working in their profession also uphold high ethical standards.\n3.  **Integrity**: In research and practice, psychologists should never attempt to deceive or misrepresent.\n4.  **Justice**: Mental health professionals have a responsibility to be fair and impartial.\n5.  **Respect for People's Rights and Dignity**: Psychologists should respect the right to dignity, privacy, and confidentiality of those they work with professionally.\n\n**The APA Code of Ethics' Standards**\n\nThe 10 standards found in the APA ethics code are enforceable rules of conduct for psychologists working in clinical practice and academia. The 10 Standards Found in the APA Code of Ethics\n\n1.  **Resolving Ethical Issues**: This standard provides information about what psychologists should do to resolve ethical situations they may encounter in their work.\n2.  **Competence**: Psychologists must practice within their areas of expertise.\n3.  **Human Relations**: Psychologists frequently work with a team of other mental health professionals.\n4.  **Privacy and Confidentiality**: This standard outlines psychologists' responsibilities in maintaining patient confidentiality.\n5.  **Advertising and Other Public Statements**: Psychologists who advertise their services must ensure that they accurately depict their training, experience, and expertise.\n6.  **Record Keeping and Fees**: Maintaining accurate records is an important part of a psychologist's work.\n7.  **Education and Training**: This standard focuses on expectations for behavior when psychologists are teaching or training students.\n8.  **Research and Publication**: This standard focuses on ethical considerations when conducting research and publishing results.\n9.  **Assessment**: Psychologists should obtain informed consent before administering assessments.\n10. **Therapy**: This standard outlines professional expectations within the context of providing therapy.\n\n**What Happens When a Therapist Violates the APA Code of Ethics?**\n\nAfter a report of unethical conduct is received, the APA may censure or reprimand the psychologist, or the individual may have their APA membership revoked. Complaints may be referred to others, including state professional licensing boards. State psychological associations, professional groups, licensing boards, and government agencies may also choose to impose penalties against the psychologist.\n\n**Reporting a Therapist for Unethical Behavior**\n\nIf you would like to file a complaint against a therapist, contact your state's psychologist licensing board.\n\n*   The most significant ethical issues include:\n    *   **Client Welfare**: Given the roles they serve, psychologists often work with individuals who are vulnerable due to their age, disability, intellectual ability, and other concerns.\n    *   **Informed Consent**: Psychologists are responsible for providing a wide range of services in their roles as therapists, researchers, educators, and consultants.\n    *   **Confidentiality**: Therapy requires providing a safe place for clients to discuss highly personal issues without fear of having this information shared with others or made public.\n    *   **Competence**: The training, education, and experience of psychologists is also an important ethical concern. Psychologists must possess the skill and knowledge to properly provide the services that clients need.\n\n**The Big Picture**\n\nAlthough the APA Code of Ethics provides respected principles and enforceable standards for professional conduct, psychology is not free from ethical controversy. For example, debates over psychologists' participation in torture and the use of animals in psychological research remain hot-button ethical concerns. Nevertheless, reputable psychologists commonly turn to the APA Code of Ethics for help with moral and ethical issues and decisions commonly faced in their profession.

    "content": "Last Updated: November 17, 2023 Medically reviewed by Amy Morin, LCSW Verywell Madelyn Goodnight Table of Contents Counseling vs. Psychotherapy Similarities Differences How to Choose For Depression Preparing for a Visit The terms counselor and psychotherapist are often used interchangeably and have many similarities, but there are some important differences as well. In general, counseling is recommended for specific issues and situations, such as addiction or grief, and takes place over weeks to several months. Psychotherapy, in contrast, tends to explore past issues that might be contributing to present day problems. It often takes place continually or intermittently over a period of years. In actual practice, however, there is a great deal of overlap between the two types of therapies. Understanding some more of the differences between counseling and psychotherapy may be helpful in choosing the type of therapy that will be most effective for you as an individual. Get Help Now We've tried, tested, and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, BetterHelp, and ReGain. Find out which option is the best for you. Counseling vs. Psychotherapy While the same therapist may provide both counseling and psychotherapy, psychotherapy generally requires more skill than simple counseling.1﻿ It is conducted by professionals trained to practice psychotherapy such as a psychiatrist or psychologist, a trained counselor, or a social worker. While a psychotherapist is qualified to provide counseling, a counselor may or may not possess the necessary training and skills to provide psychotherapy. That said, a therapist may provide counseling with specific situations and a counselor may function in a psychotherapeutic manner. Counseling Technically speaking, counselor means advisor. It involves two people working together to solve a problem. It is a term that is used in conjunction with many types of advice giving. For example, financial planning and spiritual guidance are both types of counseling. Just about anyone may claim to be a counselor if they are in the role of giving advice. The term counseling may also properly be used to refer to what occurs in a relationship with a psychotherapist. In the context of mental health, counseling is generally used to denote a relatively brief treatment that is focused primarily on behavior. It often targets a particular symptom or problematic situation and offers suggestions and advice for dealing with it. In this setting, the counselor offers guidance and support as the individual figures out ways to better manage life and adjust to change or adversity. There are many types of counselors, such as marriage and family therapists, grief counselors, addiction and substance abuse counselors, and more. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy on the other hand is generally a longer-term treatment that focuses more on gaining insight into chronic physical and emotional problems. Its focus is on the person's thought processes, and how these may be influenced by past events such that they cause problems in the present. In other words, psychotherapy addresses the root cause and core issues of current problems so that lasting change and personal growth may occur. There are several different types of therapy that fall under the general heading of psychotherapy, including approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, psychoanalytic psychotherapy, and much more. The Best Online CBT Services, According to a Therapist Similarities There are many similarities between counseling and psychotherapy, and even with the distinction, counseling often includes some psychotherapy and psychotherapy often includes some counseling. Similarities include: Development of a healing, safe, and therapeutic relationship between a therapist and an individual Effectiveness for a wide range of people, both adults and children Understanding a person's feelings and behaviors, and addressing issues with the goal of improving a person's life Differences While mental health professionals with more advanced degrees (eg. psychology PhD or PsyD) are more likely to provide psychotherapy, the same provider may do both types of therapy. There are some key differences between the providers, however. Counseling Focus on present problems and situations Specific situations or behaviors Short term therapy (for a period of weeks and up to 6 months) Action and behavior focused Talk therapy Guidance, support, and education to help people identify and find their own solutions to current problems Secondary process Psychotherapy Focus on chronic or recurrent problems Overall patterns, big picture oriented Long term therapy, either continuous or intermittent over many years Feeling and experience focused May include testing (such as personality, intelligence), talk therapy, other therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy In-depth focus on internal thoughts feelings (core issues) leading to personal growth Primary process How to Choose Between a Counselor and Psychotherapist When choosing a therapist, it's helpful to learn about the differences noted above, as well as the background of specific providers and the approaches they use. Sometimes the choice will come down to personal preferences, access, or insurance coverage. The most important step, however, is to find a therapist you can trust. In fact, the level of trust a person has in their mental health care practitioner plays the greatest role in whether the therapy will be successful or not. You may actually need to talk with a provider or visit for a few appointments before you know which type of therapy is best for you. For example, with some situations it can be difficult to know if it is a short term, a limited problem you are facing (and thus, may fall under conditions best treated with counseling), or if instead there are events or situations in your past that are leading to the current problem. When You May Wish to See a Counselor Counseling may be a better option than psychotherapy if: 1. You have specific issues or short term problems you wish to address. 2. You wish to learn coping skills to help better manage stress and improve relationships. 3. You are coping with life transitions and adjustments, such as divorce or grief. 4. You are coping with addiction issues. 5. You are looking for someone who is essentially a coach who can guide and support you as you learn to recognize problems and formulate healthy solutions yourself. When You May Wish to See a Psychotherapist A psychotherapist may be a better option if: 1. You have problems that are significantly impacting your life and relationships. 2. You are coping with past trauma, or if you believe situations in the past may be playing a role in your current issues. 3. Your present issues are chronic or recurring concerns. 4. You have a chronic medical condition (such as autoimmune disease, cancer, etc.) that is affecting your emotional well-being. 5. You have a diagnosed mental health condition such bipolar disorder or a major anxiety disorder. How to Find a Therapist Counseling vs. Psychotherapy for Depression Both counseling and psychotherapy are used in the treatment of depression, and the choice can depend on the severity of the depression, whether it is a new issue for you or rather an ongoing or recurrent problem and more. As far as the effectiveness of the two approaches, a 2016 study found that counseling was just as effective for the treatment of previously untreated mild to moderate depression diagnosed in primary care.2﻿ Another 2016 study, however, found that interpersonal psychotherapy was somewhat more beneficial than counseling in adolescents with depression, with respect to both symptoms, and overall functioning over the short-term.3﻿ That said, a 2018 study looking at the same group found that long term, the effects of counseling were more beneficial.4﻿ People with chronic, severe depression might benefit most from psychotherapy",

    "title": "I Needed A Therapist That Could See Me After Work-So I Tried E-Therapy Cafe",
    "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/e-therapy-cafe-online-therapy-review-tried-and-tested-in-2023-8710289",
    "content": "on This Article\n\n**Title**\nI Needed A Therapist That Could See Me After Work-So I Tried E-Therapy Cafe\n\n**Overview**\n\nGetting set up with traditional therapy is very hard.\n\n*   In the past, it has taken me two months to hear back from a therapist about their availability to see me.\n*   Only for me to realize that I couldn't afford the cost (even with health insurance) and I'd have to take time off work to attend the sessions, which was just too complicated and not sustainable.\n\n**The Solution**\n\nSo I started considering online therapy as a way to find more accessible, affordable, and flexible therapy and I found E-Therapy Cafe, a boutique online therapy company that stands out from its (sometimes better-known) competition for its accessibility, affordability, and flexible session times.\n\n**Signing Up for E-Therapy Cafe**\n\nThe website looks a little clunky and busy when you first land on it. There's tons of text on squeezed in on every page-often in different fonts, which can be distracting-and at first glance, the site might even come off as unprofessional. However, it's fairly simple to navigate once you get the hang of it.\n\n*   Halfway down the homepage is a button that says, Take the First Step Now, which takes you to an intake form to fill out on the site.\n*   The initial intake form is rather detailed and includes both multiple choice and short answer responses for questions such as gender, relationship status, current feelings and stress levels, and an open area to discuss what you'd like to get from therapy.\n*   There is also an option on the initial intake form to choose the provider you prefer, rather than being matched with one.\n\n**My Experience**\n\nI got an email from the E-Therapy Cafe Client Portal less than 24 hours after submitting my intake form that included several long-form questions about my past as well as how I cope with things currently. In this email, I also got more information on what I needed in order to participate in E-Therapy Cafe sessions, which was just internet connection, video capability, and a back up video app that could be used in case the link to my therapy session I was sent doesn't work for some reason.\n\n**The Providers**\n\nE-Therapy Cafe employs a small team of 13 providers who are all licensed clinical therapists and expert-level certified life coaches. It's important to note that, while licensed therapists are held to legal licensure standards, coaches-even certified coaches-are not held accountable in this way.\n\n1.  E-Therapy Cafe addresses this issue by only employing coaches who are also licensed therapists, so you know that no matter who you see, they are a licensed professional.\n2.  Each therapist has an extensive bio that includes their areas of expertise, approach, and facts about them, as well as their license state and numbers.\n\n**Cost**\n\nThere are both pay-as-you-go and subscription options at E-Therapy Cafe. Per-session prices are $65 per half-hour session, though you can get a slight discount on your first session (which is considered a Trial) and pay $55.\n\n1.  There are two subscription options:\n    *   ETC Flex (The Monthly Wellness Pack), which is eight online sessions within a month and costs $470 per month ($58.75 per session)\n    *   ETC 90 (The Quarterly Commitment), which is a 90-day pack of 24 sessions and costs $440 per month ($55 per session)\n2.  Additionally, E-Therapy Cafe offers an Emotional Support Animal (ESA) visit for $170, which includes the session, assessment, evaluation, consultation, and prescription if you qualify.\n3.  It also offers an ETC Reflect (Between Session Support) option, which is a digital journal or email chat session with a provider for $65 per 700 words.\n\n**My Therapy Sessions**\n\nAfter scheduling, I got an appointment email reminder that included the link to go to for the session. I was pleased that I able to schedule an appointment approximately 24 hours after I initially signed up for these services-a much quicker turnaround time than with other online therapy companies, and certainly than with most in-person practices.\n\n1.  There are three different ways you can communicate with your therapist (i.e. use a session):\n    *   30-minute video calls\n    *   30-minute instant e-chat sessions\n    *   E-journal entries, which is where you write up to 700 words on how you're feeling or what you're struggling with and get a thoughtful response from your provider within 48 hours.\n2.  The first methods you have to schedule appointment times for. I had a hard time figuring out the e-journal method and never actually got around to doing it as a result, so I opted for the video calls, and it was a good experience.\n\n**Pros and Cons**\n\nI really appreciated and enjoyed my experience with E-Therapy Cafe. It was certainly the most positive therapy experience I've had in my life so far. All that said, the company has its good and bad.\n\n1.  Pros:\n    *   Much more availability than traditional therapy\n    *   Relatively affordable compared to traditional therapy and other companies\n    *   Clinicians with a wide range of expertise\n    *   Detailed provider bio information available\n    *   Ability to choose a preferred provider\n2.  Cons:\n    *   Insurance is not accepted\n    *   No app, so you must use the website\n    *   Sometimes information, such as how to do an e-journal, is difficult to find\n    *   Website is a little clunky and overwhelming\n    *   Therapy services limited to states in which providers are licensed\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nThe best thing about E-Therapy Cafe, in my opinion, is its accessibility. Not only do its providers have availability to see you at nontraditional times, I was also able to pay less than what I would for traditional therapy with my insurance, and I didn't have to miss work or wait for weeks and weeks to hear back.\n\n1.  My provider was also pretty well matched up to what I needed, even though at first I had concerns.\n2.  He was very helpful, and my experience was mostly very positive.\n3.  Most of the negative aspects I noticed had to do with the navigation of the website.\n4.  I think with an app and possibly fixing a few bugs there would be fewer negative aspects to mention.\n\n**E-Therapy Cafe User Survey**\n\nMy positive experience seems to align with other people's experience too. We surveyed 100 current and previous E-Therapy users, and 85% rated E-Therapy as very good or excellent. Ninety-five percent of users stated they were either likely or very likely to recommend the company to others, and 96% were able to find a therapist who met most or all of their needs.\n\n1.  Eighty-eight percent rated their therapist's qualifications as very good or excellent, and 90% would start their search at E-Therapy Cafe again if they needed a new therapist.\n2.  Overall, the quality of the care at E-Therapy Cafe was top notch and I'd personally recommend it to others,",
