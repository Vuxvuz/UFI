    "content": "Last Updated: August 24, 2023 Aron Janssen, MD Dr. Aron Janssen is a board-certified psychiatrist and Assistant Professor in the Departments of Psychiatry and Family Medicine at the University of Central Florida College of Medicine. He has published articles on various topics including mental health stigma, sleep disorders, addiction, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Last Updated: August 24, 2023\n\n**Is Depression Hereditary?**\n\nDepression is a complex condition that can be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. While there may be a heritable component to depression, genetics is not the only determinant. Other factors contribute to risk, while some can be protective.\n\n*   A child who has a parent with depression may have a genetic predisposition but will not necessarily become depressed.\n*   On the other hand, a child who does not have a family member with depression and is not genetically predisposed to the condition may become depressed if they are exposed to a triggering event such as experiencing a trauma.\n\n**The Role of Genetics in Depression**\n\nResearch has demonstrated that genes play a role in the potential risk for many health conditions, including depression. Studies have suggested there is a heritable component to depression. Some research has also indicated that women may be more susceptible to the genetic influences associated with depression than men.\n\n*   When studying depression or other health conditions, researchers often look for changes in genes called variants.\n*   These changes are classified according to the effect (if any) they have on the gene.\n*   Families can often predict what color a child's eyes will be by looking to parents and other close relatives, but variants can behave unexpectedly.\n\n**Understanding Genetic Variations**\n\nHeredity is a complex interplay of many factors, not just individual genes. When studying depression or other health conditions, researchers often look for changes in genes called variants. These changes are classified according to the effect (if any) they have on the gene.\n\n*   Having a genetic variant can make it more likely-but not definitive-that you will develop a condition associated with that variant.\n*   If a gene associated with a specific condition is altered, it may be more (or less) likely to contribute to the development of that condition.\n\n**Can Genetics Affect Mental Health Treatment?**\n\nDepression can be treated with medication, psychotherapy, and other interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Some people may be prescribed a combination of treatments. Your genes may influence how well a specific treatment works for you.\n\n*   Research has indicated that certain genes might affect how well your body absorbs, uses, and excretes alcohol and drugs, including antidepressant medications.\n*   Several genes are known to influence drug metabolism, but the results from these studies are primarily of interest to doctors and researchers.\n\n**Does Heritability of Depression Affect Children?**\n\nPeople with depression might be concerned they will pass on the condition to their children. While there could be a heritable component to depression, genetics is not the only determinant. Other factors contribute to risk, while some can be protective. A child who has a parent with depression may have a genetic predisposition but will not necessarily become depressed.\n\n*   On the other hand, a child who does not have a family member with depression and is not genetically predisposed to the condition may become depressed if they are exposed to a triggering event such as experiencing a trauma. Other known factors that contribute to all forms of depression and other mental health conditions include: brain chemistry changes in brain structure hormone imbalances extreme stress\n\n**Summary**\n\nHaving a genetic predisposition to depression can exacerbate these factors and may influence when someone becomes depressed as well as how long symptoms may last. However, it's essential to remember that depression can develop in anyone-even someone who isn't genetically predisposed and isn't susceptible to known risk factors.\n\n*   Identifying the signs of depression and being able to recognize them in yourself and others is crucial to ensuring the condition doesn't go untreated.\n*   If you or a loved one are struggling with depression, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database.\n\n**Sources**\n\n¹ \"Is Depression Hereditary?\" by Nancy Schimelpfening\n\n² Research studies have suggested that someone with a first-degree relative diagnosed with depression (a parent, sibling, or child) could be three times more likely to be diagnosed with depression in their lifetime compared to the general population. 3 \"Depression and Genetics\" by the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\n³ Some research has also indicated that women may be more susceptible to the genetic influences associated with depression than men. 5 Why Some People Are More Prone to Depression\n\n4 Understanding Genetic Variations \n\n5 Heredity is a complex interplay of many factors, not just individual genes. When studying depression or other health conditions, researchers often look for changes in genes called variants.\n\n6 These changes are classified according to the effect (if any) they have on the gene.\n\n7 Research has identified several genetic variants associated with depression, but no single gene has been definitively linked to the condition.\n\n8 Can Genetics Affect Mental Health Treatment?\n\n9 While some consumer genomic test kits provide information about topics like drug metabolism, genomic testing is not the same as genetic testing. \n\n10 Additional research is needed to understand what findings from genetic studies could mean for antidepressants as well as other medications used to treat depression.\n\n11  Talk to your doctor before using your genomic health information to make decisions about your healthcare, including your depression treatment.\n\n12 Does Heritability of Depression Affect Children? People with depression might be concerned they will pass on the condition to their children. While there could be a heritable component to depression, genetics is not the only determinant. Other factors contribute to risk, while some can be protective.\n\n13 Non-Genetic Causes of Depression Genetics is one of several potential causes of depression. Knowing the possible causes can help you better understand depression, but remember that depression can also develop in the absence of a clear cause and be difficult to pinpoint.\n\n14 Other known factors that contribute to all forms of depression and other mental health conditions include: brain chemistry changes in brain structure hormone imbalances extreme stress\n\n15 Summary Having a genetic predisposition to depression can exacerbate these factors and may influence when someone becomes depressed as well as how long symptoms may last.

According to experts, using meditation as a form of treatment should be in collaboration with your care team and should not be considered a one-stop-shop solution to mental health conditions.\n\nI don't know about you but I initially found meditation incredibly difficult to understand. I have a physical disability and multiple mental health conditions, including depression and an anxiety disorder. Even my physical disability, cerebral palsy, is inherently tied to my brain. Some days, to call me a mess is an understatement, but at least my brain damage is visible on a scan.\n\nIn my mid-20s through five-ish years ago-meditation as a treatment option seemed not just sensible, but inevitable. If everyone else was doing it-even on the Canadian prairies where I live-why wasn't I? However, when I was first asked to try mindfulness meditation, I was at a loss.\n\nWhat do you mean you want me to sit here, and imagine the traffic floating by, and contemplate my thoughts without getting into those imaginary cars? What if I wanted to get into one of those cars? What if they were going somewhere cool? What if the vehicle was self-driving? What if they were going to San Francisco? I'd love to go to San Francisco.\n\nSometimes, my mind would float away to my to-do list, or my day job at the time working at an arts non-profit, or the weather, or anything but the calmness I was supposed to focus on. I eventually did find a mindfulness practice that worked for me, yoga nidra, but that was after many months of trial and error.\n\nHere's hoping this article can help you find a meditation practice for your mental health a little smoother and easier.\n\n**How Meditation Can Help With Depression**\n\nThe causes of depression are complicated and not fully understood, Some point to genetics, others to physiology, and factors such as stress and anxiety. Brent Nelson, MD, adult interventional psychiatrist and chief medical information officer at PrairieCare, says that for him, the focus on the brain is a helpful framework to understand how meditation can help with depression.\n\nThe brain has 100 billion neurons with 100 trillion connections, so it's very complicated, Nelson says. And the cause of depression is still yet to be fully understood, but we know it's a complex process. It's often interleaved with other things such as anxiety or trauma, and really, for a lot of people, is a function of stress meeting, maybe, an underlying genetic predisposition.\n\nMeditation, when used to treat depression, is not isolated on an island. When suggested by a psychologist, a psychiatrist, or a therapist, meditation is often used alongside medications, methodologies like cognitive-behavioral therapy, and treatments like transcranial magnetic stimulation.\n\nNelson tells Verywell Mind that he often starts patients with mindfulness meditations. A lot of times we will start with mindfulness meditation because what it really can let people do is get their brain to be more connected, kind of in the moment, in the here and now, and less so in the distant past or anxiety over the future, which often can be a challenge in depression, he adds.\n\n**What [mindfulness meditation] really can let people do is get their brain to be more connected, kind of in the moment, in the here and now, and less so in the distant past or anxiety over the future, which often can be a challenge in depression.**\n\n- BRENT NELSON, MD\n\nJulie Potiker, a certified mindful self-compassion teacher of the UCSD's Center for Mindfulness believes that meditation is a key reason why she was able to recover from her bouts with depression.\n\nIt's not at all like loosey-goosey or woo woo, or anything like that... I used to be a clinically depressed person, and I used to take antidepressants, and I had postpartum depression, so I'm really a poster child for this...Mindful self-compassion, that's what I leaned into, and that's why I became a teacher of it, and then that's why I became certified in it, she says.\n\n**How to Fight Depression Without Medication**\n\n**How to Get Started**\n\nPotiker, who tends to focus initially on a loving-kindness meditation, says that zeroing in on self-compassion and gratitude can be especially valuable for those facing depression, in her experience. In terms of getting started, her recent advice to someone she supports-rather than building up meditation to be a big burdensome practice-was to start small.\n\nI talked to her about little micro-moments, trying to do it once an hour, Potiker explains. Where you either look out the window or you take a walk, or you play one of your favorite songs, or something that makes your body feel good, and you enrich it and absorb it for moments, I don't mean minutes, and you just really feel because it just folds right into gratitude.\n\n**8-Minute Video Meditation to Becoming More Mindful**\n\n**What Types of Meditation Work Best**\n\nA 2015 analysis looked at seven different meditation techniques and their effectiveness. Those included:\n\n1.  Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy\n2.  Patañjali Yoga\n3.  Qigong\n4.  Sahaj Yoga\n5.  Inner Resources Meditation\n6.  Sudarshan Kriya Yoga\n7.  Tai Chi\n\nNelson says that, when in doubt, patients should refer back to the medical professionals supporting them. He says this can include asking your care team about local resources, including regional centers tied to local universities that are studying and implementing meditation strategies for those with mental health disorders.\n\nIt's always going back to your treatment team, and having a multi-specialty treatment team that can really look at this particular unique individual from a few different perspectives and help give good, reliable guidance, Nelson adds.\n\n**How You Should Meditate, According to Your Personality**\n\n**Tips for Meditation Success**\n\nMeditation can help mitigate depression symptoms when used in conjunction with a professional treatment plan. Here are some tips to get the most out of your practice:\n\n*   Speak to a professional: Meditation is only a smaller part of a broader care plan including medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes.\n*   Make sure you are working with an accredited and recommended practitioner.\n*   Focus on something you can sustain: You don't need to have a perfect meditation practice and it may take time to find the right type of meditation that works for you.\n*   Make sure you're in a safe space: If you're triggered by the type of meditation you are doing, and if you feel unsafe, find a way to self-regulate. This might look like leaving the session, getting a drink of water, or trying an entirely different type of meditation.\n\n**",

    "content": "on This Article 1. Elena Touroni PhD. Consultant Psychologist & Co-Founder of The Chelsea Psychology Clinic, London. Interviewed by Adam England on September 25, 2024. 2. Gin Lalli BSc HPD DSFH Solutions-Focused Therapist and Coach. Interviewed by Adam England on September 23, 2024. 3. Sham Singh MD Psychiatrist at WINIT Clinic. Interviewed by Adam England on September 28, 2024.\n\n**Coping When You Have Both**\n\nIt's common for depression and anxiety to co-exist, and having both can be more difficult for us to cope with than having just one or the other-though it's different for everyone.\n\nMedication, therapy, and lifestyle changes can all help us cope.\n\n### Medication\n\n*   Medication can be useful, but it can differ from person to person.\n*   I never got on with medication really-Zoloft (sertraline) made my depression ten times worse, it felt like, Elisha explains.\n*   Lee, 25, meanwhile, has tried various medications, and has been on Effexor (venlafaxine) for just over a year.\n*   They've upped the dosage a few times now and I now take it three times a day, she says.\n*   They haven't managed to find something that works for my anxiety yet, but I've found if I can manage the depression then that has a knock-on effect and I don't struggle so much with the anxiety.\n\n### Therapy\n\n*   Dr Touroni advises seeking professional support to address both depression and anxiety holistically.\n*   She advises developing your own 'toolkit' of coping mechanisms, which might comprise a mix of therapy, lifestyle changes, and perhaps medication.\n*   Many of her clients have found cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) useful because:\n    *   It addresses both anxiety and depression by helping to challenge negative thought patterns and manage overwhelming emotions.\n*   Sham Singh, MD, a psychiatrist at WINIT Clinic, says, In dealing with anxiety and depression, I look at their underlying causes, which might be emotional or environmental, but at times even biological.\n*   This comprehensive approach will help not only in relieving symptoms but also in preventing their recurrence.\n\n### Lifestyle Changes\n\n*   Making lifestyle changes can also help-for Lee, keeping routines is helpful for anxiety.\n*   There's less chance of getting anxious if I know what's going to happen; but on the flip side, it makes it worse if something unexpected happens, she explains.\n*   You may decide to try mindfulness and grounding techniques yourself, too, whether they're things you've explored in therapy or not.\n*   Dr. Touroni describes them as being incredibly helpful in managing anxiety, letting us focus on the present rather than spiraling into worrying about the future.\n*   She also recommends setting small, achievable goals for depression-take one step at a time, celebrate any wins no matter how small, and recognize the progress you're making.\n\n### Physical Activity\n\n*   Physical activity can help reduce anxiety and boost your mood, so even going for a short walk, if you feel up to it, can help.\n*   While Morgan is on medication for her anxiety and depression, she does this too.\n*   I thrive on keeping routines, making set times to do things I love, and giving myself plenty of grace.\n*   I tackle one thing my depression wants me to avoid every day, like cleaning my room, to stop myself from getting too anxious.\n\n### Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Depression and Anxiety\n\n1.  Address both anxiety and depression by helping to challenge negative thought patterns and manage overwhelming emotions.\n2.  Focus on the present rather than spiraling into worrying about the future.\n3.  Set small, achievable goals for depression-take one step at a time, celebrate any wins no matter how small, and recognize the progress you're making.\n\n### How To Talk To People About It (If You Want To)\n\nTalking to people about our depression and anxiety isn't always easy-often, people might just not be able to relate, even if they mean well.\n\n*   If you do decide to talk to people in your life, like friends, about depression and anxiety, it's fine to bring it up in conversation, or ask them if you'd be able to have a conversation with them.\n*   Of course, it's easier said than done, and I've often struggled to reach out-particularly because I internalized ideas that men are meant to be 'strong' and not discuss their feelings\n*   Reaching out and talking to people is often the first step.\n*   We can often be pleasantly surprised with how our loved ones react.\n*   And if you don't feel able to talk to people in your life, you may find support online from people going through the same thing as us.\n\n### What to Do When You Need Someone to Talk To\n\nMost importantly, seeking support-whether through therapy, support groups, or talking to loved ones-is key to not feeling isolated in this struggle, says Dr. Touroni.\n\n*   Dr Singh says that he encourages his clients to be patient with themselves - and again, that any progress is great.\n*   That, combined with therapy and proper self-care routines such as regular exercise and sleep, can go a long way toward recovery, he says.\n\nWhile living with depression and anxiety concurrently can be a real struggle, there are ways to cope, whether that's opening up to loved ones, making lifestyle changes if we're able to, or trying therapy or medication. It's different for everybody, so it's a good idea for us to try out different coping mechanisms and strategies to find something that works.\n\nAnxiety vs. Depression Symptoms and Treatment Read More: CONDITIONS A-Z DEPRESSION LIVING WITH 3 Sources See Our Editorial Process Meet Our Review Board Share Feedback on This Article 1.

By understanding the relationship between these two conditions, seeking support, and trying different coping mechanisms, individuals can find ways to manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.\n\nIt's essential to remember that everyone's journey is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. Be patient with yourself, and don't be afraid to seek help when you need it. With the right support and strategies, you can learn to live with depression and anxiety and find a sense of hope and healing.\n\n**References**\n\n1.  Elena Touroni PhD.

People who struggle with eating disorders often become preoccupied with food and their body weight.\n\nThese conditions can be life-threatening if left untreated. Additionally, eating disorders often occur together with other mental health issues like depression, anxiety, panic disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorders.\n\nWithout treatment, eating disorders can cause a number of health-related problems including cardiovascular issues, gastrointestinal issues, and malnutrition. However, with proper treatment, people affected by eating disorders can resume healthy eating habits and can improve their mental health.\n\n**IMPACT OF EATING DISORDERS**\n\n*   What to Do If Your Teen Shows Signs of Bulimia\n*   Why Do Some People Get Eating Disorders?\n*   How Is Anorexia Nervosa Diagnosed?\n*   What to Know About Anorexia in Men\n\n**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**\n\nCould you have an eating disorder? Determining if you have an eating disorder begins with examining your thoughts and behaviors surrounding food, body image, and body weight.\n\nAlthough there is an extensive list of warning signs, not everyone will display every symptom. If you suspect you have an eating disorder, it's essential to talk to your doctor or a mental health professional.\n\nThe chance for recovery increases the sooner an eating disorder is addressed. Learn More: Symptoms of Eating Disorders\n\nWhat causes eating disorders? Eating disorders are complex disorders that stem from a variety of factors including genetics, cultural ideals, environmental, psychological, and biological influences.\n\nThese risk factors may also include mental health conditions like anxiety and depression along with body image issues. Learn More: Causes of Eating Disorders\n\nHow can you help someone with an eating disorder? To help a loved one with an eating disorder, be supportive of their recovery efforts without trying to fix, control, or counsel them.\n\nInstead, be patient and encouraging. Empower them to tackle their disordered eating and talk to a counselor or therapist. Are eating disorders genetic? There is some evidence that eating disorders are heritable.\n\nIn fact, in one study of twins, researchers discovered that 40% to 60% of the risk for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder arises from genetic influences. However, the development of an eating disorder is a complex process impacted by various factors and not just about genetic influences.\n\nLearn More: What Causes an Eating Disorder?\n\n**KEY TERMS**\n\n*   Anorexia Nervosa\n*   Bulimia Nervosa\n*   Binge-Eating Disorder\n*   Rumination Disorder\n*   Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder\n*   Psychological Evaluation\n*   Family-Based Therapy\n*   Cognitive Behavioral Therapy\n\n**ANOREXIA NERVOSA**\n\nAnorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by not eating enough and impacts all areas of a person's life. A person affected by anorexia nervosa may have a low body weight and a distorted body image.\n\nThey also may have an intense fear of gaining weight and often use extreme measures to control their weight and shape. Warning Signs of Anorexia Nervosa\n\n**BULIMIA NERVOSA**\n\nBulimia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating followed by purging or another method designed to prevent weight gain such as the use of laxatives, excessive exercises, and fasting.\n\nDue to guilt and shame associated with bulimia nervosa, people affected by this disorder will go to great lengths to hide their behaviors. Signs and Symptoms of Bulimia Nervosa\n\n**BINGE-EATING DISORDER**\n\nBinge eating is an eating disorder characterized by consuming large amounts of food even when the person isn't hungry.\n\nTypically, the person feels out of control as well as a sense of shame and guilt over their binge eating. Unlike people with bulimia nervosa, they do not try to purge the food after it is consumed. What Is Binge Eating?\n\n**RUMINATION DISORDER**\n\nRumination disorder is an eating disorder that involves bringing previously chewed or previously swallowed food back up in order to spit it out or re-swallow it.\n\nThese behaviors are often done in secret because of a fear of what people will think. What Is Rumination Disorder?\n\n**AVOIDANT RESTRICTIVE FOOD INTAKE DISORDER**\n\nARFID is an eating disorder in which the person affected has a strong preference for a narrow range of foods and may refuse to eat any food that is outside of these parameters.\n\nUnlike other eating disorders, people with ARFID do not worry about weight gain or body composition. Understanding Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder\n\n**PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION**\n\nDuring a psychological evaluation, a psychologist or therapist will use a variety of tests and assessments to measure and observe a person's thoughts and behaviors.\n\nAt the completion of a psychological evaluation, the psychologist will make a diagnosis and recommend treatment options. How Eating Disorders Are Diagnosed\n\n**FAMILY-BASED THERAPY**\n\nSometimes referred to as the Maudsley Method, family-based therapy (FBT) is the leading treatment option for treating adolescents with eating disorders.\n\nFBT involves the whole family and primarily takes place in outpatient settings. It is the fastest and most effective treatment for children, adolescents, and young adults.\n\nFamily-Based Therapy for Eating Disorders\n\n**COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY**\n\nCBT is a type of treatment that focuses on helping a person learn how to identify destructive behaviors and thought processes.\n\nThrough CBT, a person's thoughts and behaviors are challenged and replaced with more realistic thoughts and behaviors.

    "content": "About This Article\n\n**Title**\nAn Overview of Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)\n\n**Overview**\nPersistent depressive disorder (PDD), formerly known as dysthymia, is a mood disorder characterized by a milder but more chronic form of depression. It reflects a spectrum of severity that can range from mild to severe.\n\n*   This diagnosis represents a prolonged state of depression with fewer symptoms than major depressive disorder (MDD).\n*   The symptoms are long-lasting and may be attributed to being stuck in a rut rather than as symptoms of a treatable condition.\n\n**Symptoms of Persistent Depressive Disorder**\nThe symptoms of PDD are very similar to MDD, but there is a wider range of symptoms available on the criteria list for MDD. To receive a diagnosis of PDD, you must have at least three of the following seven symptoms:\n*   A sad or depressed mood nearly every day.\n*   Changes in appetite (poor appetite or overeating).\n*   Sleep difficulties (too little or too much sleep).\n*   Lack of energy or fatigue.\n*   Poor self-esteem.\n*   Hopelessness or feeling stuck in a rut.\n*   Trouble concentrating or difficulty making decisions.\n\n**Timeframe of Persistent Depressive Disorder**\nThe symptoms of PDD are chronic, meaning that people experience a depressed mood for most days for a period of at least two years. The timeframe has been reduced to one year for children and teens.\n\n**Age of Onset**\nPDD may have an earlier onset than MDD, with symptoms first appearing during the childhood, teen, or young adult years.\n\n**Causes of Persistent Depressive Disorder**\nLike other forms of depression, the exact cause of PDD is not known. However, a number of factors are believed to play a role, including:\n\n*   Temperament\n*   Environmental factors (e.g., parental loss or separation, childhood adversity, prolonged stress, grief, major life changes, and trauma)\n*   Genetics\n*   Brain chemistry\n\n**Confirming a Diagnosis of PDD**\nThere is no laboratory test for diagnosing dysthymia or any other form of depression. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, your doctor will evaluate your symptoms and medical history.\n\n**Treatment for Persistent Depressive Disorder**\nThe treatments for PDD are similar to those for other forms of depression. Generally, a combination of psychotherapy and medications is the most effective.\n\n*   Talk therapy: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT)\n*   Medications: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)\n\n**Coping With Persistent Depressive Disorder**\nThere are a number of different things that people can do to help cope with persistent depression. Some things that you can do include:\n\n*   Avoiding alcohol and other substances\n*   Creating daily routines that help structure and balance your day\n*   Eating a healthy diet\n*   Establishing a consistent sleep schedule\n*   Getting regular exercise several times each week\n*   Leaving the house and making plans with friends\n*   Practicing stress management techniques such as journaling, taking a walk, and deep breathing\n\n**Conclusion**\nEven very mild symptoms of depression can disrupt your ability to function and enjoy life, particularly when these symptoms are long-lasting. Fortunately, there are effective treatments available for persistent depressive disorder that can make a major difference in your health and well-being. Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling to explore the treatment options that are right for you. 7 Sources 7. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-about-ptsd/201808/the-long-term-effects-depression-is-this-you-in-10-years, The Long-Term Effects of Depression: Is This You in 10 Years?

Bipolar I disorder involves episodes of severe mania and often depression. Bipolar II disorder involves a less severe form of mania called hypomania.1 There is also a third type known as cyclothymic disorder. Research suggests that around 4.4% of U.S. adults will have bipolar disorder at some point in their lives.2 Genetics are thought to play a significant role, although brain abnormalities and environmental factors also contribute as causes of bipolar disorder.\n\nMood stabilizers are usually the first-line treatment, but electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be used to address severe symptoms.\n\n**LIVING WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER**\n\n5 Movies That Portray What It's Like to Have Bipolar Disorder\nSpeaking to a Loved One With Bipolar Disorder\nWhat It Really Feels Like to Live With Bipolar Disorder\nCould Your Child Have Bipolar Disorder?\n\n**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**\n\n*   What causes bipolar disorder?
