    "title": "How You Should Meditate, According to Your Personality",
    "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/meditation-personality-8667853",
    "content": "on This Article\n\n**How You Should Meditate, According to Your Personality**\n\n**Can Meditation Work for All Personality Types?**\n\nAt its core, meditation is about observing your thoughts without judgment and staying present.\n\n*   It helps build emotional regularity and a healthier relationship with your mind so that you're not a victim to every negative or hurtful thought that passes.\n*   However, meditation is not a one-size-fits-all technique.\n*   How you meditate relies on your personality.\n\n**Choosing a Practice Based On Your Meditation Personality**\n\nThere's no exact science to find the best meditation technique for your personality.\n\nBecause, truly, how you meditate is a personal decision.\n\nBut if you're a newbie to meditation and are unsure where to start-and which practice works best-we found the best meditation technique for every personality type.\n\n**For Introverts: Mindfulness Meditation**\n\nIntroverts harness energy in their alone time and expend energy in social situations.\n\nAs such, they may enjoy mindfulness meditation in a quiet, calm, and familiar setting.\n\n*   Mindfulness meditation involves paying attention to the present moment and focusing on the breath, body sensations, and sounds.\n*   It reduces stress, enhances self-awareness, and improves emotional regulation and mental clarity.\n\n**For Extroverts: Group Meditation**\n\nExtroverts thrive in the hustle and bustle of the world and fuel themselves through social interactions.\n\nThat said, they still benefit from the calming and grounding effects of meditation but in a group or class setting.\n\n*   Group meditation involves meditating alongside others, usually in an in-person or virtual class aided by an instructor.\n*   Along with the therapeutic benefits, this group meditation fosters community and can deepen an extrovert's meditation experience through collective energy.\n\n**For Creatives: Artful Meditation**\n\nCreative people are often drawn to making things, be it painting, drawing, coloring, sewing, or beyond.\n\nThere's something innately therapeutic about diving into an art project for this personality type, and engaging in creative activities can help focus their mind and help them forget outside stressors.\n\n*   Artful meditation, or meditative art, fuses this creativity with mindfulness.\n*   It involves engaging in artistic activities like drawing, painting, or coloring while maintaining a meditative focus on the process.\n*   The form of practice boosts relaxation, provides an opportunity for self-expression, and encourages mindfulness.\n\n**For Music Lovers: Sound Baths**\n\nThose drawn to music appreciate the combination of sounds coming together to create harmonies, rhythms, and vibrations.\n\nIf that resonates with you, then consider sound baths, which can provide a deeply immersive and emotional experience.\n\n*   A sound bath is a meditative experience where participants are bathed in sound waves produced by instruments like gongs, singing bowls, and chimes.\n*   Research has found that vibrations help reduce stress, improve emotional well-being, and enhance mental clarity.\n\n**For Type A Personalities: Breathwork Meditation**\n\nType A personalities are always striving for order and are quick to accomplish any goal before them.\n\nThis often leads them to burnout and perfectionism.\n\nMeditation can help assuage these pitfalls, particularly breathwork meditation.\n\n*   This meditation method focuses on controlling and manipulating breath to calm our bodies, minds, and emotional states.\n*   It's also very structured and orderly, which can appeal to type A people.\n\n**For Type B Personalities: Walking Meditation**\n\nType B personalities are pretty relaxed, easy-going, patient, and adaptable.\n\nThey benefit from flexible and open-ended practices that allow for exploration and creativity.\n\nAnd walking meditation-either through nature or around the block-offers exactly that.\n\n*   Walking meditation combines movement with mindfulness, focusing on the sensations of walking, such as the feel of the ground underfoot and the rhythm of the steps.\n*   It can also create a deeper connection with one's surroundings as you walk through the landscape.\n\n**For Pessimists: Loving-Kindness Meditation**\n\nPessimists typically have a glass half empty mentality as they navigate life, often focusing on the downsides versus the positives.\n\nWhile this arguably realistic point of view isn't all bad, it's important to find the beauty in yourself and the world around you.\n\n*   Enter: Loving-Kindness Meditation.\n*   This form of meditation involves cultivating feelings of compassion, kindness, and goodwill toward yourself and others.\n*   For pessimists-who may struggle with negative self-talk and skepticism towards others-loving-kindness meditation offers a structured practice to cultivate positive emotions and empathy.\n\n**For Optimists: Affirmation Meditation**\n\nBy their very nature, optimists tend to see the brighter side of situations, expecting favorable outcomes and maintaining a hopeful attitude.\n\nFor them, affirmation meditation is a form of meditation that can help reinforce their positive beliefs and further cultivate that optimism.\n\n*   Affirmation meditation involves repeating positive statements aloud or silently.\n*   These may be phrases like I am capable, I attract positive experiences, or I trust in my ability to overcome challenges.\n*   By consciously affirming uplifting statements, optimists strengthen their positive mindset, enjoy a nice boost to their self-esteem, and sustain their natural inclination towards seeing possibilities and opportunities.\n\n**For the Easily Distracted: Guided Meditation**\n\nIf you find it difficult to sit still or are easily distracted, you may get the most bang out of a guided meditation.\n\nThis structured approach allows you to show up and follow instructions.\n\n*   In guided meditation, a narrator guides the practitioner through the meditation, often focusing on relaxation, visualization, or specific themes like gratitude or compassion.\n*   Guided voice meditation provides a clear framework and can be easier to follow, making it accessible for people new to meditation or those who find it difficult to focus on their own. **Final Thoughts**\n\nUltimately, the best type of meditation for you is the one that you personally enjoy and benefit from practicing.\n\nTry a few different types and see what feels right.\n\nYou may also find that having a few variations in your back pocket allows you to keep things varied in your day-to-day life. **How Long Should You
