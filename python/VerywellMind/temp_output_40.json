    "content": "**The Verywell Mind 25**\n\nThe 25 Thought Leaders, Experts, and Advocates Who Are Making a Difference\n\nBy Team Verywell Mind Published on May 01, 2024\n\nIt's Mental Health Awareness Month, and we're back for our second-annual-and highly anticipated-Verywell Mind 25, where we recognize the individuals who are using their platforms to help reduce stigma, serve their communities, and make a difference in the mental health space.\n\nThese selected leaders make up a diverse group of community organizers, influential advocates, experts, and thought leaders who are enacting positive change in their own unique way. How We Chose the Winners\n\nFinalists were first nominated by our readers (yes, you all!), members of the Verywell Mind expert review board-which is comprised of over 20 accredited specialists in the fields of psychology, psychiatry and mindfulness-and the Verywell Mind editorial team.\n\nWinners were then voted on by a panel of nine expert judges who used the following criteria to make their choices: quality and accuracy of content and work, mental health credentials and lived experiences, reach, and alignment with Verywell Mind's core values. The final list of winners celebrates people who are actively moving the conversation about mental health forward in a meaningful way-whether it's in their community or for a wider audience.\n\nWithout further ado, meet this year's 25 winners and join us in celebrating their ongoing contributions to the world of mental health.\n\n**Taraji P. Henson**\n\nActress, Co-Founder of Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation, Entrepreneur, Author\n\nA few things come to mind when you think of Taraji P. Henson-award-winning actress, haircare entrepreneur, and author. Now, add a mental health activist to the list. The Empire actor has been working to destigmatize mental health in the Black community since 2018 when she co-founded the Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation (BLHF).\n\nNamed after her father, Boris Lawrence, the foundation aims to help Black folks access cognitive care by offering free therapy sessions and scholarship funds, plus a host of other programs, including this year's fundraiser and mixer, the Can We Talk? Symposium event.\n\nMy foundation has been chipping away at that mistrust by offering culturally relevant, barrier-free services in traditional trusted spaces like barbershops, HBCU campuses, and with providers and practitioners who practice cultural humility. Mental health advocacy is more than a passion project for Henson-her work is directly inspired by her experience growing up with her father, who was a Vietnam war veteran with untreated mental health issues.\n\nThis difficult upbringing moved her to not only create the foundation in her father's name but also speak to Congress about Black youth suicide rates and launch a Facebook Watch series dedicated to having open conversations around Black mental health. It's these many accomplishments that moved us to name Henson as one of this year's Verywell Mind 25.\n\n**Dr. Judith Joseph**\n\nPsychiatrist, Media Consultant, Content Creator\n\nDr. Judith Joseph is a board-certified psychiatrist with expertise in everything from women's health to child and adolescent psychiatry to serious mental illness. Not only that, but she is also an award-winning mental health content creator, with more than one million followers on social media.\n\nShe is on the medical board of the national non-profit Let's Talk Menopause, an organization focused on destigmatizing menopause so that women can get the information they need and the healthcare they deserve (two things this country has consistently failed to provide). Dr. Joseph also runs an unprecedented clinical lab, comprised of 10 female researchers, that studies high-functioning mental health conditions, such as high-functioning depression, bipolar disorder, ADHD, OCD, PTSD, and schizophrenia-the first lab to ever do so.\n\nHer incredibly popular social media posts focus on the mental health topics researched in her lab, and make difficult subjects like trauma approachable and accessible. Dr. Joseph stood out to us for her social media content that makes mental health education easy and fun and for her work taking the misunderstanding and discrimination out of menopause.\n\n**Phil Schermer**\n\nFounder and CEO of Project Healthy Minds\n\nWith a background in both finance and politics, Phil Schermer knows a thing or two about stress. In October 2020, while the entire world struggled through the COVID-19 pandemic, Schermer launched Project Healthy Minds with the goal of attacking a problem that has only increased since then-the high barriers between millions of people and access to necessary mental healthcare.\n\nSchermer's stated mission, then, is to combine technology and industry with a Gen-Z Millennial sensibility to reshape how we access mental health help. His organization created a free mental health marketplace to quickly connect users with the resources they need when they need them most.\n\nFrom wellness exercises to therapy providers and educational resources across the mental health spectrum, Schermer's organization is growing into a mental health force to be reckoned with. Kenneth Cole Fashion Designer, Activist, Founder of The Mental Health Coalition Kenneth Cole Productions Kenneth Cole is known for his iconic shoes and clothing. However, in addition to making people look good, he also advocates for making them feel mentally well.\n\nIn October 2019, Cole announced the formation of The Mental Health Coalition (MHC), which aims to spread awareness about mental health. We're [not] going to continue to make any meaningful progress until we can make it easier to talk about these circumstances. We are appreciative that we have been able to find a voice that helps do it in some way.\n\nIn 2023, Cole collaborated with Sesame Workshop to raise awareness around children's emotional well-being. He designed a collection of T-shirts, hoodies, and sneakers featuring Oscar the Grouch, Cookie Monster, Elmo, and the Count. Each design features a unique message about mental health and the importance of being open and honest about feelings.\n\nHis coalition's most recent initiative, SOS (Safe Online Standards) for Kids' Mental Health, aims to establish safe online standards for kids' mental health for the first time ever. While Cole believes that the mental health crisis in the United States is possibly one of the biggest of our time, he is inspired to keep making a difference through the MHC.

Dr. Judy Blume is one of America's most beloved authors and a leading voice on children's mental health. Her books have been read by millions around the world and have helped many young people navigate life's challenges.\n\nAs an author, Blume has written extensively about topics like divorce, puberty, sex, and loss. But she didn't stop there: in 2019, Dr. Blume joined forces with her daughter, Amy Friedman, to create a book titled Here for It: A Young Person's Guide to Sexual Health and Relationships.\n\nHere for It is an invaluable resource that demystifies the complexities of relationships and sex for young people. By providing accurate information, guidance, and empathy, Dr. Blume's work continues to inspire confidence in this generation of young readers.\n\nHer passion for mental health advocacy extends beyond her writing: she has also been a long-time advocate for the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and the Child Mind Institute",

Buddhist philosophy is closely related to meditation because they believe in using mindfulness to break out of the cycle of endless suffering to attain enlightenment.\n\nBuddhism is commonly defined as including Southeast Asian Theravada Buddhism, East Asian Mahayana Buddhism, Indo-Tibetan Mahayana, and Vajrayana Buddhism. To those who practice it, Buddhist meditation is a way of life and works to nurture a healthy relationship with the mind.\n\nBelow are a few of the core principles of Buddhist meditation:\n\n*   **Mindfulness**: Fully inhabit the present moment, recognizing that 'now' is all we truly have.\n*   **Impermanence**: I stress the importance of acknowledging impermanence, which allows us to appreciate each moment without clinging to it. It is futile to hold onto shifting, changing elements in a transient world.\n*   **Compassion**: Foster a loving and kind attitude towards all beings, including ourselves.\n*   **Suffering**: Buddhist meditation recognizes suffering as an inherently universal concept because of our desire for attachment and asserts we can end our suffering by freeing ourselves from the never-ending loop of hypnotic, unhelpful desires that do not serve us.1\n*   **Non-self**: The non-self principle challenges the belief that we have a permanent, unchanging soul. Buddhists believe we have a constant, changing self and to find that it involves releasing desires, finding compassion, and meditating.\n\n**Different Techniques and Practices of Buddhist Meditation**\n\nWithin Buddhist meditation, various forms offer practitioners numerous pathways to explore and expand their minds. These practices complement one another, serving as necessary components to cultivating compassion, wisdom, and deep understanding.\n\nThese can be done in a meditation posture that gives you a comfortable but alert state that doesn't hurt your back or knees, which includes kneeling, lying down, cross-legged, sitting in a chair, or standing up. Complete the meditations in a quiet place, indoors or outside.\n\nHere are a few popular examples of Buddhist meditation:\n\n*   **Samatha Meditation**: One of the main kinds of Theravada meditation, Samatha aims for calm concentration to find internal peace by letting go of desires and cravings.3 Sit in a relaxed posture, bring your hands to your lap or at your knees, and then bring full awareness to the normal pattern of your breath without manipulation.\n*   **Vipassana Meditation**: Vipassana meditation, one of the other main kinds of Theravada meditation, aims for inner insight and to see things as they really are.4 Through self-observation without attachment, the meditator can deconstruct the illusions behind the ego and explore different aspects of existence such as impermanence, dissatisfaction, and non-self.\n*   **Metta Meditation**: Metta meditation",

Read more about Armeen Poor MD Table of Contents How to Meditate at Home Types of Meditation You Can Try at Home Benefits of Meditation Meditation is an ancient practice that involves focusing the mind. It increases awareness, promotes relaxation, reduces stress and anxiety, and improves well-being. It also offers benefits for your physical health.1 If you want to begin meditating, your home is a great place to start, says Steph Strauss, a certified yoga instructor and meditation teacher. This article explores the types of meditation you can try, the benefits of at-home meditation, and tips on how to begin meditating at home.\n\n**How to Meditate at Home**\n\nFind a Cozy Spot\n----------------\n\nFind a cozy area in your home without a lot of distractions. This could be anywhere-your favorite chair, your couch, a corner in your home, your bedroom, or on your bed. You can lay down, if you prefer; however, staying seated can help prevent you from falling asleep-you should ideally be relaxed but alert. It is helpful to meditate in the same spot every day, if possible. This helps your brain create a new healthy habit.\n\nSet a Daily Reminder\n-------------------\n\nIt is helpful to set a reminder to meditate at the same time every day. This can help you build a long-lasting habit.\n\nTake Baby Steps\n----------------\n\nIt takes a lot of practice and patience to focus your attention on one thing at a time. So, taking baby steps when you are just starting is recommended. Try shorter meditations at first and work your way up to longer ones. There is no set time frame after which you should start doing longer meditations; it varies from person to person. So, respect your journey and take as much time as you need.\n\nTry Different Types of Meditation\n----------------------------------\n\nThere are endless types of meditation and what might work best for one person may not work for another at all, and that is just fine. Take some time to explore the different types of meditation and see what is most helpful to you.\n\nBe Kind to Yourself\n----------------------\n\nWhile the practice of meditation is quite simple, it is not easy, nor does it get any easier with time. There will be days when the mind is calmer, times it won't stop yacking, or times when it is somewhere in between. This is normal. It's important to meet yourself where you are in that moment and accept what is present with kindness.\n\n**Types of Meditation You Can Try at Home**\n\nLoving Kindness\n----------------\n\nThis practice is a great way to cultivate compassion for yourself and others. Loving kindness meditations open your heart and help you see how interconnected we all are. In this form of meditation, you are guided to offer different people in your life-yourself, someone close to you, someone neutral, someone you're having difficulty with, and all beings everywhere-loving blessings through a series of phrases. You might say something like: May you be healthy. May you be happy. May you be safe. May you live with ease.\n\nBody Scan\n------------\n\nThis practice is a great way to strengthen your mind-body connection. We aren't taught to notice sensations in the body; however, we can learn a lot when we pay attention to the body. In body scan meditations, you are often guided through a gentle scan of your body from the top of your head to your feet. You will soon notice common areas where you tend to hold tension in the body and will be offered tools to help the body and nervous system relax.\n\nFocused Attention\n-------------------\n\nOne of the most common meditation practices is focused attention. This form of meditation involves placing your awareness on one thing, like your breath, sounds in your environment, a phrase, a candle, or your body. When you start to focus your attention on that one thing, you will soon notice how quickly the mind takes over and brings you into thought. This is normal. When this happens, give yourself credit for noticing and return to your anchor of attention. Bring the mind back as many times as it wanders.\n\n**Benefits of Meditation**\n\nReduces stress and anxiety: Meditation teaches you tools that bring your attention to the present moment without judgment, instead of ruminating about something that happened in the past or worrying about something that hasn't happened yet in the future.2\n\nStrengthens relationships: Meditation helps you cultivate more compassion and patience toward all beings, not just the closest ones to you.\n\nIncreases productivity and creativity: Have you ever had a great idea pop into your head while showering or brushing your teeth? The practice of meditation increases your ability to be productive and creative when you give yourself time to pause and breathe.3\n\nImproves heart health: Meditation can improve heart health by lowering your blood pressure, reducing stress, helping you quit smoking, and helping with other markers of heart disease, such as insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.4\n\nBoosts your immune system: The practice of meditation helps strengthen your mind-body connection. Meditation, in turn, enables you to listen to your body's feedback and teaches you how to self-regulate.\n\nBenefits your brain: The fascinating thing about meditation is its ability to rewire your brain. This concept is called neuroplasticity, where you replace old unhelpful habits with new supportive ones. Meditation has also been shown to improve your ability to process information, stall the effects of aging on your brain, and reduce the sensation of pain.5\n\n**Use Mindfulness Meditation to Ease Anxiety**\n\nA Word From Verywell\n----------------------\n\nMeditation is a practice",

How Is Mantra Meditation Practiced? Benefits of Mantra Meditation Challenges and Insights How to Begin Mantra Meditation Most of us like the idea of meditating, but the concept of actually taking some moments to pause and sit with our thoughts often seems impossible. We get it! Part of the reason that meditating can feel undoable is that it's so easy to start thinking about other things while you meditate-your daily to-do list, your worries and fears, or other thoughts you might ruminate on. If this is you, you might find that it can be helpful to use a mantra while you meditate. A mantra can help quiet your mind and ground you in the present moment. Not sure what a mantra is and how to use one? We've got you covered. Here, we'll go over everything you need to know about mantra meditation, its benefits, and what to do if you run into challenges.\n\n**What Exactly Is a Mantra?**\n\nMany people think of a mantra as something strange and otherworldly-something only super spiritual people understand or use. But a mantra is actually a fairly simple and straightforward concept, says Gayle Weill, LCSW, clinical social worker with expertise in Mindfulness-Based Therapy. There is so much mystery surrounding the word 'mantra,' but it just refers to any word or syllable that you repeat during a meditation session, Weill says.\n\nSome mantras come from specific spiritual traditions (for example, 'om; is a common mantra that's considered a sacred syllable in Hinduism), while others are simply words that are meaningful to you as an individual. When you use a mantra while meditating, it can help focus your mind and lead you into a deeper meditative state, Weill describes.\n\n1. There are many different types of meditation, including mindfulness meditation, meditation connected with yoga, tai chi, and qi gong, and more spiritual types of meditation.\n2. Mantra-based meditation is when you use a mantra while meditating.\n3. Sometimes your mantra is said out loud and sometimes you say it silently to yourself.\n\n**How Is Mantra Meditation Practiced?**\n\nBesides being uncertain about what a mantra is exactly, many people feel unsure how you would go about practicing mantra meditation. Again, it's pretty simple to practice mantra meditation-that's the beauty of it.\n\nChoosing Your Mantra\n\n1. First, you need to come up with your mantra.\n2. Ashley Lorenzo, a yoga teacher at YogaWorks, says that many people come up with a mantra by looking in ancient yogic texts like Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and Yoga Sutras.\n\n**Benefits of Mantra Meditation**\n\nOne of the main benefits of using a mantra while meditating is that it can ground you and bring you back to the present moment. Weill has seen this benefit up close among the clients she works with.\n\n*   A 2022 study found strong evidence that mantra meditation can help reduce high blood pressure.\n*   There is also some convincing evidence that mantra meditation can help with reducing anxiety and boost your immune system, though more research is needed to be sure.\n*   A 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis similarly found that mantra meditation is strongly correlated in reducing high blood pressure, with reductions in both systolic (the top number on your blood pressure readings) and diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number).\n*   They also conclude that there's evidence mantra meditation can help with anxiety and can generally improve mental health and well being.\n*   A small study from 2022 found that mantra-based AMI Meditation may help improve caregiver stress.\n\n**Challenges and Insights**\n\nHere's the thing: if you're experiencing challenges while embarking on a mantra meditation journey, you are far from alone. Meditation is hard for lots of us, and it's totally normal to feel that way.\n\n*   Some challenges of using a mantra for meditation include difficulty focusing, selecting the appropriate mantra, and maintaining the rhythm of recitation.\n*   It's crucial to acknowledge that these difficulties are common and part of the learning journey in mantra meditation.\n\n**How to Begin Mantra Meditation**\n\nOkay, are you ready to get started?\n\n1.  Pick a mantra that resonates with you, whether that be a word, a phrase, an affirmation, or a traditional mantra from Sanskrit texts.\n2.  It's totally normal for your mind to wander when you first start out; when it does, gently bring your focus back to your mantra.\n3.  In terms of duration, start small; even five minutes of mantra meditation is helpful.\n4.  The key is not to overthink it all (we know-easier said than done). Pick a mantra that speaks to you, and then incorporate it into your meditation routine in a way that works for you.\n\nWhether you're just getting started with meditation or have been practicing it for quite some time, embracing the concept of a mantra can be helpful.

Try the 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique**\n\nWhen we're feeling anxious or panicked, our mind races and our thoughts bounce from one worst case scenario to another.\n\nHowever, there are simple exercises that can help us regain control of our thoughts.\n\nThey're known as grounding techniques, because they help us anchor ourselves in the present moment.\n\nThe 5-4-3-2-1 method is one of the most popular grounding techniques.\n\nA mindfulness exercise, this technique helps us come out of anxiety, unpleasant thoughts, or worries and come into what is right here, right now in the present, through our senses, says Stephanie Strauss, a yoga, meditation, and mindfulness expert.\n\n**Understanding Grounding Techniques**\n\nGrounding techniques are mental and emotional exercises that help us reconnect with the present moment and reduce feelings of anxiety, stress, or dissociation.\n\nWhen our thoughts start to get away from us, using a grounding technique can help us pull our focus away from those thoughts and back to what's happening right now, in our body and in our environment.\n\nThis can help interrupt our stress response and bring a sense of calm.\n\nThere are several types of grounding techniques, including:\n\n*   Sensory grounding: These techniques involve using our senses to anchor ourselves in the present moment.\n*   Physical grounding: These techniques involve physical movements or actions that bring our attention back to our body and the present moment.\n*   Cognitive grounding: These techniques involve engaging our mind in mental activities that shift our focus away from distressing thoughts or emotions.\n*   Environmental grounding: These techniques involve creating a safe and soothing environment to help regulate our emotions and reduce our anxiety.\n\n**How to Do the 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique**\n\nIf you want to try the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique, here's how to do it:\n\n*   Identify 5 things you can see right now.\n*   Identify 4 things you can feel.\n*   Identify 3 things you can hear.\n*   Identify 2 things you can smell.\n*   Identify 1 thing you can taste.\n\nThis exercise uses your senses to anchor you in the present moment, helping you find some calm amidst the chaos.\n\n**Tips for Practicing the 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique**\n\nThese are some tips that can help you practice the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique successfully:\n\n*   Recognize when you need it.\n*   Do it thoroughly.\n*   Avoid judgment.\n*   Check in with yourself.\n*   Repeat the exercise as needed.\n*   Experiment with different variations.\n*   Be kind to yourself.\n\n**Benefits of the 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique**\n\nThese are some of the benefits of practicing the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique:\n\n*   Reduces anxiety.\n*   Improves mindfulness.\n*   Regulates emotions.\n*   Relieves stress and anxiety.\n*   Counters negative thoughts.\n*   Improves concentration.\n\n**When to Use the 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique**\n\nYou can use the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique whenever you feel overwhelmed by anxiety, stress, or strong emotions.\n\nHere are some situations where it may be particularly helpful:\n\n*   During anxiety episodes.\n*   Before an important event.\n*   When feeling overwhelmed.\n*   During emotional upsets.\n*   While dealing with delays.\n*   Before bedtime.  <hr> **References**\n\n1.

One of my favorite types of guided meditation is chakra meditation.\n\nChakra meditation is an ancient wellness practice that is designed to unlock the energy centers (chakras) in our bodies.1 Chakra meditation helps us feel more grounded, centered, connected, and peaceful, says Karla Helbert, an internationally certified yoga therapist (C-IAYT) and author of The Chakras in Grief and Trauma.\n\nIf you're curious about chakra meditation and how to get started with it, here's everything you need to know.\n\n**At a Glance**\n\nWhether you're a seasoned yogi or a newbie, chakra meditation is worth a try. Chakras are invisible energy centers in our bodies, positioned from the base of the spine to the top of the head. There are seven in total and each one corresponds to different colors and functions.\n\nChakra meditation helps us explore each of our seven chakras. The process can help you feel more positive, relaxed, and grounded. It can be a great way to level up your self-care routine!\n\n**Introduction to Chakra Meditation**\n\nChakra meditation is an Eastern spiritual practice that dates back thousands of years. The earliest references to it are found in ancient Indian yogic texts dating back to around 1500-1200 BCE.1 It was later adopted by other spiritual systems, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.\n\nChakra is a Sanskrit word that means circle, disc, or wheel, says Helbert. There are seven chakras in total, positioned from the base of the spine to the top of the head.2 Although the chakras aren't scientifically recognized, in the context of this belief system, they are invisible energy centers within the body that vibrate and spin with energy.\n\nEach chakra influences the glands in its vicinity.2 Therefore, each chakra corresponds to different qualities and functions, Helbert explains. Imbalances or blockages in any of the chakras are linked to physical or mental health problems. Chakra meditation helps us realign the chakras and bring our body back into balance.\n\nWhen the chakras are aligned and activated, they vibrate at a higher frequency, giving us energy and vitality. The chakras regulate and generate functions that impact us physically, energetically, emotionally, mentally, sensorially, intuitively, and spiritually.\n\n*   - KARLA HELBERT, YOGA THERAPIST\n\n**The Seven Chakras**\n\nBefore we go further, let's take a quick tour of the seven chakras.\n\n1.  **Root Chakra**\n    *   Name: Muladhara\n    *   Location: Base of the spine\n    *   Color: Red\n    *   Associations: Health, safety, security, and stability\n    *   Imbalances: Fear, insecurity, anxiety, financial stress, and substance use\n\n2.  **Sacral Chakra**\n    *   Name: Svadhisthana\n    *   Location: Lower abdomen (a little below your belly button)\n    *   Color: Orange\n    *   Associations: Creativity, passion, pleasure, and emotional well-being\n    *   Imbalances: Creative blocks, emotional instability, dependency issues, and intimacy issues\n\n3.  **Solar Plexus Chakra**\n    *   Name: Manipura\n    *   Location: Upper abdomen (above your belly button)\n    *   Color: Yellow\n    *   Associations: Confidence, willpower, gut instincts, and inner strength\n    *   Imbalances: Low self-esteem, difficulty concentrating, control issues, stress, and digestive difficulties\n\n4.  **Heart Chakra**\n    *   Name: Anahata\n    *   Location: Center of the chest (near your heart)\n    *   Color: Pink or green\n    *   Associations: Love, compassion, forgiveness, and emotional balance\n    *   Imbalances: Lack of empathy, relationship difficulties, and heart problems\n\n5.  **Throat Chakra**\n    *   Name: Vishuddha\n    *   Location: Throat area\n    *   Color: Blue\n    *   Associations: Communication, truth, honesty, clarity, and inspiration\n    *   Imbalances: Fear of speaking, difficulty expressing oneself, nervousness, sore throat, clogged sinuses, and tooth, gum, or jaw pain\n\n6.  **Third Eye Chakra**\n    *   Name: Ajna\n    *   Location: Center of your forehead (between your brows)\n    *   Color: Indigo\n    *   Associations: Intuition, insight, imagination, and spiritual awareness\n    *   Imbalances: Lack of clarity, difficulty making decisions, eye problems, headaches, migraines, and sleep issues\n\n7.  **Crown Chakra**\n    *   Name: Sahasrara\n    *   Location: Top of the head\n    *   Color: Violet or white\n    *   Associations: Spirituality, divine connection, and enlightenment\n    *   Imbalances: Depression, loss of faith, and",

    "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/i-tried-junk-journaling-for-a-month-11679873",
    "content": "& Questions 1 2 3 4 References: 1 Lisa Anderson LCSW is the clinical director at Brooks Healing Center, Tennessee. 2 Allison Barton, a San Diego-based therapist specializing in trauma, anxiety, and perfectionism. 3 Janet Bayramyan LCSW. Note: Some sources may not be directly quoted but are acknowledged in this piece. **My Weekly Junk Journaling Experience** To stay as close to the theme as possible, I decided to create my own notebook for this experiment by repurposing discarded scraps. You can see a couple of pages from my journal at the top of this article. I used an old wedding card to make the notebook cover and cut and stapled old newspaper sheets, paper bags, and leftover wrapping paper to make the pages.\n\n**Why Junk Journaling Works**\n\nIt May Lower Stress And Anxiety There is something incredibly freeing about not worrying if your handwriting is neat or your thoughts make sense. Instead of writing in structured sentences, you can use colors, textures, and images to express your feelings. This creative self-expression has been shown to help reduce stress, ease anxiety, and improve overall mood.\n\n**Should You Try Junk Journaling?**\n\nSince junk journaling focuses on creative self-expression rather than skill, it's suitable for people of all ages and artistic abilities, says Barton. It's particularly helpful for those who struggle with perfectionism as it promotes free and non-judgmental creative exploration, she adds. \n\n**Alternatives to Junk Journaling**\n\nIf junk journaling is not quite your thing, no worries! Several alternative activities offer comparable mental health benefits. For example: \n1. Coloring\n2. Bullet Journaling\n3. Collage Making\n4. Clay Modeling\n5. Diamond Art\n6. Gardening\n7. Knitting\n8. Crocheting\n9. Zentangling\n\nThe key is to choose a creative outlet that feels natural and enjoyable to you-one that gives your brain a break while also helping you express yourself, says Anderson.\n\n**Takeaway**\n\nWill I keep junk journaling after this month-long experiment? Absolutely. It may have started as a curious dip into a TikTok trend, but I can see junk journaling as a fun addition to my self-care toolkit-one that has helped me slow down, be more present, and more grateful for life's little moments.\n\nAm I suggesting everyone should start junk journaling, though? Not necessarily. Self-care is like Cinderella's shoe, one size doesn't fit all. Like the experts said, choose what resonates with you the most.",

MRI scans have found that regular meditation is linked to increased thickness of the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with higher-order brain functions such as awareness, concentration, memory, and decision-making.\n\n4\\. Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and rewire itself based on new information and experiences.\n\n5\\. Meditation increases neuroplasticity by improving neural connectivity patterns across different regions of the brain.\n\n6\\. Apart from regulating functions like sleep, growth, and metabolism, these chemicals play an important role in maintaining our emotional equilibrium, by making us feel positive and happy.\n\n7\\. Meditation not only calms our blood pressure, respiratory rate, and heart rate, it also alters our brain waves.\n\n8\\. Research shows that meditating regularly reduces the size of the amygdala, which is responsible for the fight-or-flight response, significantly reducing stress levels. \n\n11\\.
