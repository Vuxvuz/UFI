Symptoms begin in childhood and usually continue into the teen years and adulthood. ADHD often co-occurs with other disorders and conditions, such as conduct problems, learning disorders, sleep problems, anxiety, or depression, which can make the conditions harder to diagnose and treat.\n\nFor many people with ADHD, symptoms cause problems in daily life. Symptoms can make it hard to get things done; interfere with school, work, or other activities; and strain social relationships. Children with ADHD are at increased risk for injuries, social problems, family stress, and poor grades. Teens and adults with ADHD are more likely to engage in risky behaviors, such as substance use and unsafe sexual activity.\n\nNIMH supports research into the possible causes of ADHD. Researchers are investigating factors such as genes, hormones and other molecules, brain structure and activity, and prenatal and early life exposures. NIMH-supported research is also exploring the behavioral profiles of children and adults with ADHD to better diagnose and treat the disorder. This includes identifying symptoms associated with particular types of ADHD and their presentation at different ages.\n\nWe’re also supporting research on treatments, services, and interventions for people with ADHD and their families. Standard ADHD treatments include medication and psychosocial interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, parent training, and school interventions. Newer treatments include neurofeedback, cognitive training, mindfulness, and neuromodulation.

Some HIV medications may cause symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleeplessness and may make some mental health issues worse.\n\nHaving a mental disorder may make HIV prevention and treatment more challenging for some people. Identifying effective ways to support the mental health of people with HIV can help improve HIV treatment and overall patient well-being.\n\nNIMH funds and conducts research to help reduce HIV transmission globally and improve the quality of life for people with HIV. We’re supporting studies to understand how HIV affects the brain and how to support people’s mental health to improve HIV prevention and treatment. Researchers are also looking at ways to increase access to mental health treatments in real-world settings.\n\nAdditionally, NIMH supports behavioral research aimed at preventing HIV and improving the health and well-being of people with HIV. We also fund research on structural and social factors to improve treatment and access to care.\n\nNIMH is one of several NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices that support data-driven research aimed at understanding, treating, and ultimately curing HIV. This includes work to develop new data tools and techniques that may make it easier for people to access HIV testing services, receive comprehensive HIV treatment and care, and stick with their medication plans.\n\nClinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions.

Explore clinical trials about schizophrenia Share outreach materials about schizophrenia Find help and support Additional federal resources\n\nSchizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may seem as though they have lost touch with reality, which can be distressing for them and for their family and friends. People are usually first diagnosed with schizophrenia between the ages of 16 and 30, after the first episode of psychosis.\n\nBrochures and fact sheets with more information about schizophrenia, including signs, symptoms, and treatment options. Available for free in print and online.\n\nNIMH news about schizophrenia, including press releases and highlights on the latest research findings.\n\nInformation about the prevalence and treatment of schizophrenia in the United States.\n\nSchizophrenia symptoms can make it difficult to participate in everyday activities and many people with schizophrenia face significant health, social, and economic challenges. People with schizophrenia often experience a delay between the onset of symptoms and the start of treatment, which can impact their response to treatment and lead to worse health and well-being over the long term.\n\nResearch shows that gradual changes in thinking, mood, and social functioning often appear before the first episode of psychosis. Identifying these subtle changes and connecting people with treatment before their first episode could have long-term benefits for their health, well-being, and daily functioning. Treatment can help people with schizophrenia engage in school or work, achieve independence, and enjoy personal relationships.\n\nNIMH supports research to understand the origins of schizophrenia and clarify how symptoms develop over time. Researchers are studying ways to identify people who are likely to develop schizophrenia before psychosis and other symptoms emerge. They’re also trying to find better ways to evaluate a person’s symptoms and functioning and predict how they will change over time.\n\nWe’re funding research that builds on these findings to develop more effective approaches to prevention and treatment. NIMH-supported research explores new treatment approaches that target the disorder's specific cognitive, emotional, or interpersonal aspects. Researchers are working to improve and expand coordinated specialty care, a recovery-oriented approach to treating early psychosis that emphasizes shared decision-making among specialists, the person experiencing psychosis, and family members. They’re also looking at ways to implement evidence-based treatment and services in community settings.\n\nNIMH supports the Accelerating Medicines Partnership® Program for Schizophrenia, a public-private partnership that aims to identify new and better treatment targets for schizophrenia and related mental health conditions.

    "content": "Information about suicide prevention is also available in English.\n\nPara ayuda, llame o envíe un mensaje de texto al 988, la Línea de Prevención del Suicidio y Crisis . La línea de ayuda ofrece apoyo emocional, de forma gratuita y confidencial, a personas en crisis de suicidio o angustia emocional. Esta línea está abierta 24 horas al día, 7 días a la semana en todos los Estados Unidos y está disponible en español o en inglés. También puede obtener apoyo a través de su chat en vivo . Si le preocupa lo que está publicando un amigo en las redes, comuníquese directamente con las redes sociales o llame al 911 en caso de emergencia. Ellos tienen procesos para comunicarse con la persona y ponerla en contacto con la ayuda que necesita.\n\nEl suicidio es una de las principales preocupaciones de la salud pública. En términos generales, en 2021, el suicidio fue la causa número once de muerte (en inglés) en los Estados Unidos y cobró la vida de más de 48,100 personas. Si bien el suicidio es complicado y trágico, a menudo se puede prevenir. Saber las señales de advertencia del suicidio y la manera de obtener ayuda puede salvar vidas.\n\nEl suicidio ocurre cuando las personas se hacen daño a sí mismas con la intención de terminar con su vida y, como resultado, fallecen.\n\nUn intento de suicidio es cuando las personas se lastiman con la intención de terminar con su vida, pero no mueren.\n\nEvite el uso de términos como “cometer suicidio”, “suicidio exitoso” o “suicidio fallido” cuando se refiera al suicidio y los intentos de suicidio, ya que a menudo estos términos tienen connotaciones negativas.\n\nLos signos de advertencia de que alguien puede estar en riesgo inmediato de intentar suicidarse incluyen:\n\nHablar de querer morir o desear matarse. Hablar de sentirse vacío o desesperado, o de no tener motivos para vivir. Hablar de sentirse atrapado o pensar que no hay ninguna solución. Sentir un dolor físico o emocional insoportable. Hablar de ser una carga para los demás. Alejarse y amigos. Regalar posesiones importantes. Decir adiós a amigos y familiares. Poner sus asuntos en orden, como hacer un testamento. Asumir grandes riesgos que podrían resultar en la muerte, como conducir extremadamente rápido. Hablar o pensar en la muerte con frecuencia.\n\nOtros signos de advertencia graves de que alguien puede estar en riesgo de intentar suicidarse incluyen:\n\nMostrar cambios extremos en el estado de ánimo, pasando repentinamente de estar muy triste a sentirse muy tranquilo o feliz. Hacer planes o buscar formas de suicidarse, como buscar métodos letales en línea, acumular pastillas o comprar un arma. Hablar de sentirse muy culpable o avergonzado. Consumir alcohol o drogas con más frecuencia. Mostrarse ansioso o agitado. Cambiar los hábitos alimenticios o de sueño. Mostrar furia o hablar de buscar venganza.\n\nEl suicidio no es una respuesta usual al estrés. Los pensamientos o las acciones suicidas son un signo de angustia extrema y no se deben ignorar. Si usted o alguien que conoce presenta estos signos de advertencia, busque ayuda lo antes posible, especialmente si el comportamiento es nuevo o ha aumentado recientemente.\n\nLos siguientes son 5 pasos que usted puede tomar para ayudar a una persona que tiene pensamientos suicidas.\n\nLas personas de todos los géneros, edades y etnicidades pueden estar en riesgo. El comportamiento suicida es complejo y no hay solo una causa que lo origina. Los principales factores de riesgo son:\n\ndepresión u otros trastornos mentales o de consumo de sustancias; dolor crónico; historial personal de intentos de suicidio anteriores; antecedentes familiares de trastornos mentales o de consumo de sustancias; antecedentes familiares de suicidio; exposición a violencia familiar, incluido el maltrato físico o abuso sexual; presencia de pistolas u otras armas de fuego en el hogar; libertad reciente de un reclusorio o una cárcel; exposición, ya sea directa o indirectamente, a comportamientos suicidas de otros, como de sus familiares o compañeros, o de alguna celebridad.\n\nPara personas con pensamientos suicidas, la exposición, ya sea directa o indirecta, a comportamientos suicidas de otros, como sus familiares o compañeros, o de alguna celebridad, también puede aumentar el riesgo.\n\nLa mayoría de las personas que tienen factores de riesgo de suicidio no intentarán suicidarse, pero es difícil saber quién actuará sobre sus pensamientos suicidas. Aunque es importante tener en cuenta los factores de riesgo de suicidio, una persona que activamente muestra signos de advertencia de querer quitarse la vida puede tener un mayor riesgo de correr peligro y necesitar atención inmediata.\n\nLos eventos estresantes de la vida (como la pérdida de un ser querido, problemas legales o dificultades financieras) y los factores estresantes interpersonales (como vergüenza, acoso, intimidación, discriminación o problemas en las relaciones) pueden contribuir a la posibilidad de suicidarse, especialmente si ocurren conjuntamente con factores de riesgo de suicidio.\n\nA menudo, los familiares y amigos son los primeros en reconocer los signos de advertencia sobre el suicidio y ellos pueden dar el primer paso para ayudar a un ser querido encontrar tratamiento de salud mental. Si no sabe dónde empezar, consulte los recursos en la página del Instituto Nacional de la Salud Mental (NIMH, por sus siglas en inglés) sobre ayuda para la salud mental.\n\nDetección universal: Diversas investigaciones han mostrado que una herramienta de detección que consiste en tres preguntas ayuda al personal de las salas de emergencia a identificar a adultos en riesgo de suicidio. Se descubrió que la evaluación de todos los pacientes, independientemente del motivo por el que llegaron a la sala de emergencias, duplicó el número de pacientes que se pudieron identificar como en riesgo de suicidio. Los investigadores calcularon que las herramientas de detección del riesgo de suicidio han logrado identificar a más de tres millones de adultos adicionales que corren peligro de suicidarse cada año. Predicción del riesgo de suicidio con el uso de registros electrónicos de salud: Los investigadores del NIMH se asociaron con el Departamento de Asuntos de los Veteranos (VA, por sus siglas en inglés) y otras entidades para desarrollar programas de cómputo que podrían ayudar a identificar un mayor riesgo de suicidio entre los veteranos de las fuerzas armadas que reciben servicios de atención de salud en el VA. Otros sistemas de atención de la salud están empezando a utilizar datos provenientes de registros electrónicos de salud para también identificar a personas en riesgo de suicidio.\n\nExisten intervenciones eficaces basadas en evidencia para ayudar a las personas que están en riesgo de suicidio.\n\nPlanificación de seguridad: Se ha demostrado que una planificación personalizada de seguridad ayuda a reducir los pensamientos y las acciones suicidas. Los pacientes trabajan con un proveedor de cuidados de la salud para elaborar un plan que describe formas de limitar acceso a medios letales como armas de fuego, pastillas o venenos. El plan también enumera varias estrategias de afrontamiento, así como personas o recursos que pueden ayudar en una crisis. Llamadas de seguimiento: Hay investigaciones que han demostrado que cuando los pacientes en riesgo reciben llamadas telefónicas de apoyo que incluyen un monitoreo del riesgo y se les anima a participar en tratamientos y comportamientos seguros, así como a buscar ayuda, su riesgo de suicidio disminuye.\n\nSe ha descubierto que los tipos de intervenciones psicosociales, descritos a continuación, ayudan a las personas que han intentado suicidarse y pueden evitar que hagan otro intento de suicidarse.\n\nLa terapia cognitivo conductual puede ayudar a las personas a aprender nuevas formas de sobrellevar experiencias estresantes. Este tipo de terapia ayuda a las personas a reconocer sus patrones de pensamiento y a contemplar acciones alternativas cuando surgen pensamientos sobre el suicidio. La terapia dialéctica conductual ha demostrado que reduce conductas suicidas en los adolescentes. También ha quedado comprobado que este tipo de terapia reduce la tasa de intentos de suicidio en adultos con trastorno límite de la personalidad, una enfermedad mental caracterizada por un patrón continuo de estados de ánimo, autoimagen y conductas inestables que a menudo dan origen a acciones impulsivas y a problemas en las relaciones. Un terapeuta capacitado en este tipo de terapia puede ayudar a la persona a reconocer cuando sus sentimientos o acciones son perturbadores o poco saludables, y le enseña destrezas que pueden ayudarles a sobrellevar de mejor manera las situaciones desagradables..\n\nLos medicamentos pueden beneficiar a algunas personas en riesgo de suicidio. Las personas pueden colaborar con sus proveedores de atención médica mejor medicamento, o una combinación de estos, así como la dosis adecuada. A menudo, muchas personas en riesgo de suicidio tienen alguna enfermedad mental o problema de abuso de sustancias, y pueden beneficiarse de tomar medicamentos al mismo tiempo que reciben una intervención psicosocial.\n\nLa clozapina es un medicamento antipsicótico que se usa primordialmente para tratar a persona con esquizofrenia. A la fecha, es el único medicamento con una indicación específica de la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de los Estados Unidos (FDA, por sus siglas en inglés) para reducir el riesgo de comportamientos suicidas recurrentes en pacientes con esquizofrenia o un trastorno esquizoafectivo (en inglés).\n\nSi le han recetado un medicamento, es importante que:\n\nHable con un proveedor de atención médica para cerciorarse de que comprende los riesgos y los beneficios del medicamento que está tomando. No deje de tomar un medicamento sin antes hablar con su médico u otro proveedor de atención médica. Dejar de tomar repentinamente un medicamente puede hacer que los síntomas empeoren. También es posible que surjan otros efectos de abstinencia molestos o posiblemente peligrosos. Informe a un proveedor de atención médica de inmediato sobre cualquier preocupación por los efectos secundarios. Este profesional puede ayudar a determinar si necesita cambiar la dosis o tomar un medicamento diferente. Notifique cualquier efecto secundario grave a MedWatch, el programa de la FDA para reportar eventos adversos , ya sea en línea o llamando al 1-800-332-1088. Usted o su proveedor de atención médica puede enviar un informe.\n\nPara consultar la información más actualizada sobre cualquier medicamento, sus efectos secundarios y advertencias, visite el sitio web de la FDA .\n\nLa atención colaborativa es un enfoque en función de equipos para la atención de la salud mental. Un administrador de atención de la salud conductual trabajará en coordinación con la persona, su proveedor de atención primaria y los especialistas en salud mental para establecer un plan de tratamiento. Se ha demostrado que la atención colaborativa es una forma eficaz de tratar la depresión y reducir los pensamientos suicidas.\n\nSi no sabe dónde conseguir ayuda, su médico u otro proveedor de atención médica puede referirle a un profesional de salud mental con licencia, como un psiquiatra o un psicólogo. Encuentre consejos para ayudarlo a prepararse y aprovechar al máximo su cita e información sobre cómo obtener ayuda.\n\nLa Administración de Servicios de Abuso de Sustancias y Salud Mental (SAMHSA, por sus siglas en inglés) tiene un localizador de tratamientos en línea para ayudarlo a encontrar servicios de salud mental en su área.\n\nEl NIMH apoya investigaciones prometedoras que probablemente generen un impacto en la reducción del suicidio en los Estados Unidos. Las investigaciones están ayudando a mejorar nuestra capacidad para identificar a las personas en riesgo de suicidio y para desarrollar tratamientos eficaces o mejorarlos. Los investigadores del NIMH continúan estudiando el suicidio y cómo implementar mejor los programas de prevención e intervención del suicidio en diferentes contextos, entre ellos, dentro de la atención médica, las comunidades, las escuelas y en entornos del sistema judicial.\n\nObtenga más información en inglés sobre las prioridades de investigación del NIMH y sus investigaciones recientes sobre la prevención del suicidio.\n\nPreguntas frecuentes sobre el suicidio: Este folleto ofrece información sobre el suicidio, incluyendo factores de riesgo, síntomas y signos de advertencia, terapias y otras opciones de tratamiento, dónde encontrar ayuda para usted o para otros, e investigaciones sobre el suicidio y la prevención del suicidio. Señales de advertencia sobre el suicidio: Esta infografía del NIMH presenta conductas y sentimientos que podrían ser señales de que alguien está pensando en suicidarse. 5 medidas que puede tomar para ayudar a una persona con dolor emocional: Esta infografía del NIMH presenta cinco medidas para ayudar a una persona con dolor emocional, a fin de prevenir el suicidio. Recursos para compartir sobre la prevención del suicidio: Puede usar estos recursos digitales del NIMH, que incluyen gráficos y mensajes, para difundir la importancia de la prevención del suicidio y apoyar la concientización y la educación de este problema en su comunidad.\n\nEl Departamento de Salud y Servicios Humanos de los Estados Unidos publicó la Estrategia Nacional para la Prevención del Suicidio 2024 (en inglés), un enfoque integral de 10 años para la prevención del suicidio que brinda recomendaciones para abordar las brechas en este campo. La estrategia va acompañada de un plan de acción federal, que identifica más de 200 medidas que diferentes áreas del gobierno federal tomarán durante los próximos 3 años para apoyar esos objetivos. El informe al Congreso sobre el suicidio de jóvenes afroamericanos (en inglés) es una respuesta del Departamento de Salud y Servicios Humanos al informe sobre la crisis de suicidios de afroamericanos en Estados Unidos , elaborado por el Grupo de Congresistas Negros de 2019, (Ring the Alarm: The Crisis of Black Suicide in America). Este informe examina los patrones de suicidio juvenil por raza y etnia, lo que se sabe sobre las características de los jóvenes fallecidos por suicidio, información sobre factores de riesgo y protección, intervenciones y brechas de conocimiento que aún quedan. Centro de Recursos para la Prevención del Suicidio (SPRC, por sus siglas en inglés) . Este es el único centro de recursos con apoyo federal dedicado a promover la implementación de la Estrategia Nacional para la Prevención del Suicidio y es financiado por la Administración de Servicios de Abuso de Sustancias y Salud Mental (SAMHSA, por sus siglas en inglés). El sitio web está en inglés, pero tienen algunos recursos en español. El Plan Estratégico Nacional de Prevención del Suicidio para Indígenas Americanos y Nativos de Alaska es una iniciativa nacional que aborda la prevención del suicidio, basada en el fomento de las colaboraciones entre tribus, organizaciones tribales, organizaciones indígenas urbanas y el Servicio de Salud Indígena (IHS, por sus siglas en inglés). El sitio web en inglés del Servicio de Salud Indígena para la prevención y la atención del suicidio ofrece recursos para respaldar los esfuerzos de prevención del suicidio y para ayudar a las comunidades y las personas a comprender y obtener servicios relacionados con el suicidio. La página web en inglés sobre Prevención del Suicidio de los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC, por sus siglas en inglés) ofrece recursos para que las comunidades y los estados apoyen los esfuerzos de prevención del suicidio. MedlinePlus contiene información sobre el suicidio proveniente de la Biblioteca Nacional de Medicina de los Estados Unidos (NLM, por sus siglas en inglés). #BeThe1To . Este es el mensaje de la Red Nacional de Prevención del Suicidio para correr la voz sobre las acciones que todos pueden tomar para prevenir el suicidio.

People with PTSD often have co-occurring conditions, such as depression, substance use, or anxiety disorders.\n\nAspects of the traumatic event and certain biological and social factors may make some people more likely to develop PTSD. For instance, previous exposure to adversity and other traumatic experiences, especially in childhood, can increase a person’s chance of developing PTSD later in life. While many people who live through a dangerous event experience some symptoms initially, most do not develop PTSD—multiple factors play a part.\n\nNIMH is supporting research to understand the factors that influence a person’s mental health after a potentially traumatic event. Researchers are working to understand what causes specific PTSD symptoms and why symptoms differ in type and severity from person to person.

    "content": "Brain stimulation therapies can play an important role in treating mental disorders. These therapies work by activating or inhibiting the brain with electricity. The electricity can be given directly through electrodes implanted in the brain or indirectly through electrodes placed on the scalp. The electricity can also be induced by applying magnetic fields to the head.\n\nThis video from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) provides an overview of brain stimulation therapies and how they can be used to treat mental disorders.\n\nThis page provides basic information about brain stimulation therapies. It does not cover all forms of therapy or all mental disorders for which a therapy might be used. The information should not be used as a guide for making medical decisions. Research is ongoing to determine the best use of these therapies and if they are effective treatments for other disorders and conditions.\n\nThe page is divided into therapies that are authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat specific mental disorders, including depression, bipolar disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), versus therapies that are newer and still considered experimental.\n\nElectroconvulsive therapy Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation Vagus nerve stimulation\n\nThe experimental therapies covered on this page are:\n\nOther brain stimulation therapies not discussed here may also hold promise for treating mental disorders. Information about these therapies is updated frequently. See the FDA website for the latest information, warnings, and guidance on brain stimulation devices and announcements about new ones.\n\nIn most cases, brain stimulation therapy is used only after other treatments have been tried. Although less frequently used than psychotherapy or medication, brain stimulation therapies hold promise for people with certain mental disorders who have not responded to other treatments.\n\nBrain stimulation therapies should be prescribed and monitored by a health care provider with specific training and expertise. A trained medical team performs the procedures. Most involve using anesthesia to sedate the patient and a muscle relaxant to prevent them from moving. If so, an anesthesiologist will monitor breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure throughout the procedure.\n\nA treatment plan involving brain stimulation therapy is based on a person's individual needs and medical situation. It usually also includes psychotherapy, medication, or both. Patients will likely be advised to continue these other treatments during and after therapy. Patients should not stop a treatment unless specifically advised by a health care provider.\n\nBrain stimulation therapies treat serious mental illnesses. They are often used when a person is experiencing dangerous circumstances, such as not responding to the outside world or is at risk of harming themselves.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or having thoughts of suicide, call or text the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org . In life-threatening situations, call 911.\n\nThe FDA determines whether foods, drugs, medical devices, and other products are safe to use. The FDA commonly gives two types of authorization to devices like brain stimulation therapies.\n\nApproved means that the FDA has decided that the benefits of the device outweigh the known risks, as demonstrated by the results of clinical testing. Approval is usually required for devices that might have a significant risk of injury or illness, including devices implanted in the body. Cleared means that the device is substantially equivalent to a similar device that the FDA has already cleared or approved. Clearance is usually given to lower-risk devices used outside the body.\n\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a noninvasive procedure that treats serious mental disorders by using an electric current to induce seizure activity in the brain. It has the longest history of use for depression and is one of the most widely used brain stimulation therapies.\n\nThe FDA has cleared ECT to treat severe depressive episodes in people 13 years and older with depression or bipolar disorder. In some cases, ECT has also been used to treat schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and mania.\n\nECT is usually considered only if a person’s illness has not improved after trying other treatments like psychotherapy or medication. To be eligible for ECT, a person must meet one of two criteria.\n\nThey have severe, treatment-resistant depression. They require a rapid response due to life-threatening circumstances. For instance, they are catatonic (unable to move or respond to the outside world), suicidal, or malnourished.\n\nECT can be effective when medications have not worked, cannot be tolerated, or are undesirable due to physical illness, which is often the case in older adults. ECT also begins working more rapidly than antidepressant medications, usually taking effect within the first week of treatment.\n\nBefore a doctor performs ECT, the patient is sedated with a short-acting general anesthetic and given an intravenous muscle relaxant to prevent movement.\n\nElectrodes are placed at precise locations on the patient’s head. An electric current is sent through the electrodes into the brain, causing seizure activity that lasts under a minute. Anesthesia ensures the patient does not experience pain or feel the electrical pulses. Often, a blood pressure cuff is used on an arm or leg to block the muscle relaxant and allow movement of that limb to confirm the seizure activity is adequate. The patient wakes up 5–10 minutes after the procedure ends. They may feel groggy at first as the anesthesia wears off, but after about an hour, they are usually alert and can resume normal activities.\n\nA typical course of ECT is administered three times a week until a patient's symptoms improve (usually within 6–12 treatments). Frequently, a patient who undergoes ECT also takes antidepressant or mood-stabilizing medication.\n\nAlthough ECT is effective in treating depressive episodes, follow-up treatment—antidepressant medication, maintenance ECT , or both—is usually required to sustain the clinical improvement and reduce the chances that symptoms return. Maintenance ECT varies depending on the patient’s needs and may range from one session per week to one session every few months.\n\nThe most common side effects associated with ECT include:\n\nHeadaches Upset stomach Muscle aches Memory loss Disorientation or confusion\n\nSome patients may experience memory loss, especially of memories around the time of treatment. Sometimes the memory problems are more severe, but usually they improve over the days and weeks following the end of an ECT course.\n\nThe risk of memory loss is affected by how the ECT procedure is performed. Two important aspects of ECT are electrode placement and pulse width.\n\nThe placement of electrodes on the head determines where in the brain the electric field is induced. Research has found that memory problems are more common with the older form of ECT (bilateral ECT), in which electrodes are placed on both sides of the head. In comparison, unilateral ECT has a lower risk of memory loss. Unilateral ECT involves placing an electrode on only one side of the head, typically the right side because it is opposite the brain's learning and memory areas, and the other electrode on top of the head.\n\nPulse width describes how long, in milliseconds, each electric pulse lasts. Modern ECT devices can deliver electrical signals using brief or ultra-brief pulses. These short pulses are as effective as the traditional form of ECT but given at a lower dose, helping further reduce cognitive side effects like memory loss.\n\nIt is important to talk to a doctor about these key aspects of ECT (electrode placement and pulse width) before starting treatment.\n\nRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive therapy that uses an electromagnet to stimulate the brain using repeated low-intensity pulses. The magnetic field it creates is about the same strength as an MRI scanner. The magnetic field is turned on and off very rapidly, inducing weak electrical currents that stimulate neurons and neural circuits in the brain.\n\nrTMS is FDA-cleared for treatment-resistant depression, OCD, migraines, anxiety with depression, and smoking dependence. However, it does not match the therapeutic effects of ECT, and it is not approved for youth under 15 years old.\n\nThe FDA cleared the first rTMS device in 2008 for depression in people who did not respond to at least one antidepressant medication in the current depressive episode. Although ECT is still considered the \"gold standard\" for treatment-resistant depression, strong clinical evidence supports the effectiveness of rTMS in reducing depressive symptoms. rTMS is now used to treat moderate-to-severe depression in cases where medications have proven ineffective or intolerable.\n\nSince 2008, rTMS has been cleared to treat several types of depression, including depression with comorbid anxiety and depression with suicidality. In 2018, the FDA cleared rTMS for severe OCD . In 2020, the FDA granted breakthrough device designation to rTMS for bipolar depression, given to medical devices with preliminary evidence of clinical effectiveness compared to available treatments.\n\nMore recently, the FDA cleared a rapid-acting form of rTMS for treatment-resistant depression . Accelerated protocols that act more quickly than standard rTMS show similar effectiveness while shortening treatment length. Thus, patients benefit from receiving an entire course of treatment in much less time and getting relief from their symptoms more rapidly. In March 2024, the FDA also cleared rTMS for the adjunctive treatment of depression in adolescents 15 years and older.\n\nNewer forms of rTMS involving magnetic pulses with other parameters are also being investigated to treat depression, OCD, and other mental disorders.\n\nRather than applying electricity directly to the head as with ECT, rTMS uses low-intensity magnetic pulses to stimulate the brain. Unlike ECT, in which stimulation is generalized, in rTMS, magnetic stimulation is targeted to a specific brain site. Also in contrast to ECT, the procedure does not require anesthesia and can be performed in a clinical or office setting.\n\nA typical rTMS session usually lasts anywhere from 3–40 minutes. A typical course of rTMS treatment consists of daily sessions 5 days per week for 4–6 weeks.\n\nAccelerated rTMS protocols work much faster (often within a week). In this case, multiple sessions are delivered on a single day, with short breaks in between.\n\nAn electromagnetic coil is held against the head near an area of the brain thought to be involved in mood regulation, cognitive control, or both. These brain areas include the left prefrontal cortex (for depression) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex or anterior cingulate cortex (for OCD). In deep TMS, two coils may be used to deliver more stimulation to the region and target larger structures deep in the brain. Short electromagnetic pulses are repeatedly administered through the coil or coils. The patient usually feels a slight knocking or tapping on the head as the pulses are administered. The electromagnetic pulses pass easily through the skull and cause small electric currents that stimulate nerve cells in the targeted brain region.\n\nThere is not consensus on the best way to position the coil on the head or deliver the electromagnetic pulses. It has also yet to be determined if rTMS works best when delivered as a single treatment or when combined with psychotherapy, medication, or both. Research is underway to establish the safest and most effective uses of rTMS, the optimal brain sites to target, and the best follow-up approach to sustain clinical improvement.\n\nOverall, rTMS is safe and well tolerated But, like all therapies described here, it can have side effects. These include:\n\nDiscomfort at the site on the head where the magnet is placed Contraction or tingling of scalp, jaw, or face muscles during the procedure Mild headaches or brief lightheadedness Dizziness\n\nUsing magnetic pulses and targeting a specific brain site results in milder stimulation than in ECT, avoiding most seizure activity. Although it is possible for the procedure to cause seizures, a comprehensive review found that the risk is low. Most side effects appear to be mild and short-term when expert guidelines are followed.\n\nLong-term side effects have not been determined, and more research is needed to establish the long-term safety of rTMS.\n\nVagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a surgical procedure that involves a device implanted under the skin. The device sends electrical pulses through the left vagus nerve that runs from the brainstem through the neck and down the side of the chest and abdomen. The nerve carries messages from the brain to the body's major organs, including the heart, lungs, and intestines, and between areas of the brain that control mood, sleep, and other functions.\n\nMore recently, this therapy has been simplified by the introduction of noninvasive VNS (known as transcutaneous VNS [tVNS] ). tVNS uses a portable device to send electrical stimulation through the skin to activate the vagus nerve. Although tVNS is still experimental, the approach may offer advantages over surgical VNS, such as greater accessibility and affordability, while avoiding surgical complications.\n\nVNS was initially developed as a treatment for epilepsy. Research using brain scans showed that the procedure also can be used to improve depression symptoms.\n\nIn 2005, the FDA approved surgical VNS for depression when the following conditions are met.\n\nThe patient is 18 years or older. The depression has lasted 2 or more years. The depression is severe or recurrent. The depression has not eased after trying at least four other treatments.\n\nDespite FDA approval for depression, VNS is not intended as a first-line treatment and remains infrequently used. The results of studies examining its effectiveness for depression have been mixed. Whereas a review of clinical trials of VNS for treatment-resistant depression found a sustained reduction in depression symptoms and enhanced quality of life, other studies did not report meaningful improvements.\n\nAlthough noninvasive forms of VNS have shown antidepressant effects , tVNS is not currently authorized by the FDA as a treatment for depression. However, a portable VNS device has been cleared by the FDA to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) under a breakthrough device designation. Research is ongoing to test the efficacy and safety of tVNS for depression, PTSD, and other mental disorders.\n\nA device about the size of a stopwatch called a pulse generator is implanted in the upper left side of the chest while the patient is under anesthesia. Connected to the pulse generator is an electrical lead wire, which goes from the generator to the left vagus nerve. Typically, 30-second electrical pulses are sent every 5 minutes from the generator to the vagus nerve. The duration and frequency of the pulses may vary depending on how the generator is programmed. The vagus nerve, in turn, delivers those electrical signals to the brain.\n\nThe pulse generator, which operates continuously, is powered by a battery that lasts around 10 years, after which it must be replaced. Patients usually do not feel pain or discomfort as the device operates.\n\nIt may be several months before noticing benefits, and not all people respond to VNS. Some patients have no improvement in symptoms, and some may get worse.\n\nThe device can be temporarily deactivated by placing a magnet over the chest where the generator is implanted. A patient may want to deactivate the device if side effects become intolerable or before engaging in strenuous activity or exercise because it can interfere with breathing. The device reactivates when the magnet is removed.\n\nNoninvasive forms of VNS consist of a device worn around the neck or ears or a handheld device. There are many questions about the most effective stimulation sites, parameters, and protocols for tVNS, and research is ongoing to determine the optimal conditions to achieve the greatest clinical benefits.\n\nVNS is not without risk. There may be complications, such as infection or pain from the implant surgery, or the device may come loose, move around, or malfunction, all of which can require additional surgery to correct.\n\nDiscomfort or tingling in the area where the device is implanted Voice changes or hoarseness Cough or sore throat Neck pain or headaches Breathing problems, especially during exercise Difficulty swallowing Nausea or vomiting\n\nIf cleared by the FDA, tVNS devices may help overcome some of these surgical issues. Nonetheless, mild side effects of tVNS have been reported, including:\n\nTingling, pain, or itchiness around the stimulation site Nausea or vomiting Dizziness\n\nThe long-term side effects of all forms of VNS are unknown.\n\nOther brain stimulation therapies are actively being explored for specific mental disorders. The following therapies are still considered experimental and have not yet been authorized by the FDA to treat mental disorders.\n\nMagnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a noninvasive procedure that uses high-powered magnetic stimulation to induce seizures. The seizures are targeted to a specific site in the brain.\n\nIn the United States, MST is available only as part of a clinical trial or research study. NIMH has information on joining a clinical trial of MST or another brain stimulation therapy.\n\nMST combines aspects of both ECT and rTMS. Like rTMS, MST uses magnetic pulses to stimulate a specific brain site. The pulses are given at a higher intensity and frequency than in rTMS to induce a seizure. But the strength of the stimulation is less than in ECT and is also more focused in the brain. Like in ECT, the patient is anesthetized and given a muscle relaxant to prevent movement during the procedure. The goal is to retain the effectiveness of ECT while reducing the risk of cognitive side effects.\n\nAn electromagnetic coil is held against the head, typically targeting the brain’s prefrontal area. Rapidly alternating strong magnetic pulses pass through the coil into the brain to induce a seizure. Anesthesia is used to ensure the patient does not experience pain or feel the electrical pulses. A muscle relaxant is used to prevent the patient from moving during the procedure. The magnetic dosage is individualized for each patient by finding the patient-specific seizure threshold.\n\nThere is not agreement on MST's optimal dosing, coil size, and stimulation site, and researchers are actively conducting studies to determine those specifications.\n\nIntroduced in 2001, MST is currently in the early stages of investigation and clinical use for treating mental disorders. A review of randomized clinical trials examining MST for treatment-resistant depression showed promising results. A recent multicenter clinical study of people with severe depression also showed significant and sustained antidepressant effects of MST and that it was as effective as ECT in treating the disorder, while leading to fewer cognitive side effects.\n\nHowever, more confirmatory evidence is needed to draw conclusions about MST’s effectiveness in treating depression and other mental disorders.\n\nLike ECT, MST carries the risk of side effects caused by anesthesia and the induction of a seizure. These side effects can include:\n\nHeadaches or scalp pain Dizziness Nausea or vomiting Muscle aches or fatigue\n\nA systematic review and meta-analysis found that MST produced fewer memory problems and other cognitive side effects and caused less confusion and shorter seizures compared to ECT.\n\nDeep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical procedure that uses electricity to directly stimulate sites in the brain.\n\nDBS can be used to treat severe OCD or depression in patients who have not responded to other treatments. It is available for other mental disorders only as part of a clinical trial.\n\nDBS works by sending electrical pulses to specific brain areas. It requires surgery to implant electrodes in the brain. Although it is unclear exactly how DBS works, researchers believe it uses electrical pulses to help \"reset\" malfunctioning networks in the brain.\n\nPrior to the procedure, scans of the brain are taken using MRI, which the surgeon uses as a guide to determine where to place the electrodes during surgery.\n\nThe head is numbed with a local anesthetic so they do not feel pain. The surgeon drills one or two small holes into the patient’s head; threads a thin insulated wire, usually a pair of wires, through the hole(s) and into the brain; and places electrodes in a specific brain area. The patient is awake while the electrodes are implanted to provide feedback on their placement but does not feel pain because the head is numbed and the brain itself does not register pain. After the electrodes are implanted, the patient is put under general anesthesia. The electrodes are attached to wires that run inside the body from the head, through the neck and shoulder, and down to the chest, where a small battery-operated generator (about the size of a pacemaker) is implanted. The generator is placed under the skin in the upper chest. Whereas early DBS devices used two pulse generators, one wired to each of the implanted electrodes, most newer devices use a single pulse generator to stimulate both electrodes. From the generator, electrical pulses are delivered through the wires to the electrodes in the brain. Stimulation is applied continuously, and its frequency and level are customized to each patient.\n\nAfter the procedure, the patient may be given a device-based tool (like a hand-held controller or smart phone app) to help them monitor and manage their symptoms at home or provide feedback to their care team.\n\nDBS was first developed to treat movement disorders , including tremor and Parkinson's disease.\n\nThe FDA has since cleared DBS for severe, treatment-resistant OCD under a Humanitarian Device Exemption , which is a provision for rare diseases or conditions experienced by relatively few patients among whom it has been difficult to gather evidence to demonstrate effectiveness. However, there is still much to be learned about optimizing DBS treatment. Although a systematic review found that DBS improves OCD symptoms, other review articles have called for more confirmatory evidence before drawing conclusions about its effectiveness.\n\nSimilarly, DBS received Breakthrough Device Designation from the FDA in 2022 to investigate its use for treatment-resistant depression. A systematic review and meta-analysis showed favorable effects of DBS in treating depression symptoms. Nonetheless, it remains an experimental treatment for depression until more data from high-quality studies are available.\n\nDBS carries risks associated with any brain surgery. For example, the procedure may lead to:\n\nBleeding in the brain or stroke Device-related discomfort, pain, or infection around the incision Infection near the incision site Headaches Disorientation or confusion Cognitive impairment Lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, or vomiting Trouble sleeping, agitation, or restlessness\n\nBecause the procedure is still being studied, other side effects not yet identified are possible. Long-term benefits and side effects are unknown.\n\nOther types of brain stimulation therapy are in development. Most are used in combination with other therapies or treatments to optimize clinical outcomes.\n\nOne emerging therapy that shows promise for treating mental disorders is trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) . The FDA has approved TNS to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, but it has not yet been approved to treat other conditions or for adults.\n\nOther noninvasive brain stimulation therapies include, but are not limited to:\n\nTemporal interference (TI) Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS)\n\nSeveral groups at NIMH conduct research on brain stimulation therapies. The Neuromodulation and Neurostimulation Program and Multimodal Neurotherapeutics Program support research to develop new therapies and refine existing therapies to treat mental disorders and conditions. The Noninvasive Neuromodulation Unit examines the mechanisms of action of treatments for brain-based disorders to develop safer, more effective, and personalized interventions for serious mental health conditions.\n\nNIMH supports a wide range of research, including clinical trials that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions. The goal of a clinical trial is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe. Although people may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, they should know that the primary purpose is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others can be better helped in the future.\n\nResearchers at NIMH and around the country conduct many studies with people with and without mental disorders. We have new and better treatment options today because of what clinical trials have uncovered. Talk to a health care provider about clinical trials, their benefits and risks, and whether one is right for you.\n\nResearch Conducted at NIMH: Join a Study NIMH Clinical Trials – Information for Participants ClinicalTrials.gov: Brain Stimulation Therapies\n\nTo learn more about the mental disorders discussed on this page, visit NIMH’s health topic webpages.\n\nBrain Stimulation Therapies (NIMH Facebook Live) Electroconvulsive Therapy (MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia) Deep Brain Stimulation (MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia) Brain Stimulation Therapies for Epilepsy (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke) Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for the Treatment of Parkinson’s Disease and Other Movement Disorders (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke)\n\nJournal articles : References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine) Magnetic Seizure Therapy as Effective as Electroconvulsive Therapy for Treating Depression (NIMH Research Highlight) New Approach Allows Magnetic Brain Stimulation to Target Deep Brain Structures (NIMH Research Highlight) Personalizing Deep Brain Stimulation for Treatment-Resistant Depression (NIMH Research Highlight)\n\nUnless otherwise specified, the information on our website and in our publications is in the public domain and may be reused or copied without permission.

    "content": "Mental health includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It is more than the absence of a mental illness—it’s essential to your overall health and quality of life. Self-care can play a role in maintaining your mental health and help support your treatment and recovery if you have a mental illness.\n\nSelf-care means taking the time to do things that help you live well and improve both your physical health and mental health. This can help you manage stress, lower your risk of illness, and increase your energy. Even small acts of self-care in your daily life can have a big impact.\n\nGet regular exercise. Just 30 minutes of walking every day can boost your mood and improve your health. Small amounts of exercise add up, so don’t be discouraged if you can’t do 30 minutes at one time. Eat healthy, regular meals and stay hydrated. A balanced diet and plenty of water can improve your energy and focus throughout the day. Pay attention to your intake of caffeine and alcohol and how they affect your mood and well-being—for some, decreasing caffeine and alcohol consumption can be helpful. Make sleep a priority. Stick to a schedule, and make sure you’re getting enough sleep. Blue light from devices and screens can make it harder to fall asleep, so reduce blue light exposure from your phone or computer before bedtime. Try a relaxing activity. Explore relaxation or wellness programs or apps, which may incorporate meditation, muscle relaxation, or breathing exercises. Schedule regular times for these and other healthy activities you enjoy, such as listening to music, reading, spending time in nature, and engaging in low-stress hobbies. Set goals and priorities. Decide what must get done now and what can wait. Learn to say “no” to new tasks if you start to feel like you’re taking on too much. Try to appreciate what you have accomplished at the end of the day. Practice gratitude. Remind yourself daily of things you are grateful for. Be specific. Write them down or replay them in your mind. Focus on positivity. Identify and challenge your negative and unhelpful thoughts. Stay connected. Reach out to friends or family members who can provide emotional support and practical help.\n\nSelf-care looks different for everyone, and it is important to find what you need and enjoy.

    "content": "La salud mental incluye el bienestar emocional, psicológico y social. Es más que la ausencia de una enfermedad mental, es esencial tanto para su salud en general como para su calidad de vida. El autocuidado puede ser clave para mantener su salud mental y sirve de apoyo para su tratamiento y recuperación, en caso de que tenga alguna enfermedad mental.\n\nEl autocuidado significa dedicar tiempo a hacer cosas que le ayudan a vivir bien y a mejorar su salud física y mental. Esto puede ayudarle a controlar el estrés, disminuir su riesgo de contraer enfermedades y aumentar su nivel de energía. Hasta algunas acciones pequeñas de autocuidado en su vida diaria pueden generar un gran impacto.\n\nLos siguientes son algunos consejos para ayudarle a comenzar a cuidarse a sí mismo:\n\nHaga ejercicio con regularidad. Tan solo 30 minutos de caminatas diarias pueden ayudarle a mejorar su estado de ánimo y su salud. Si no puede hacer 30 minutos de una sola vez, ¡no se desanime! Haga pequeñas cantidades de ejercicio durante el día y estas se irán sumando. Consuma alimentos saludables y comidas con regularidad, y manténgase hidratado. Una dieta balanceada y mucha agua pueden aumentar su nivel de energía y de atención a lo largo del día. Preste atención a su consumo de cafeína y alcohol, y a cómo afectan su estado de ánimo y bienestar. Para algunas personas, disminuir el consumo de cafeína y alcohol puede ayudar. Dele prioridad al sueño. Establezca un horario y asegúrese de dormir suficiente tiempo. La luz azul que emiten diversos dispositivos y pantallas puede hacer que sea más difícil conciliar el sueño. Por eso, reduzca su grado de exposición a la luz azul de su teléfono o de su computadora antes de que llegue la hora de dormir. Intente practicar una actividad relajante. Explore diversos programas o aplicaciones móviles de relajación o bienestar que podrían incorporar meditación, relajación muscular o ejercicios de respiración. Programe un horario regular para estas y otras actividades saludables que disfrute, como escuchar música, leer, pasar tiempo en la naturaleza, y practicar pasatiempos con un nivel bajo de estrés. Establezca metas y prioridades. Decida lo que debe hacerse en este momento y lo que puede esperar. Aprenda a decir “no” a nuevas tareas si empieza a sentir que está asumiendo demasiadas cosas. Intente apreciar lo que ha logrado al final del día, en lugar de lo que no ha podido hacer. Practique la gratitud. Recuerde diariamente cosas por las que está agradecido. Sea específico. Anótelas o repítalas mentalmente. Centre su atención en las cosas positivas. Identifique y cuestione sus pensamientos negativos y poco útiles. Manténgase en contacto con los demás. Comuníquese con sus amigos o familiares que puedan ofrecerle apoyo emocional y ayuda práctica.\n\nEl autocuidado es diferente para todos y es importante descubrir qué es lo que usted necesita y disfruta. Podría ser necesario intentar diferentes cosas hasta descubrir qué funciona mejor para usted.\n\nAprenda más sobre prácticas saludables para la mente y el cuerpo .\n\nBusque ayuda profesional si tiene síntomas graves o de angustia que han durado dos semanas o más, como:\n\ndificultad para dormir cambios en su apetito o altibajos no planificados en su peso dificultad para levantarse de la cama en la mañana debido a su estado de ánimo dificultad para concentrase pérdida de interés en cosas que por lo general le divierten inhabilidad de realizar sus funciones y cumplir con sus responsabilidades diarias sentimientos de irritabilidad, frustración o inquietud\n\nSi tiene dudas sobre su salud mental, hable con su médico u otro proveedor de atención primaria.

Traumatic events can include experiences such as natural disasters (such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods), acts of violence (such as assault, abuse, terror attacks, and mass shootings), and car crashes or other accidents.\n\nIt is natural to feel afraid during and after a traumatic situation. Fear is a part of the body’s “fight-or-flight” response, which helps us avoid or respond to potential danger. People may experience a range of reactions after trauma, including:\n\nFeeling anxious, sad, or angry Trouble concentrating and sleeping Continually thinking about what happened\n\nMost people will recover from these symptoms, and their reactions will lessen over time. Those who continue to experience symptoms may be diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nIt is important to seek professional help if symptoms do not improve over time or begin to interfere with daily life. Some signs that a person may need help include:\n\nWorrying a lot or feeling very anxious, sad, or fearful Crying often Having trouble thinking clearly Having frightening thoughts or flashbacks, reliving the experience Feeling angry, resentful, or irritable Having nightmares or difficulty sleeping Avoiding places or people that bring back disturbing memories and responses Becoming isolated from family and friends\n\nPhysical responses to trauma may also mean that a person needs help. Physical symptoms may include:\n\nHaving headaches Having stomach pain and digestive issues Having difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep Having a racing heart and sweating Being very jumpy and easily startled\n\nPeople who have a personal or family history of mental illness or substance use, who have had previous exposure to traumatic experiences, who face ongoing stress or trauma (such as abuse), or who lack support from friends and family may be more likely to develop more severe symptoms and need additional help.\n\nPeople who experience traumatic events also may experience panic disorder, depression, substance use, or suicidal thoughts. Treatment for these conditions can help with recovery after trauma.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or having thoughts of suicide, call or text the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org . In life-threatening situations, call 911.\n\nChildren can have extreme reactions to traumatic events, but their symptoms may not be the same as those seen in adults. In children younger than age 6, symptoms can include:\n\nWetting the bed after having learned to use the toilet Forgetting how to talk or being unable to talk Acting out the scary event during playtime Being unusually clingy with a parent or other adult\n\nOlder children and teens usually show symptoms more like those seen in adults. They may also develop disruptive, disrespectful, or destructive behaviors. Older children and teens may feel guilt over not preventing injury or death or have thoughts of revenge.\n\nHealthy ways of coping can help reduce stress and improve well-being. Here are some things you can do to help yourself:\n\nAvoid the use of alcohol or drugs Spend time with trusted friends and relatives who are supportive Try to maintain routines for meals, exercise, and sleep Engage in exercise, mindfulness, or other activities that help reduce stress Set realistic goals and focus on what you can manage\n\nLearn about self-care strategies and when to seek professional help.\n\nIf you have concerns about your mental health, talk to a primary care provider. They can refer you to a qualified mental health professional, such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, or clinical social worker, who can help you figure out the next steps. Find tips for talking with a health care provider about your mental health.\n\nYou can learn more about getting help on the NIMH website. You can also learn about finding support and locating mental health services in your area on the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) website.\n\nIn addition, SAMHSA’s Disaster Distress Helpline provides crisis counseling and support to people experiencing emotional distress related to natural or human-caused disasters. The helpline is free, multilingual, confidential, and available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nClinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions. The goal of clinical trials is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe. Although individuals may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, participants should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others may be better helped in the future.\n\nResearchers at NIMH and around the country conduct many studies with patients and healthy volunteers. We have new and better treatment options today because of what clinical trials uncovered years ago. Talk to your health care provider about clinical trials, their benefits and risks, and whether one is right for you.\n\nNIMH’s Clinical Trials webpage: Information about participating in clinical trials Clinicaltrials.gov: Current Studies on Coping with Trauma : List of clinical trials funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) being conducted across the country\n\nHelping Children and Adolescents Cope With Traumatic Events: This fact sheet presents information on how children and adolescents respond to traumatic events and what family, friends, and trusted adults can do to help.

    "content": "Medications can play an important role in treating mental disorders and conditions. They are often used in combination with other treatments, such as psychotherapy and brain stimulation therapy. Medications can affect people in different ways, and it may take several tries to find the medication that works best with the fewest side effects. It’s important to work with a health care provider or a mental health professional to develop a treatment plan that meets your individual needs and medical situation.\n\nInformation about medications is updated frequently. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has Medication Guides with the latest information, warnings, and approved medications. MedlinePlus also provides information on drugs, herbs, and supplements , including side effects and warnings.\n\nThis page provides basic information on mental health medications. It is not a complete source for all medications available. It should not be used as a guide when making medical decisions.\n\nAntidepressants are medications used to treat depression. In some cases, health care providers may prescribe antidepressants to treat other health conditions, such as anxiety, pain , and insomnia .\n\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs)\n\nThese medications are commonly prescribed because they improve the symptoms of a broad group of depressive and anxiety disorders. They are also associated with fewer side effects than older antidepressants. Although older antidepressants, such as tricyclics and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), are associated with more side effects, they may be the best option for some people.\n\nAntidepressants take time—usually 4−8 weeks—to work, and problems with sleep, appetite, energy, and concentration often improve before mood lifts. Giving a medication a chance to work is important before deciding whether it is right for you.\n\nCommon side effects of SSRIs and other antidepressants include upset stomach, headache, or sexual dysfunction. The side effects are generally mild and tend to go away with time. People who are sensitive to the side effects of these medications sometimes benefit from starting with a low dose, increasing the daily dose very slowly, and changing when or how they take the medication (for example, at bedtime or with food).\n\nEsketamine is an FDA-approved medication for treatment-resistant depression, which may be diagnosed when a person’s symptoms do not improve after trying at least two antidepressants. Esketamine is delivered as a nasal spray in a health care provider’s office, a clinic, or a hospital. It often acts rapidly, typically within a couple of hours, to relieve depression symptoms. People usually continue to take an oral antidepressant to maintain the improvement in their symptoms.\n\nCombining antidepressants with other medications or supplements that act on the serotonin system, such as triptans (often used to treat migraine headaches) and St. John’s wort (a dietary supplement), can cause a rare but life-threatening illness called serotonin syndrome . Symptoms of serotonin syndrome include agitation, muscle twitches, hallucinations (seeing or hearing things others do not see or hear), high temperature, and unusual blood pressure changes. For most people, the risk of such extreme reactions is low. It is important for health care providers to consider all possible interactions and use extra care in prescribing and monitoring medication combinations that have an above-average risk.\n\nNote: In some cases, children, teenagers, and young adults under 25 may experience an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in the first few weeks after starting the medication or when the dose is changed. People of all ages taking antidepressants should be watched closely, especially during the first few weeks of treatment.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or having thoughts of suicide, call or text the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org . In life-threatening situations, call 911.\n\nAnti-anxiety medications help reduce symptoms of anxiety, such as panic attacks and extreme fear and worry.\n\nMany medications used to treat depression—including SSRIs and SNRIs—may also be used to treat anxiety. In the case of panic disorder or social anxiety disorder, health care providers typically start with SSRIs or other antidepressants as the initial treatment because they have fewer side effects than other medications.\n\nBenzodiazepines are another common type of anti-anxiety medication used to treat some short-term anxiety symptoms. They are sometimes used to treat generalized anxiety disorder.\n\nHealth care providers may also prescribe beta-blockers off-label to treat short-term anxiety symptoms, even though the medication is not approved for that specific purpose. For instance, people with a phobia—an overwhelming and unreasonable fear of an object or situation like spiders or public speaking—often experience intense physical symptoms, such as rapid heart rate, sweating, and tremors. Beta-blockers can help manage these symptoms.\n\nBenzodiazepines and beta-blockers are useful as needed to reduce severe anxiety in the short-term. However, taking benzodiazepines over long periods may lead to drug tolerance or even dependence. To avoid these problems, health care providers usually prescribe benzodiazepines for short periods and taper them slowly to reduce the likelihood of withdrawal symptoms or renewed anxiety symptoms. Beta-blockers generally are not recommended for people with asthma or diabetes because they may worsen the symptoms of both conditions.\n\nBuspirone is a different type of anti-anxiety medication that can be used to treat anxiety over longer periods. In contrast to benzodiazepines, buspirone must be taken every day for 3−4 weeks to reach its full effect, and it is not effective for treating anxiety on an as-needed basis.\n\nHealth care providers may prescribe stimulant medications to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy . Stimulants increase alertness, attention, and energy. They can also elevate blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing.\n\nPrescription stimulants improve alertness and focus for most people, regardless of diagnosis. These medications can markedly improve daily functioning for people with significant focus problems, such as people with ADHD. Although motor hyperactivity associated with ADHD in children usually goes away by the time they reach adolescence, people with ADHD may continue to experience inattention and have difficulty focusing into adulthood. As such, stimulant medications can be helpful for adults, as well as for children and adolescents, with ADHD.\n\nStimulants are safe when taken under a health care provider’s supervision and used as directed. Some children may report feeling slightly different or unlike their usual selves while taking the medication. Most side effects of stimulants are minor and not seen at low doses.\n\nSome parents worry that stimulants may lead to misuse or dependence, but evidence shows this is unlikely when the medications are used as prescribed. Other challenges with stimulant treatment, such as sleep disturbance and slowed growth, can generally be safely managed by a health care provider.\n\nAntipsychotic medications are typically used to treat psychosis, a condition that involves some loss of contact with reality. People experiencing a psychotic episode often experience delusions (false beliefs) or hallucinations. Psychosis can be related to drug use or a mental disorder such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or severe depression (also known as psychotic depression).\n\nHealth care providers may also prescribe antipsychotics in combination with other medications to relieve symptoms of delirium , dementia , or other mental health conditions that are more common in older adults. The FDA requires that all antipsychotics include a black box warning stating that the medications are associated with increased rates of stroke and death in older adults with dementia.\n\nOlder, first-generation antipsychotic medications are sometimes called typical antipsychotics (or neuroleptics). Long-term use of typical antipsychotics may lead to a condition involving uncontrollable muscle movements called tardive dyskinesia , which can range from mild to severe. People who think they might have tardive dyskinesia should check with a health care provider before stopping their medication.\n\nNewer, second-generation medications are sometimes called atypical antipsychotics. Several atypical antipsychotics are available. They are commonly used because they treat a broader range of symptoms compared with older medications. For example, atypical antipsychotics are sometimes used to treat bipolar depression or depression in people that have not responded to antidepressant medication alone. Health care providers may ask people taking atypical antipsychotics to participate in regular monitoring of weight, glucose levels, and lipid levels.\n\nSome symptoms, such as agitation and hallucinations, typically go away within days of starting antipsychotic medication. Other symptoms, such as delusions, usually go away within a few weeks. However, people may not experience the full effects of antipsychotic medication for up to 6 weeks.\n\nIf a person’s symptoms do not improve with usual antipsychotic medications, they may be prescribed an atypical antipsychotic called clozapine . People who take clozapine must have regular blood tests to check for a potentially dangerous side effect that occurs in 1%–2% of people.\n\nMood stabilizers are typically used to treat bipolar disorder and mood changes associated with other mental disorders. In some cases, health care providers may prescribe mood stabilizers to augment the effect of other medications used to treat depression.\n\nLithium , an effective mood stabilizer, is approved for the treatment of mania and bipolar disorder. Some studies indicate that lithium may reduce the risk of suicide among people taking it for long-term symptom maintenance. Health care providers generally ask people who are taking lithium to participate in regular monitoring to check lithium levels and kidney and thyroid function.\n\nMood stabilizers are sometimes used to treat depression (usually along with an antidepressant), schizoaffective disorder, disorders of impulse control, and certain mental illnesses in children. For people with bipolar depression, health care providers typically prescribe a mood stabilizer and an antidepressant to reduce the risk of switching into mania (known as rapid cycling).\n\nSome anticonvulsant medications may also be used as mood stabilizers, as they work better than lithium for certain people, such as people with “mixed” symptoms of mania and depression or those with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder. Health care providers generally ask people taking anticonvulsants to participate in regular monitoring to check medication levels and assess side effects and potential interactions with other common medications.\n\nPeople respond to medications in different ways, and it may take several tries to find the medication that is most effective with the fewest side effects. In some cases, people find that a medication helps for a while and then their symptoms return. It often takes some time for a medication to work, so it is important to stick with the treatment plan and take medication as prescribed.\n\nPeople should not stop taking a prescribed medication, even if they are feeling better, without the help of a health care provider. A provider can adjust the treatment plan to slowly and safely decrease the medication dose. It’s important to give the body time to adjust to the change. Stopping a medication too soon may cause unpleasant or harmful side effects.\n\nTell a health care provider about all other medications, vitamins, and supplements you are already taking. Remind a health care provider about any allergies. Tell them about any problems you had with medications in the past. Make sure you understand how to take the medication before you start using it, and take the medication as instructed. Talk to a health care provider about possible side effects and what to expect when taking a medication. Do not take medications prescribed for another person. Do not give your prescribed medication to someone else. Call a health care provider right away if you have problems with your medication or are worried that it might be doing more harm than good. The provider will work with you to address the problems and determine next steps. Report serious side effects to the FDA MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting Program .\n\nThe FDA is responsible for protecting public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of medications, biological products, and medical devices. Contact FDA MedWatch to voluntarily report a:\n\nSerious adverse effect Product quality problem Product use error Product failure that you suspect is associated with an FDA-regulated drug, biologic, medical device, dietary supplement, or cosmetic\n\nYou or a health care provider can make a report online or by calling 1-800-332-1088. You can also report suspected counterfeit medical products to the FDA through MedWatch.\n\nFDA MedWatch also offers several ways to help stay informed about medical products. You can sign up to receive the MedWatch E-list , which delivers safety information to your email. You can also follow MedWatch on X (formerly Twitter) @FDAMedWatch .\n\nNIMH is the lead federal agency for research on mental disorders.

    "title": "Psychotherapies",
    "url": "https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies",
    "content": "Psychotherapy (also called talk therapy) refers to a variety of treatments that aim to help a person identify and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. Most psychotherapy takes place one-on-one with a licensed mental health professional or with other patients in a group setting.\n\nPsychotherapy and medication are the most common forms of mental health treatment. NIMH has information on mental health medications.\n\nIn general, the goals of psychotherapy are to gain relief from symptoms, maintain or enhance daily functioning, and improve quality of life.\n\nYou or someone you know might seek out psychotherapy for many reasons, including:\n\nDealing with severe or long-term stress from a job or family situation, the loss of a loved one, or relationship or family problems Having symptoms with no physical explanation, such as changes in sleep or appetite, low energy, lack of interest or pleasure in activities you once enjoyed, persistent irritability, excessive worry, or a sense of discouragement or hopelessness that won’t go away A health care provider suspecting you have or diagnosing you with a mental disorder that is interfering with your life Supporting a child or family member who has been diagnosed with a condition affecting their mental health\n\nFirst being examined by a health care provider can help rule out a physical health issue. This step is important because sometimes symptoms, like a change in mood or trouble concentrating, are due to a medical condition.\n\nPsychotherapy can be used as an alternative to or alongside medication and other treatment options. Choosing the right treatment plan is based on a person's individual needs and medical situation and should occur under the guidance of a mental health professional.\n\nEven when medication relieves symptoms, psychotherapy can help address specific issues. These might include self-defeating ways of thinking; irrational fears; problems interacting with other people; or difficulty coping with situations at home, school, or work.\n\nA variety of psychotherapies have been shown to effectively treat mental health disorders. Often, the type of treatment is tailored to the specific disorder. For example, the treatment approach for someone who has obsessive-compulsive disorder is different than the approach for someone who has bipolar disorder. Therapists may use one primary approach or incorporate elements from multiple approaches depending on their training, the disorder being treated, and the needs of the person receiving treatment.\n\nElements of psychotherapy can include the following:\n\nHelp a person become aware of automatic ways of thinking that are inaccurate or harmful (for example, having a low opinion of their abilities) and then question those thoughts, understand how the thoughts affect their emotions and behavior, and change self-defeating behavior patterns. This approach is known as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Identify ways to cope with stress and develop problem-solving strategies. Examine interactions with others and teach social and communication skills. Apply mindfulness and relaxation techniques, such as meditation and breathing exercises. Use exposure therapy (a type of CBT) for anxiety disorders, in which a person spends brief periods in a supportive environment learning to tolerate the distress caused by certain items, ideas, or imagined scenes. This is continued until, over time, the fear associated with those things goes down. Track emotions and behaviors to raise awareness of their impact on each other. Use supportive counseling to explore troubling issues and receive emotional support. Create a safety plan to help with thoughts of self-harm or suicide, recognize warning signs, and use coping strategies, such as contacting friends, family, or emergency personnel.\n\nThere are many types of psychotherapy. Therapies are often variations of an established approach, such as CBT. There is no formal approval process for psychotherapies like there is for medications by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nHowever, for many therapies, research involving large numbers of patients has provided evidence that the treatment is effective. These evidence-based therapies have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, and other mental disorders. NIMH's health topic pages list some of the evidence-based therapies used to treat specific disorders.\n\nTherapists have different professional backgrounds and specialties. The approach a therapist uses depends on their training and experience and the disorder being treated. This section and the next provide information that can help you find a therapist’s credentials and resources for locating therapists.\n\nOnce you have identified one or more possible therapists, a preliminary conversation can help you understand how treatment will proceed and if you feel comfortable with the therapist. Rapport and trust are essential. Discussions in therapy are deeply personal, and it’s important that you feel comfortable with the therapist and have confidence in their expertise. These preliminary conversations may happen in person, by phone, or virtually.\n\nWhat are the credentials and experience of the therapist? Does the therapist have a specialty? What approach will the therapist use to help you? Do they practice a particular type of therapy? What is the rationale for the therapy and its evidence base? Does the therapist have experience in diagnosing and treating the age group (for example, a child) and the specific condition? If the patient is a child, how will parents or caregivers be involved in treatment? What are the goals of therapy? Does the therapist recommend a specific time frame or number of sessions? How will progress be assessed? What happens if you (or the therapist) feel you aren't starting to improve? Are medications an option? Is this therapist able to prescribe medications? Are meetings confidential? How is confidentiality assured? Are there limits to confidentiality?\n\nIf you have been in therapy for what feels like a reasonable amount of time and are not getting better, talk to your therapist. You might want to explore other mental health professionals or approaches.\n\nMany types of professionals offer psychotherapy. Examples include psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, counselors, and psychiatric nurses. Information on providers’ credentials is available from the National Alliance on Mental Illness and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration .\n\nNIMH has information on ways to get help, find a health care provider, and access treatment, including reduced-cost health services. Your health insurance provider may also have a list of specific mental health professionals participating in your plan.\n\nWhen talking with a prospective therapist, ask about treatment fees, whether the therapist accepts insurance, and whether there is a sliding scale for fees according to income.\n\nThe following professional organizations have directories or locators on their websites for finding mental health professionals:\n\nAcademy of Cognitive and Behavioral Therapies American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy American Board of Clinical Social Work American Board of Professional Psychology American Psychiatric Association American Psychological Association Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies National Association of Social Workers National Register of Health Service Psychologists Psychology Today Society of Clinical Psychology\n\nNational advocacy organizations provide information on finding mental health professionals, and some have locators for finding a therapist on their websites. Examples include:\n\nAnxiety & Depression Association of America Attention Deficit Disorder Association Children and Adults With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance International OCD Foundation Mental Health America National Alliance on Mental Illness\n\nNote: NIMH does not evaluate the professional qualifications and competencies of individual practitioners listed on these websites. These resources are provided for informational purposes only. They are not comprehensive lists, and an organization’s inclusion does not constitute an endorsement by NIMH, the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or the U.S. government.\n\nMany universities or medical schools have affiliated programs that offer treatment options, including training clinics. You can find these programs by searching the website of local university health centers for their psychiatry or psychology departments. You can also go to the website for the health department in your state or county to look for mental health-related programs they might offer.\n\nThe telephone, the internet, and mobile devices have created new opportunities for readily available and accessible treatment, including in areas where mental health professionals may not be physically available. Some of these approaches involve a therapist providing help at a distance. Others, such as web-based programs and mobile apps, are designed to provide immediate information and feedback in the absence of a therapist.\n\nNIMH provides information on and examples of technology used for mental health treatment.\n\nChildren and Mental Health: Is This Just a Stage?

    "title": "Substance Use and Co-Occurring Mental Disorders",
    "url": "https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/substance-use-and-mental-health",
    "content": "Substance use disorder (SUD) is a treatable mental disorder that affects a person’s brain and behavior, leading to their inability to control their use of substances like legal or illegal drugs, alcohol, or medications. Symptoms can be moderate to severe, with addiction being the most severe form of SUD.\n\nPeople with a SUD may also have other mental health disorders, and people with mental health disorders may also struggle with substance use. These other mental health disorders can include anxiety disorders, depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, personality disorders, and schizophrenia, among others.\n\nThough people might have both a SUD and a mental disorder, that does not mean that one caused the other. Research suggests three possibilities that could explain why SUDs and other mental disorders may occur together:\n\nCommon risk factors can contribute to both SUDs and other mental disorders. Both SUDs and other mental disorders can run in families, meaning certain genes may be a risk factor. Environmental factors, such as stress or trauma, can cause genetic changes that are passed down through generations and may contribute to the development of a mental disorder or a substance use disorder. Mental disorders can contribute to substance use and SUDs. Studies found that people with a mental disorder, such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), may use drugs or alcohol as a form of self-medication. However, although some drugs may temporarily help with some symptoms of mental disorders, they may make the symptoms worse over time. Additionally, brain changes in people with mental disorders may enhance the rewarding effects of substances, making it more likely they will continue to use the substance. Substance use and SUDs can contribute to the development of other mental disorders. Substance use may trigger changes in brain structure and function that make a person more likely to develop a mental disorder.\n\nWhen someone has a SUD and another mental health disorder, it is usually better to treat them at the same time rather than separately. People who need help for a SUD and other mental disorders should see a health care provider for each disorder. It can be challenging to make an accurate diagnosis because some symptoms are the same for both disorders, so the provider should use comprehensive assessment tools to reduce the chance of a missed diagnosis and provide the right treatment.\n\nIt also is essential that the provider tailor treatment, which may include behavioral therapies and medications, to an individual’s specific combination of disorders and symptoms. It should also take into account the person’s age, the misused substance, and the specific mental disorder(s). Talk to your health care provider to determine what treatment may be best for you and give the treatment time to work.\n\nResearch has found several behavioral therapies that have promise for treating individuals with co-occurring substance use and mental disorders. Health care providers may recommend behavioral therapies alone or in combination with medications.\n\nSome examples of effective behavioral therapies for adults with SUDs and different co-occurring mental disorders include:\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of talk therapy aimed at helping people learn how to cope with difficult situations by challenging irrational thoughts and changing behaviors. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) uses concepts of mindfulness and acceptance or being aware of and attentive to the current situation and emotional state. DBT also teaches skills that can help control intense emotions, reduce self-destructive behaviors (such as suicide attempts, thoughts, or urges; self-harm; and drug use), and improve relationships. Assertive community treatment (ACT) is a form of community-based mental health care that emphasizes outreach to the community and an individualized treatment approach. Therapeutic communities (TC) are a common form of long-term residential treatment that focuses on helping people develop new and healthier values, attitudes, and behaviors. Contingency management (CM) principles encourage healthy behaviors by offering vouchers or rewards for desired behaviors.\n\nSome effective behavioral treatments for children and adolescents include:\n\nBrief strategic family therapy (BSFT) therapy targets family interactions thought to maintain or worsen adolescent SUDs and other co-occurring problem behaviors. Multidimensional family therapy (MDFT) works with the whole family to simultaneously address multiple and interacting adolescent problem behaviors, such as substance use, mental disorders, school problems, delinquency, and others. Multisystemic therapy (MST) targets key factors associated with serious antisocial behavior in children and adolescents with SUDs.\n\nThere are effective medications that treat opioid , alcohol , and nicotine addiction and lessen the symptoms of many other mental disorders. Some medications may be useful in treating multiple disorders. For more information on behavioral treatments and medications for SUDs, visit NIDA’s Drug Facts and Treatment webpages. For more information about treatment for mental disorders, visit NIMH's Health Topics webpages.\n\nTo find mental health treatment services in your area, call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357), visit the SAMHSA online treatment locator , or text your ZIP code to 435748.\n\nFor additional resources about finding help, visit:\n\nNational Cancer Institute’s Smokefree.gov website, or call their smoking quitline at 1-877-44U-QUIT (1-877-448-7848)\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or having thoughts of suicide, call or text the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org .

The goal of clinical trials is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe. Although individuals may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, participants should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others may be better helped in the future.\n\nResearchers at NIMH and around the country conduct many studies with patients and healthy volunteers.

    "title": "Technology and the Future of Mental Health Treatment",
    "url": "https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/technology-and-the-future-of-mental-health-treatment",
    "content": "Technology has opened a new frontier in mental health care and data collection. Mobile devices like cell phones, smartphones, and tablets are giving the public, health care providers, and researchers new ways to access help, monitor progress, and increase understanding of mental well-being.\n\nMobile mental health support can be very simple but effective. For example, anyone with a phone or computer can call, text, or chat the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at any time.\n\nNew technology can also be packaged into an extremely sophisticated app for smartphones or tablets. Such apps might use the device’s built-in sensors to collect information on a user’s typical behavior patterns. Then, if the app detects a change in behavior, it can signal that help is needed before a crisis occurs.\n\nSome apps are stand-alone programs designed to improve memory or thinking skills. Other apps help people connect to a peer counselor or a health care professional.\n\nExcitement about the huge range of opportunities technology offers for mental health treatment has led to a burst of development. Thousands of mental health apps are available in iTunes and Android app stores, and the number is growing every year. However, this new technology frontier includes a lot of uncertainty. There is very little industry regulation and very little information on app effectiveness, which can lead people to wonder which apps they should trust.\n\nBefore focusing on the state of the science and where it may lead, it’s important to look at the advantages and disadvantages of expanding mental health treatment and research into a mobile world.\n\nMental health apps and other technology have a lot of potential, both for people seeking mental health care and mental health professionals providing such services. Some advantages of mobile care technology include the following.\n\nConvenience: Allows treatment to take place anytime and anywhere, such as at home in the middle of the night or on a bus on the way to work, making it ideal for people who have trouble getting to in-person appointments Anonymity: Lets people receive treatment anonymously and privately from the comfort of their homes Introduction to care: Acts as a good first step for people who have been reluctant to seek mental health care in the past Lower cost: Makes care more affordable through apps that are free or cheaper than traditional in-person care Greater outreach: Helps mental health professionals offer treatment to people in remote areas or to large numbers of people in times of sudden need, like after a natural disaster or traumatic event Interest: Encourages people to continue therapy by making care more appealing and accessible than traditional in-person treatment 24-hour service: Provides around-the-clock monitoring or intervention support Consistency: Offers the same treatment program to all people Support: Complements traditional therapy by extending in-person sessions, reinforcing new skills, and providing support and monitoring Data collection: Collects information, such as location, movement, phone use, and other data\n\nMental health technology offers great opportunities but also raises concerns. Addressing potential problems will be essential to ensuring that new apps provide benefits without causing harm. Although apps are becoming more appealing and user-friendly, we need more information on their effectiveness.\n\nThe following are some limitations of the technology that researchers and developers are trying to answer questions about.\n\nEffectiveness: Is the app supported by scientific evidence showing that it works and works as well as traditional in-person methods? Audience: Does the app work equally well for all people it is meant to help? Privacy: How does the app maker guarantee users’ privacy, considering many apps deal with sensitive personal information? Guidance: How do people determine if an app is effective when no industry-wide standards exist for evaluating quality? Regulation: Who should regulate mental health technology and the data it generates? Overselling: Does the app promise more than it delivers and turn people away from using other, more effective therapies?\n\nResearch and engineering teams are combining their skills to address a wide range of mental health concerns. For instance, intervention apps may help people quit smoking; manage symptoms of anxiety, depression, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress, or insomnia; and more. Some popular areas of app development include the following.\n\nSelf-management apps involve people putting information into the app to receive feedback. For example, they might use the app to set medication reminders or access tools for managing stress, anxiety, or sleep problems. Some software can use additional equipment to track heart rate, breathing patterns, blood pressure, and so forth to help people monitor their progress and receive feedback.\n\nCognitive remediation apps help people improve their thinking skills. These apps are often designed for people with serious mental illnesses who may have distorted or unhelpful ways of thinking or hold inaccurate beliefs.\n\nSkill training apps may feel more like games than other mental health apps as they help people learn new coping or thinking skills. These apps might involve watching an educational video about anxiety management or the importance of social support, for example. People then pick new strategies to try and use the app to track how often they practice those new skills.\n\nIllness management and supported care apps provide additional support by allowing people to interact with another person. The app may connect people with peer support or send information to a trained health care provider who can offer guidance and therapy options. Researchers are working to learn how much human interaction people need for app-based treatments to be effective.\n\nSymptom tracking apps collect data using the sensors built into smartphones. The sensors might record movement patterns, social interactions (such as the number of texts and phone calls), behavior at different times of day, vocal tone and speed, and more. In the future, apps may be able to analyze these data to determine a person’s real-time state of mind. Such apps may also recognize changes in behavior patterns that signal an episode of mania, depression, or psychosis before it occurs. Although an app may not replace a mental health professional, it can alert caregivers when someone needs additional help. The goal is to create apps that support a range of people, including those with serious mental illnesses.\n\nData collection apps gather data without any help from the person using them. Receiving widescale information from many people at the same time can increase researchers’ understanding of mental health and help them develop better interventions.\n\nApps can help conduct research. For example, Dr. Patricia Areán’s pioneering BRIGTHEN study showed that research via a smartphone app is a reality. The BRIGHTEN study was remarkable because it used technology to both deliver treatment and conduct research. In other words, the research team used technology to recruit, screen, enroll, treat, and assess participants. BRIGHTEN was especially exciting because the study showed that technology can be an efficient way to test promising new treatments, while also highlighting the need to make those treatments engaging.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or having thoughts of suicide, call or text the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org . In life-threatening situations, call 911.\n\nDeveloping mental health apps and other technology requires a partnership between mental health professionals and software engineers. Researchers have found that interventions are most effective when people like them, are engaged in them, and want to continue using them. Behavioral health apps work best when they combine engineers’ skills for making an app easy to use and entertaining with providers’ skills for providing effective treatment options. Researchers and engineers are developing and testing apps that do everything from manage medications to teach coping skills to predict when someone may need emotional help.\n\nThere are no review boards, checklists, or widely accepted rules for evaluating or choosing a mental health app or other technology. Most apps do not have peer-reviewed research to support their claims, and it is unlikely that every mental health app will go through a randomized clinical research trial to test its effectiveness. One reason is that testing is a slow process, and technology evolves quickly. By the time an app has been put through rigorous scientific testing, the original technology may be outdated.\n\nCurrently, there are no national standards for evaluating the effectiveness of the hundreds of available mental health apps. People should be cautious about trusting an app. However, there are a few suggestions for finding an app that may work for you:\n\nAsk a trusted health care provider for a recommendation. Some larger providers may offer several apps and collect data on their use. Check to see if the app offers recommendations for what to do if symptoms get worse or there is a psychiatric emergency. Know how to get help if needed. Decide if you want an app that is completely automated versus an app that offers opportunities for contact with a trained professional. Search for information on the app developer, including their credentials and experience. Beware of misleading logos. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has not developed and does not endorse any apps. However, some app developers have unlawfully used the NIMH logo to market their products. Search the PubMed database offered by the National Library of Medicine. This resource contains articles on a wide range of research topics, including mental health app development. If you cannot find information about a particular app, check to see if the app is based on a treatment that has been tested. For example, research has shown that internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is as effective as conventional CBT for disorders that include depression, anxiety, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. Try it. If you’re interested in an app, test it for a few days and decide if it’s easy to use, holds your attention, and is something you want to continue using. An app is only effective if it keeps you engaged.\n\nNIMH has awarded over 400 grants for technology-enhanced mental health interventions. NIMH staff continue to actively review and evaluate research grants related to mental health technology.\n\nThese grants have focused on many areas, including:\n\nFeasibility, efficacy, and effectiveness research, such as developing and refining new treatments and interventions Technology for addressing a wide range of mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, HIV, depression, anxiety, autism, suicide, eating disorders, and trauma Interventions for cognitive issues, illness management, problematic behavior, and health communication More accessible and engaging ways to deliver therapies or skill development (for example, interactive formats or game-like approaches) and apps that work on any device Incorporating real-time, face-to-face contact or remote counseling (phone or online) with peers and professionals to provide a balance between technology and human touch Active and passive mobile assessment and monitoring Artificial intelligence (AI) tools and technologies\n\nA significant portion of NIMH funding for these types of technologies is through the NIMH Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs.\n\nIn addition, NIMH created the National Advisory Mental Health Council workgroup on Opportunities and Challenges of Developing Information Technologies on Behavioral and Social Science Clinical Research to track and guide this rapidly changing area. In 2017, the workgroup released a report reviewing the opportunities for and challenges of using new information technologies to study human behaviors relevant to the NIMH mission.\n\nNIMH voiced its interest in this research area in a 2022 notice of special interest . The notice called for research on the utility and validity of digital health and AI tools and technologies in epidemiological, clinical, and intervention research.\n\nClinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions. The goal of a clinical trial is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe. Although people may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, they should know that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others may be better helped in the future.\n\nResearchers at NIMH and around the country conduct many studies with patients and healthy volunteers.

    "content": "Mental health is an important part of overall health for children as well as adults. For many adults who have mental disorders, symptoms were present—but often not recognized or addressed—in childhood and adolescence. For a young person with symptoms of a mental disorder, the earlier treatment is started, the more effective it can be. Early treatment can help prevent more severe, lasting problems as a child grows up.\n\nIt can be tough to tell if troubling behavior in a child is just part of growing up or a problem that should be discussed with a health professional. But if there are behavioral signs and symptoms that last weeks or months, and if these issues interfere with the child’s daily life at home and at school, or with friends, you should contact a health professional.\n\nYounger children may benefit from an evaluation and treatment if they:\n\nHave frequent tantrums or are intensely irritable much of the time Often seem fearful or worried Complain about frequent stomachaches or headaches with no known medical cause Are in constant motion and cannot sit quietly (except when they are watching videos or playing video games) Sleep too much or too little, have frequent nightmares, or seem sleepy during the day Are not interested in playing with other children or have difficulty making friends Struggle academically or have experienced a recent decline in grades Repeat actions or check things many times (for example, repeatedly checking that a door is locked) out of fear that something bad may happen\n\nOlder children and adolescents may benefit from an evaluation if they:\n\nHave lost interest in things that they used to enjoy Have low energy Sleep too much or too little, or seem sleepy throughout the day Have periods of highly elevated energy and activity and require much less sleep than usual Spend more and more time alone, and avoid social activities with friends or family Diet or exercise excessively, or fear gaining weight Engage in self-harm behaviors (such as cutting or burning their skin) Smoke, drink alcohol, or use drugs Engage in risky or destructive behavior alone or with friends Have thoughts of suicide Say that they think someone is trying to control their mind or that they hear things that other people cannot hear\n\nMental illnesses can be treated. If you are a child or teen, talk to your parents, school counselor, or health care provider. If you are a parent and need help starting a conversation with your child or teen about mental health, find resources for families from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
