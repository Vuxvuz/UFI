See Our Editorial Process Meet Our Review Board Share Feedback I Tried Meditation for My Depression-Here's What I Learned **Find what works for you** By John Loeppky Published on January 09, 2025 Verywell Mind Stocksy I don't know about you but I initially found meditation incredibly difficult to understand. I have a physical disability and multiple mental health conditions, including depression and an anxiety disorder. Even my physical disability, cerebral palsy, is inherently tied to my brain. Some days, to call me a mess is an understatement, but at least my brain damage is visible on a scan. In my mid-20s through five-ish years ago-meditation as a treatment option seemed not just sensible, but inevitable. If everyone else was doing it-even on the Canadian prairies where I live-why wasn't I? However, when I was first asked to try mindfulness meditation, I was at a loss. What do you mean you want me to sit here, and imagine the traffic floating by, and contemplate my thoughts without getting into those imaginary cars? What if I wanted to get into one of those cars? What if they were going somewhere cool? What if the vehicle was self-driving? What if they were going to San Francisco? I'd love to go to San Francisco. Sometimes, my mind would float away to my to-do list, or my day job at the time working at an arts non-profit, or the weather, or anything but the calmness I was supposed to focus on. I eventually did find a mindfulness practice that worked for me, yoga nidra, but that was after many months of trial and error. Here's hoping this article can help you find a meditation practice for your mental health a little smoother and easier.\n\n**How Meditation Can Help With Depression**\n\nThe causes of depression are complicated and not fully understood, Some point to genetics, others to physiology, and factors such as stress and anxiety. Brent Nelson, MD, adult interventional psychiatrist and chief medical information officer at PrairieCare, says that for him, the focus on the brain is a helpful framework to understand how meditation can help with depression. The brain has 100 billion neurons with 100 trillion connections, so it's very complicated, Nelson says. And the cause of depression is still yet to be fully understood, but we know it's a complex process. It's often interleaved with other things such as anxiety or trauma, and really, for a lot of people, is a function of stress meeting, maybe, an underlying genetic predisposition. Meditation, when used to treat depression, is not isolated on an island. When suggested by a psychologist, a psychiatrist, or a therapist, meditation is often used alongside medications, methodologies like cognitive-behavioral therapy, and treatments like transcranial magnetic stimulation. Nelson tells Verywell Mind that he often starts patients with mindfulness meditations. A lot of times we will start with mindfulness meditation because what it really can let people do is get their brain to be more connected, kind of in the moment, in the here and now, and less so in the distant past or anxiety over the future, which often can be a challenge in depression, he adds.\n\n**How to Get Started**\n\nJulie Potiker, a certified mindful self-compassion teacher of the UCSD's Center for Mindfulness believes that meditation is a key reason why she was able to recover from her bouts with depression. It's not at all like loosey-goosey or woo woo, or anything like that... I used to be a clinically depressed person, and I used to take antidepressants, and I had postpartum depression, so I'm really a poster child for this...Mindful self-compassion, that's what I leaned into, and that's why I became a teacher of it, and then that's why I became certified in it, she says. Potiker, who tends to focus initially on a loving-kindness meditation, says that zeroing in on self-compassion and gratitude can be especially valuable for those facing depression, in her experience. In terms of getting started, her recent advice to someone she supports-rather than building up meditation to be a big burdensome practice-was to start small. I talked to her about little micro-moments, trying to do it once an hour, Potiker explains. Where you either look out the window or you take a walk, or you play one of your favorite songs, or something that makes your body feel good, and you enrich it and absorb it for moments, I don't mean minutes, and you just really feel because it just folds right into gratitude.\n\n**What Types of Meditation Work Best**\n\nA 2015 analysis looked at seven different meditation techniques and their effectiveness. Those included:\n\n1.  Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy\n2.  Pata√±jali Yoga\n3.  Qigong\n4.  Sahaj Yoga\n5.  Inner Resources Meditation\n6.  Sudarshan Kriya Yoga\n7.  Tai Chi\n\n**Tips for Meditation Success**\n\nMeditation can help mitigate depression symptoms when used in conjunction with a professional treatment plan. Here are some tips to get the most out of your practice:\n\n1.  Speak to a professional about your mental health and meditation practice\n2.  Focus on something you can sustain in the long term\n3.

The Benefits of Meditation for Stress Management - What You Need to Know By Elizabeth Scott, PhD Updated on April 20, 2022 Reviewed by Megan Monahan Alison Czinkota Verywell Table of Contents What is Meditation? Stress Management Health Benefits Pros and Cons Things to Keep in Mind Getting Started Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**The Benefits of Meditation for Stress Management**\n\nMeditation has many benefits, including lowering stress, improving immune function, and slowing mental aging. This age-old practice has become one of the most popular ways to relieve stress among people of all walks of life.\n\n*   Meditation can take many forms and can be combined with many spiritual practices.\n*   It can also be used in several important ways:\n    *   As a part of your daily routine, helping you build resilience to stress\n    *   As a technique to get centered when you're thrown off by emotional stress\n    *   As a quick-fix stress reliever to help you reverse your body's stress response and physically relax\n\n**What is Meditation?**\n\nMeditation is a practice that incorporates different techniques to help people focus their attention and achieve a heightened state of awareness. It can result in changes in consciousness and has been shown to have several health benefits.\n\n*   Meditation involves sitting in a relaxed position and clearing your mind, or focusing your mind on one thought and clearing it of all others.\n*   You may focus on a sound, like \"oommmm,\" or on your breathing, counting, a mantra, or nothing at all.\n*   A common thread among the many meditation techniques is that the mind stops following every new thought that comes to the surface.\n\n**Meditation and Stress**\n\nOne of the main benefits of meditation is its ability to reduce stress. The body's stress response causes the body to automatically react in ways that prepare you to fight or run. However, a prolonged state of such agitation can cause physical damage to every part of the body.\n\n*   Meditation affects the body in exactly the opposite way that stress does-by triggering the body's relaxation response.\n*   It restores the body to a calm state, helping the body repair itself and preventing new damage from the physical effects of stress. \n\n**The Role of Relaxation**\n\nThere is an element of more direct physical relaxation involved in meditation as well, obviously, so this double dose of relaxation can really be helpful for shrugging off stress.\n\n*   Research has shown that those who practice meditation regularly begin to experience changes in their response to stress that allow them to recover from stressful situations more easily and experience less stress from the challenges they face in their everyday lives.\n*   Some of this is thought to be the result of the increase in positive mood that can come from meditation; research shows that those who experience positive moods more often are more resilient toward stress.\n*   Other research has found changes in the brains of regular meditation practitioners that are linked with a decreased reactivity toward stress.\n\n**Health Benefits of Meditation**\n\nThe benefits of meditation are great because, among other things, it can reverse your stress response, thereby shielding you from the effects of chronic stress. When practicing meditation:\n\n*   You use oxygen more efficiently.\n*   Your adrenal glands produce less cortisol.\n*   Your blood pressure normalizes.\n*   Your heart rate and breathing slow down.\n*   Your immune function improves.\n*   Your mind ages at a slower rate.\n*   Your mind clears, and your creativity increases.\n\n**The Pros and Cons of Meditation**\n\nThere are many benefits to meditation, both mentally and physically:\n\n*   People with physical limitations may find it easier to practice than strenuous physical exercise for stress relief.\n*   Plus, no special equipment is required.\n*   Unlike enlisting the help of a professional, meditation is free.\n*   Unlike some medications and herbal therapies, meditation has few potential side effects.\n\nHowever, there are also some things to be aware of before beginning the practice:\n\n*   It does take discipline and commitment to make meditation a regular habit.\n*   Some people may find it more difficult to maintain as a habit than methods that enlist the help of someone or something outside themselves for added motivation.\n*   Some people may have mental or physical health conditions that don't allow them to comfortably meditate while sitting.\n\n**Things to Keep in Mind**\n\nWhen starting your meditation practice, keep the following four things in mind:\n\n1.  Consistency Is Key\n2.  Practice Doesn't Mean Perfect\n3.  It's OK for Your Mind to Wander\n4.  Focus on Your Breath\n\n**Getting Started**\n\nThere are many forms of meditation that bring these fantastic benefits. Two major types of meditation include concentrative meditation (where attention is focused on a specific point) and mindfulness meditation (which focuses on building awareness and acceptance of the present moment).\n\nIf you practice meditation while you are not in the midst of a stressful situation, you will find it easier to use it as a calming technique when you need it. Begin at a relaxed time, even if you plan to use it only as needed and not as a daily exercise.\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n*   When should I meditate? Meditation can be done at any time of day, but it is often easiest to find the time in the morning or evening.\n*   Can meditation help me sleep? Yes, meditation can be very helpful for getting a good night's sleep.\n*   Can you meditate lying down? Yes, you can meditate lying down. What matters more than the meditation posture is if you can hold that posture comfortably for a period of time.\n\n**References**\n\n1.  Meditation affects the body in exactly the opposite way that stress does-by triggering the body's relaxation response.\n2.  Research has shown that those who practice meditation regularly begin to experience changes in their response to stress that allow them to recover from stressful situations more easily and experience less stress from the challenges they face in their everyday lives.\n3.  Some of this is thought to be the result of the increase in positive mood that can come from meditation; research shows that those who experience positive moods more often are more resilient toward stress.\n4.  Other research has found changes in the brains of regular meditation practitioners that are linked with a decreased reactivity toward stress.\n5.  Meditation offers several solutions in one simple activity.\n6.  People who meditate regularly find it easier to give up life-damaging habits like smoking, drinking, and drugs.\n7.  Numerous studies have found that, in diverse populations, meditation can minimize stress and build resilience.\n8.  Some studies suggest that meditation can be harmful to those who have experienced trauma or other serious mental health conditions.\n9.  Research suggests that the amount of time it takes to make a behavior a habit can vary from as little as 18 days to as long as 254 days.‚Äã ‚Äã\n\n**Related Articles**\n\n*   How Long Should You Meditate?\n*   I Tried Meditation for My Depression-Here's What I Learned\n*   LIVING WELL MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION 9 Sources By Elizabeth Scott, PhD Elizabeth Scott, PhD is an author, workshop leader, educator, and award-winning blogger on stress management, positive psychology, relationships, and emotional wellbeing.

We often find ourselves craving some rest and relaxation, so that we can feel restored and rejuvenated. Enter: yoga nidra.\n\nYoga nidra is a guided meditation rooted in ancient yogic traditions that follows a systematic relaxation process, putting us in a very relaxed state that is somewhere between being awake and asleep, says Shelby Harris, PsyD, director of sleep health at Sleepopolis. It's a practice for deep relaxation, healing, integration, and wholeness on all levels of being, says Karla Helbert, an internationally certified yoga therapist (C-IAYT) and author of Tips for Calming Body and Mind: Breathing Lessons.\n\nIf you're curious about yoga nidra, we've got you. In this article, we explore how yoga nidra works, the benefits it offers, and some tips to help you get started with it.\n\n**Tell Me More About Yoga Nidra**\n\nAs old as yoga itself, yoga nidra is a meditative practice that was first recorded in ancient Hindu texts known as the Upanishads, which date as far back as 600 BCE.1 In Sanskrit, the term 'yoga nidra' means 'yogic sleep,' but the practice is really meant to help us hover between a state of sleep and wakefulness-it's essentially awareness in a fully relaxed state, Helbert explains.\n\nIf you're worried it involves something complicated, you can relax (pun intended!). Unlike other forms of yoga, yoga nidra typically doesn't require any complicated asanas, or poses. It simply involves lying down in a comfortable position as your guide takes you through the meditation.\n\nYoga nidra consists of a deceptively simple set of practices for enhancing health, healing, resiliency, and well-being at all levels of body, mind, and spirit, says Richard Miller, PhD, a clinical psychologist and author of Yoga Nidra: The iRest Meditative Practice for Deep Relaxation and Healing.\n\nThere are different styles of yoga nidra, but all include a body scan and an awareness of breath, says Helbert. She adds that many may also include imagery or visualizations of different kinds, such as nature, colors, or representations of the elements, like earth, air, water, or fire.\n\nYoga nidra moves us through each layer of our being-physical, mental, energetic, intuitive, and spiritual-allowing us to experience the inner peace that yoga teaches us is always part of each one of us. - KARLA HELBERT, C-IAYT\n\n**How Yoga Nidra Works**\n\nWhile many other forms of meditation help us relax, yoga nidra represents a unique state where we're fully conscious but we demonstrate all the symptoms of a deep, non-REM sleep with delta brain waves.2 Helbert explains that in this state, the parasympathetic nervous system-the rest, relax, and digest side of our nervous system-is activated, and the sympathetic nervous system-the fight or flight mode-is able to deactivate.1\n\nThe mind remains awake and aware, open and receptive to the messages of healing and creativity shared during the meditation, Helbert adds. She explains that this is powerful because the words, images, and suggestions of healing can sink deep into our consciousness and subconsciousness, resonating within.\n\nIn some ways, yoga nidra is similar to a hypnotic state, but it's not quite the same thing.2 A 2022 study that examined participants' brain waves during yoga nidra sessions found that some parts of the brain were asleep, while other parts of the brain were awake.3\n\n**What Does Yoga Nidra Do?**\n\nResearch shows us that yoga nidra offers several mental, physical, and emotional benefits:\n\n*   Improves mood4\n*   Boosts confidence5\n*   Increases resilience6\n*   Reduces stress levels4\n*   Boosts concentration7\n*   Improves cognitive processing8\n*   Increases alertness5\n*   Boosts memory7\n*   Enhances self-awareness5\n*   Reduces anxiety9\n*   Reduces depression4\n*   Reduces PTSD7\n*   Improves anger management5\n*   Increases motivation5\n*   Reduces insomnia10\n*   Improves sleep quality 10\n*   Reduces pain1\n*   Relieves headaches1\n*   Regulates heart rate1\n*   Lowers blood pressure11\n*   Improves blood sugar levels1\n*   Corrects hormonal imbalances1\n\nYoga nidra promotes emotional healing and helps us become more in tune with our mind, body, and environment. Practicing it regularly is believed to help create a stronger mind-body connection. - SHELBY HARRIS, PSYD\n\nA 2023 review notes that yoga nidra shows potential as a noninvasive, cost-effective, and easily accessible approach to help treat many health conditions, as a complementary form of treatment along with primary treatment.12\n\n**Getting Started with Yoga Nidra**\n\nYou can do yoga nidra at home, using a guided meditation recording. Or, you can do it in a yoga studio, with a teacher who will guide you through the steps. Either way, these tips can help you get started with it:\n\n*   Wear something comfortable: The aim of yoga nidra is to help you get as relaxed as possible. Wear something loose that you're comfortable in.\n*   Avoid tight or restrictive clothing\n*   Find a quiet spot: Choose a warm, quiet, and comfortable spot where you won't be disturbed.\n*   Minimize disruptions: Power down your devices, leave them in another room, or silence your notifications, so they don't disturb you.\n*   Keep your props handy: Keep a cushion, bolster, or blanket on hand, in case you need them to get comfortable.\n*   Create a peaceful environment: If you're doing it at home, you can set the mood by lighting an aromatherapy candle, dimming the lights, and playing soft, serene music to create a peaceful environment.\n*   Use the bathroom: It can be helpful to use the bathroom before you get started, so you can enjoy an uninterrupted session without needing to take breaks.\n\n**Step-by-Step Guide to Yoga Nidra Practice**\n\nIf", "category": "general"},

We may receive compensation when you click on links to those products or services. Please note that this does not affect our editorial independence.\n\n**Choosing How Often You Meditate**\n\nDr. Monique Gary, DO, medical director of the cancer program at Grand View Health, is an oncologist who used meditation as a tool to help support her patients through their treatments. She says that she recommends people focus on a regular meditation practice so that they can feel the benefits.\n\n1. I think in order for it to be a sustainable practice, and one where you can sort of reap the benefit overall as opposed to the transactional benefit of feeling more peaceful, you really need to try to do it three to five times a week, at least.\n\nGary also founded a holistic retreat called Still Rise Farms. In doing this work, Gary uses a number of practices that include meditation. She says that finding a meditation practice that will work for you-whether that's a guided meditation, a mantra meditation, or another form-requires a certain willingness to let go of your preconceived notions.\n\n2. You have to give yourself some grace and be able to laugh at yourself to try some things that maybe don't work so well.\n\nFor her, that low stakes failure came in the form of a very popular meditation app, which she says heightened her anxiety rather than lowering it. When she's answering questions about meditation from her patients, her advice is to customize it to fit you and your situation.\n\n3. If you personalize it then I think that that helps you and makes sure that your needs are addressed,\n\n4. And you feel like an active participant in it, as opposed to a passive person who's being talked at.\n\nIn other words, more isn't always better, different isn't always better, what works for you is what is best.\n\n**What Are Your Goals?**\n\nDr. Tom Ingegno, DAMC has meditated daily for decades, and uses it as part of his professional life as an acupuncturist. If somebody's coming in and maybe they've had a rough week of work, or they got some bad health news, or, [the] loss of a loved one or something like that-we can't take that away,\n\n5. but while they're in the treatment, we try and create that space.\n\nHaving them do some breath work or guided meditation, even, can help.\n\nAs for how often Ingegno meditates. he says that he does so daily and that a digital tool known as a Muse headband helps him sustain it.\n\n6. I'm now over five years of daily meditation and I don't want that number to go to zero...I just don't want to lose that number.\n\n7. So, I will meditate. Even if it's going to be a crap meditation, even if it's only going to be for like two minutes.\n\n8. I'm making sure I do that every morning.\n\nThe length of time you're supposed to meditate at any one time in order to feel those benefits is also a point of contention. Previous research has found that between 5 and 45 minutes is often the best window and that meditating just before bed can help for those looking to reduce insomnia. In order to reach those goals, Ingegno isn't alone in using technology.\n\n**How to Find the Best Meditation Practice for You**\n\nAsk three experts in their respective fields about meditation, and how they do it, and you will get three different answers. For Dr. Gary, what her best practice looks like depends on the time of day and her workload, but her weekends provide the most space for meditation.\n\n9. It's a completely oversized bean bag chair that I like to sit on.\n\n10. And I'll sit right in the center of it and I'll really just focus on my breathing.\n\n11. And I start by remembering to take deep breaths because I find that even during the day, during the week, I don't breathe enough.\n\nDepending on what's at the front of your mind, the way you meditate can change. If you're working on a big project, a guided visualization might help, whereas as a breathing routine may be more helpful if you're struggling with anxiety.\n\n12. [People] tend to think that you've got to find just the perfect pose, and the perfect mantra, and you've got to do your ohms and all these things.\n\n13. And that isn't necessarily the case to see the benefit.\n\nAs someone working in what is historically a form of Eastern medicine, a tradition that is often discredited by Western medical practitioners, Dr. Ingegno says that the influx of interest in tools like meditation shows that healthcare can be democratized when people find a practice that works for them.\n\n14. But only if resources, like those available on YouTube and other free platforms, aren't drowned out by big money biohacker types.\n\nAnd, just like with any health practice, the way you enter into something like a meditation practice can differ radically between people. Maybe it has been recommended by a therapist, for example, or maybe you are just looking for something new to help you deal with daily stressors.\n\n15. It's one of the most accessible and flexible self-help methods out there.\n\n**Keep in Mind**\n\nThe most important thing is finding a meditation practice that works for you, but experts agree that once a day is probably an ideal target to consistently feel the impacts of the practice. However, more important than that is finding a routine that you can do consistently, and that is accessible to you.\n\n16. That may mean just a few times a week, only when you need it, or even more than once a day.\n\nThe great thing about meditation is that it's very easy for you to control where, when, and how often you do it. \n\nRead More: LIVING WELL MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION 2 Sources By John Loeppky John Loeppky is a freelance journalist based in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, who has written about disability and health for outlets of all kinds.

For example, in Chinese medicine, the term Qi-pronounced chee -is defined as the vital energy that fills the universe. Ancient philosopher Ge Hong said, People reside within qi, and qi resides within people. From heaven and earth down to the ten thousand things, each one requires qi to live. This belief and study of the earth's natural energies could also be found in Europe in the 19th century. In 1891 Louis Kuhne published The New Science of Healing. Then, Adolf Just wrote Return to Nature in 1896, which encouraged people to begin walking barefoot outdoors. A few decades later, George Starr White, an American medical doctor, began investigating the use of sleeping while grounded-connected to copper wires affixed to home pipes-to improve the quality of sleep. Modern scientists continue to advocate for Earth's electrons' ability to balance our body's electrical current.\n\n**Should I Practice Earthing?**\n\nYou may want to try earthing if:\n\n1. You experience anxiety or depression\n2. You have chronic fatigue\n3. You are dealing with cardiovascular disease\n4. You have post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic memories\n5. You struggle with pain and inflammation\n\n**Types of Earthing**\n\nEarthing techniques focus on reconnecting your energy with the earth through direct or indirect contact. These methods include:\n\n*   Walking outside barefoot\n*   Laying on the ground\n*   Going swimming or taking a bath\n*   Gardening\n*   Using grounding mats, blankets, patches, and socks\n\n**How to Practice Earthing**\n\nThere are many ways to reconnect with the earth in your daily life and hopefully restore your body's natural defense system. Here are ways you can practice earthing:\n\n1.  Take a walk: Find ways to connect your bare feet with the ground by walking on grass, across the sand or the mud.\n2.  Play in the dirt: Dig into the earth and get the soil between your fingers.\n3.  Ground yourself indoors: When going outside is not an option, grounding mats come in handy by replacing the direct connection you'd get being barefoot outside.\n\n**Benefits of Earthing**\n\nNew treatments will emerge as modern scientists continue tapping into ancient holistic practices. Research shows a promising connection between earthing and measurable improvements in these health issues:\n\n1.  May Improve Chronic Fatigue and Sleep Disorders\n2.  May Boost Immunity\n3.  May Improve Heart Health\n\n**Tips for Earthing**\n\nEarthing, like other forms of treatments, isn't a quick fix. It requires patience and perseverance; however, the benefits are encouraging. Here are some tips once you decide to add earthing as part of your healing journey:\n\n1.  Speak to a professional\n2.  Stick to a routine\n3.  Pay attention\n\n**More Studies About Earthing Need to Be Done**\n\nLike with all therapy, chronic illnesses have underlying medical issues that need to be addressed by your doctor. Modern research shows promising benefits of earthing, but it will take time to determine if these earth-derived electrons work as hard as scientists hope. Earthing studies are under-researched and usually have fewer research subjects-sometimes 50 or fewer people. Also, scientists like Ga√©tan Chevalier, director of the Earthing Institute, have done studies that have not been consistently replicated. The lack of mainstream support and funding can slow down progress.  Read More: LIVING WELL MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION \n\n**Sources**\n\n1.  By Odochi Ibe\n2.  Meet Our Review Board\n3.

Earthing is a free and relatively quick way to positively impact your physical and mental health. Whether you choose to practice it outdoors or indoors, this technique restores the connection between the body and the electrical currents of the earth.\n\nIncorporating earthing into your daily routine may help alleviate chronic fatigue, anxiety, depression, cardiovascular disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic memories, pain, and inflammation. With patience and perseverance, you can begin seeing improvements in your overall well-being.\n\nWhile more studies are needed to fully understand the benefits of earthing, the available research suggests a promising connection between this practice and measurable improvements in various health issues.

{"title": "What Is a Sound Bath?", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-sound-baths-4783501", "content": "**What Is a Sound Bath?**\n\nA sound bath, also known as a sound healing session or sound meditation, is an experiential practice where participants lie down in a quiet space while being enveloped by calming sounds produced by various instruments such as gongs, singing bowls, percussion, chimes, rattles, tuning forks, and the human voice. The intention of a sound bath is to create a state of harmony within the listener by using sound waves to clear discordance from their energy fields.\n\n**What Happens During a Sound Bath?**\n\nDuring a typical sound bath session, participants lie on their backs in the Savasana position for the duration of the experience. The sound healing practitioner facilitates the session and may involve the group in chants, mantras, or rolling oms. Guided experiences can last anywhere from 15 to 60 minutes, after which participants are advised to move slowly when transitioning to a seated position.\n\n**Benefits**\n\nThe benefits of a sound bath include relaxation, an increased sense of well-being, expanded awareness, and access to inner visionary experience. Some healing sound practitioners argue that sound baths can potentially foster physical healing by clearing energy blockages in the body. Research has shown that music and sound therapy have therapeutic effects on both physical and emotional health.\n\n**Who Shouldn't Do a Sound Bath**\n\nWhile generally accessible to anyone interested in experiencing one, there are some counter-indicators for participating in a sound bath. These include individuals who have had recent concussions or traumatic events. However, experts suggest that sound baths can be particularly beneficial for people with anxiety, depression, or stress.\n\n**How to Experience a Sound Bath**\n\nSound baths exist in various locations across the country and can also be experienced at home through guided recordings or apps. Yoga and meditation studios often host these events regularly. A 1:1 sound bath experience is also highly recommended, especially if you have specific injuries or concerns that you want to target.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\nA sound bath is a unique experience that combines music with mindfulness to create a state of harmony within the listener. With its potential benefits for relaxation and physical healing, it's an excellent supplement to any wellness program. Whether experienced in-person or at home, sound baths can be a powerful tool for reducing stress and promoting overall well-being. 2 Source   <https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-urban-wellness-show/202304/what-is-sound-bath-the-healing-power-sound>   <https://www.saffronandsage.com/>   <https://www.naturopathica.com/>    <https://www.cristalysoundbath.com/>    <https://www.soundhealingapp.com/>    <https://www.livingwellmagazine.com/health-and-wellness/music-relaxation-a-healthy-stress-management-tool>   <https://www.crispthoughts.org/post/the-benefits-of-meditation-for-stress-management>   <https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/2019235/>   <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.841444/full>    <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8761914/>   <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7341233/>   <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470326/>   <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551564/>    <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23693-1>   <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34885545/>   <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35423413/>   <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1041447/full>   <https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2022/2019246/>    <https://www.crispthoughts.org/post/music-therapy-for-trauma>   <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.623113/full>   <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8661434/>   <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35614539/>    <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-35323-5>   <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37065449/>   <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1141154/full>   <https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2022/2019247/>    <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37455555/>   <https://www.crispthoughts.org/post/music-therapy-for-stress>   <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.623114/full>   <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36214540/>    <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-35323-5>   <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37065449/>   <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1141154/full>   <https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2022/2019247/>    <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37455555/>   <https://www.crispthoughts.org/post/music-therapy-for-stress>   <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.623114/full>   <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36214540/>    <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-35323-5>   <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37065449/>   <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1141154/full>   <https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2022/2019247/>    <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37455555/>   <https://www.crispthoughts.org/post/music-therapy-for-stress>   <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.623114/full>   <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36214540/>    <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-35323-5>   <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37065449/>   <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1141154/full>   <https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2022/2019247/>    <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37455555/>   <https://www.crispthoughts.org/post/music-therapy-for-stress>   <https://www.frontiersin.org", "category": "general"},

This is chunk 1/1 of an article titled 'How to Become More Mindful in Your Everyday Life'.\n\n**Title**\n\nHow Stress Impacts Your Health Guide How to Become More Mindful in Your Everyday Life\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe practice of mindfulness-directing all of your attention and awareness to the present-can bring many benefits to your relationships and emotional and physical health. For example, practicing everyday mindfulness can:\n\n1.  Pull you out of the negative downward spiral caused by too much daily stress, too many bad moods, or the habit of rumination.\n2.  Help you make fewer errors when processing your experiences.\n3.  Help you put stressful events into perspective and build resilience so you're less overwhelmed by them in the future.\n\n**Benefits of Mindfulness**\n\nThe practice of mindfulness can help you live a more mindful life that allows you to become more conscious of everything you're doing. Many things compete for your attention, and the pressure to multitask can be stifling. Becoming intentionally mindful in your everyday life can help you live with greater purpose and more happiness in today's fast-paced world.\n\n**Mindfulness Exercises**\n\nYou can practice many mindfulness exercises regularly, but learning to be present in the moment is a way of life. Some examples include:\n\n*   Paying keen attention to how you fuel your body by eating slowly and savoring each bite.\n*   Being present with others when communicating and relating, without judgment or distraction.\n*   Focusing on the present moment while engaging in daily activities, such as walking, gardening, or cleaning the house.\n\n**Making Mindfulness a Habit**\n\nTo make mindfulness a habit, you can:\n\n1.  Schedule time each day to practice meditation or yoga.\n2.  Focus on your breathing when you're upset or anxious.\n3.  Practice progressive muscle relaxation by tensing and relaxing your muscles one group at a time.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMindfulness takes practice and effort, but with patience and persistence, it can lead to numerous benefits, including decreased stress, better mental health, better relationships, and greater overall happiness. By incorporating mindfulness into your daily life, you can cultivate a more mindful approach to living and enjoy the many rewards that come with it. Mindful Moment Need a breather?

Daniel B. Block, MD, is a psychiatrist who specializes in treating mood disorders, anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and eating disorders. He received his medical degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine and completed his psychiatric residency at Duke University Medical Center.

Please consult a qualified healthcare professional with any questions you may have regarding your specific condition. If you are experiencing symptoms or need mental health support, please contact a trusted healthcare provider or crisis hotline.\n\n**Bipolar Disorder**\n \n**Overview**\n\nBipolar disorder is a mental health condition defined by periods (or episodes) of extreme mood disturbances that affect mood, thoughts, and behavior. There are two main types of bipolar disorders: Bipolar I disorder involves episodes of severe mania and often depression, while Bipolar II disorder involves a less severe form of mania called hypomania.\n\n*   Around 4.4% of U.S. adults will have bipolar disorder at some point in their lives.\n*   Genetics are thought to play a significant role, although brain abnormalities and environmental factors also contribute as causes of bipolar disorder.\n*   Mood stabilizers are usually the first-line treatment, but electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be used to address severe symptoms.\n\n**Living with Bipolar Disorder**\n\n*   People who have cyclothymic disorder may have a higher risk for later developing bipolar disorder.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\n1.  Only a doctor or qualified mental health professional can diagnose you with bipolar disorder.\n2.  You may want to see your doctor if you are experiencing symptoms of mania, depression, or both.\n3.  Symptoms of mania can include talking excessively, racing thoughts, decreased sleep, and delusions.\n4.  Symptoms of depression may include fatigue, prolonged sadness, and loss of interest in activities.\n\n**Treatment**\n\n*   Bipolar disorder is typically treated with medications and sometimes electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), therapy, and psychoeducation.\n*   Common medications include mood stabilizers or anticonvulsants, as well as second or third generation antipsychotics.\n*   Antidepressants are typically avoided if possible due to risks including mania and rapid cycling.\n\n**Understanding Bipolar Disorder**\n\n*   There is a strong genetic component in bipolar disorder.\n*   Twin studies have found that when one identical twin has the condition, the likelihood that their twin sibling will also have it is around 40%.\n*   While there is a genetic vulnerability, inherited factors interact with environmental influences that can play a role in triggering the disorder's onset.\n\n**Key Terms**\n\n1.  Bipolar I Disorder: This type of bipolar disorder involves the presence of at least one manic episode.\n2.  Bipolar II Disorder: This type of bipolar disorder is marked by periods of depressive and hypomanic episodes without periods of full-blown mania.\n3.

{"title": "Use Guided Imagery For Relaxation", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/use-guided-imagery-for-relaxation-3144606", "content": "with Us How to Use Progressive Muscle Relaxation\n \n**Title**\nUse Guided Imagery For Relaxation\n\n**Overview**\nGuided imagery is a mind-body intervention that involves evoking positive mental imagery to help invoke a positive effect. This relaxation technique can be helpful for calming the body, relieving stress, and combatting feelings of anxiety.\n\n*   It can quickly calm your body and simultaneously relax your mind.\n*   It's pleasant to practice and not overly difficult or intimidating to learn.\n*   It can help you de-stress in minutes and can also be a useful strategy for maintaining resilience toward stress during difficult times.\n\n**How to Practice Guided Imagery**\n\n1.  Get Comfortable\n2.  Breathe From Your Belly\n3.  Vividly Imagine Your Scene\n\n    *   Once you are in a relaxed state, begin to envision yourself in the most relaxing environment you can imagine.\n    *   The key is to find what works for you.\n    *   For some, this would be floating in the cool, clear waters of a remote tropical island, where attractive people bring drinks and smooth music plays in the background.\n    *   For others, this might be sitting by a fire in a snow cabin, deep in the woods, sipping hot cocoa, and reading the latest bestseller.\n\n**Where to Learn Guided Imagery**\n\n*   Taking a class where you are guided by an instructor\n*   Using audio recordings, creating your own recordings\n*   Using your inner voice and imagination\n\n**The Effects of Guided Imagery**\n\nResearch suggests that guided imagery can increase alpha brain waves, which are associated with a relaxed, enhanced mood. When stressed, alpha waves tend to decrease, which is connected to a heightened state of alertness and anxiety.\n\n**How It Works**\n\n1.  Envisioning a relaxing scene in great detail relating to all of the senses.\n2.  The scene envisioned in guided imagery can be something in the natural world, like a beautiful waterfall in Hawaii or a cool and dense forest where you may take a calming walk in your imagination.\n3.  Imagining a wise 'guide' with them, answering their questions and asking them questions to ponder.\n\n**The Benefits of Guided Imagery**\n\n*   Relaxation\n*   Insight\n*   Wisdom\n*   Relieving physical tension and psychological stress at the same time\n\n**Potential Pitfalls and Limitations**\n\n1.  Mastering autonomous guided imagery can take some practice.\n2.  Working with a professional therapist to get to that point can be somewhat costly but worthwhile.\n3.  Some people are unable to visualize things in their mind, this is known as aphantasia.\n\n**How Guided Imagery Compares to Other Techniques**\n\n*   It's an excellent stress management option.\n*   It can be easier than exercise or yoga for those with physical limitations.\n*   It has no risk of side effects like some medical and herbal therapies.\n\n**Tips for Practicing Guided Imagery**\n\n1.  Use ambient sounds that compliment your imagery.\n2.  Set an alarm, just in case you lose track of time or fall asleep.\n3.  Communicate with your subconscious mind with the help of a self-recorded or purchased tape or with the help of a therapist.\n\n**Conclusion**\nGuided imagery is a quick and effective way to deal with stress. However, other relaxation techniques, such as yoga, meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation, may also be helpful. If stress interferes with your ability to function normally, talk to your doctor or a licensed mental health professional. They can recommend strategies and treatments, including therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes.

By Julia Childs Heyl, MSW Published on May 28, 2025 Svetlana Repnitskaya Getty Images\n\n**Title**\nI'm a Therapist and I Tried the Viral 17-Second Manifestation Technique-Here's How It Went\n\n**Overview**\nCan you change your life in just 17 seconds? By Julia Childs Heyl, MSW\n\n*   Published on May 28, 2025\n*   Svetlana Repnitskaya Getty Images\n\n**What Is the 17-Second Manifestation Method?**\nThe newest trend in manifestation is the 17-second manifestation method. This TikTok-approved approach to manifesting touts that any and all dreams can be attained with just 17 seconds a day.\n\n**Trying the 17-Second Manifestation Method**\nI'm not a manifestation novice. Though I don't necessarily think about it as manifestation per se, I am a firm believer in getting clear on your desires, visualizing what they would look like, and then taking action to make them happen.\n\n1.  **Choose a Specific Desire or Goal to Manifest**\n    *   Mine was a specific desire - I wanted to make up my mind regarding a decision that would inevitably change my family's life.\n2.  **Attach a Positive Affirmation**\n    *   The positive affirmation came rather naturally. I can trust my gut became my go-to mantra.\n3.  **Focus on the Thought for 17 Seconds**\n    *   During the morning, I specifically focused on the thought for 17 seconds. However, my mind returned to it plenty of times throughout the day.\n4.  **Release the Thought and Maintain Alignment**\n    *   Releasing the thought and maintaining alignment was a bit tricky.\n\n**Does It Work?**\nMy experience may sound all good and well, but you may be stuck on a very real question: does any of this actually work?\n\n*   I turned to licensed marriage and family therapist Kim Slipski for insight.\n*   Research backs up the sentiment that simply thinking something into fruition isn't likely and can result in unnecessary risky behavior with negative consequences.\n\n**Should You Try It?**\nIt depends on how you want to approach it. While many choose to focus their manifestation on a concrete goal, like buying a house, I chose to focus on something a bit more introspective. This was a move Slipski approved.\n\n*   Explaining that many manifestation schools of thought focus on attaining material things with their goals, she feels this can ultimately be a disservice.\n*   Noting that often the pursuit of material gains is connected to feelings of inadequacy or financial insecurity, simply visualizing a desire won't automatically change your feelings.\n\n**Conclusion**\nIt can't hurt. At the bare minimum, positive thoughts can help decrease symptoms of anxiety. But, be realistic, stay consistent, and remember that your goals and desires are worthy of hard work. Don't bypass the wisdom looking for a fast solution within just 17 seconds a day. Can You Create the Life You Want Through Manifestation Meditation?

Be conscious of the activity.\n2.  Follow a single bite from start to finish, Dr. Naidoo recommends, and pay attention to the sounds of cutting the food, the smell as it wafts up to your nostrils, the texture of the food as it reaches your mouth, the flavors that change as you chew, and the feeling as you swallow your food.\n3.  Recognize your body's signals.\n4.  Slow down your eating so your body and brain can communicate.\n5.  Socialize over food.\n6.  Focus on the sensory details.\n7.  Practice mindfulness throughout your day.\n\n**Mindful Eating Is Not a Diet**\n\nThe purpose of mindful eating isn't to lose weight or cut back on calories; the purpose is to improve your relationship with food and overall eating experience.\n\n*   Dieting or restricting, in any form, doesn't work, says RanDee Anshutz, registered dietitian nutritionist.\n*   Knowing the negative impact of certain foods on your body doesn't mean you have to remove those foods from your diet. \n\n**Keep in Mind**\n\nThe practice of mindfulness has helped thousands of people live more intentionally and develop the skills necessary to manage chronic pain, disease, depression, sleeping problems, and anxiety.\n\n*   When you cook your next meal or pick up takeout, pay attention to the food and how it tastes and feels.\n*   You don't have to necessarily sit at a kitchen table and eat over an extended period of time; you just have to be willing to focus on the experience as it unfolds.

Basic meditation techniques\n2.  Types\n3.  5 meditation techniques you can try\n4.  Benefits\n5.  How to get started\n\n### Overview\n-------------\n\nBy Elizabeth Scott, PhD Updated on January 15, 2024 Reviewed by Sara Clark\n\nMeditation is widely recommended as a health-boosting practice-and for good reason. It provides many positive benefits, from reducing symptoms of stress to relieving physical complaints like headaches and even enhancing immunity to illness.\n\n### Basic Meditation Techniques\n-------------------------------\n\nThough it can be practiced in different ways, a few common threads run through virtually all meditation techniques:\n\n*   **Focused Mind**: A common misconception is that meditation causes the mind to become 'quiet' or 'clear.' In reality, your mind is always thinking. Although your thoughts might not be as rapid, it is perfectly normal for your mind to be active when meditating.\n*   **Being in the Now**: Rather than focusing on the past or future, all meditative practices involve focusing on the present.\n*   **Altered State of Consciousness**: With time, maintaining a quiet mind and focusing on the present can lead to an altered level of consciousness that isn't a sleeping state but isn't quite your average wakeful state either.\n\n### Types\n---------\n\nResearchers generally classify meditation techniques into two different categories:\n\n1.  Concentrative: Involves focusing on a particular object that's generally outside of oneself, such as a candle's flame, the sound of an instrument, or a mantra.\n2.  Non-concentrative: Can include a broader focus, such as the sounds in your environment, internal body states, and even your own breathing.\n\n### 5 Meditation Techniques You Can Try\n-----------------------------------------\n\nHere are five meditation techniques that are great for beginners (and experienced meditators, too!):\n\n1.  **Basic Meditation**: Involves sitting in a comfortable position and using the breath as a point of focus.\n2.  **Focused Meditation**: Focuses on something with intention without engaging your thoughts on it.\n3.  **Activity-Oriented Meditation**: Combines meditation with activities you may already enjoy, or with new activities that help you focus on the present.\n4.  **Mindfulness Meditation**: Involves staying in the present moment rather than thinking about the future or the past.\n5.  **Spiritual Meditation**: Can be a spiritual practice where you meditate on a singular question until an answer comes, or meditate to clear your mind and accept whatever comes that day.\n\n### Benefits\n------------\n\nMeditation has been shown to have a wide variety of mental and physical health benefits:\n\n*   Boosts mood\n*   Improves sleep\n*   Lowers stress\n*   Decreases blood pressure\n*   Improves empathy\n*   Reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression\n\n### How to Get Started\n------------------------\n\nIf you are ready to begin trying out some meditation techniques, here are some helpful tips to get started:\n\n1.  **Set Aside a Time**: Choose when you want to meditate each day.\n2.  **Find a Space**: Choose a relaxing space where you're free of distractions.\n3.  **Get Comfortable**: Sit in a comfortable position where you can sit up straight with both feet resting on the floor.\n4.  **Focus on Your Breath**: Close your eyes and focus on your breath.\n\nThe best meditation technique is one you can stick to. Consistent practice-even just quieting the mind for five minutes a day-is more valuable than sessions that are longer but infrequent. The most effective meditation technique may be particularly helpful, such as mindfulness meditation, which has been shown to be useful for anxiety disorders and depression.\n\n**References**\n--------------\n\n1.  \"Mindfulness Meditation.\" National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), nih.gov.\n2.  \"Focused Attention.\" Mindful.org, mindfulness.org.\n3.  \"What Is Meditation?\" Mindful.org, mindfulness.org.\n4.  \"The Benefits of Meditation.\" Harvard Health Publishing, health.harvard.edu.\n5.  \"Meditation and Mental Health.\" National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), nih.gov.\n6.  \"Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction: A Systematic Review of the Literature.\" Journal of Clinical Psychology, jop.sagepub.com.

{"title": "Understanding Emotions", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/emotions-4157165", "content": "Mental Health Anxiety Depression Bipolar Disorder Trauma and PTSD Caregiving 6 Signs You Should Consider Calling Off the Wedding, According to a Relationship Coach LIVING WELL Understanding Emotions While we are all wired differently, our emotions-and the ways in which we feel and respond to the world around us-make us unique. They allow us to realize what's most important to us, from the people we care about to the opinions we hold, and force us to navigate the complexities of everyday life. They may also give us a glimpse into patterns stemming from our childhood experiences. Learn where emotions originate, how they affect our lives and behaviors, and why they manifest in the ways that they do.\n\n**The 6 Types of Basic Emotions and Their Effect on Human Behavior**\n\nEmotions are essential for human survival and functioning. They help us navigate our environment, form relationships, and make decisions that impact our well-being.\n\n1. Happiness is a positive emotion associated with feelings of joy, contentment, and satisfaction.\n2. Sadness is a negative emotion characterized by feelings of sorrow, grief, and loss.\n3. Fear is an anxiety-driven emotion related to threats or dangers, prompting us to take action for self-protection.\n4. Disgust is a complex emotion involving a strong aversion to certain objects, people, or situations.\n5. Anger is a negative emotion characterized by feelings of hostility, frustration, and resentment.\n6.

Cancel reply Share your thoughts on this article by filling out the form below. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Name Email Comment Submit Your Response\n\n**What Is Body Scan Meditation?**\n\nBody scan meditation (BSM) involves paying attention to parts of the body and bodily sensations in a gradual sequence from feet to head.\n\n**Benefits of Body Scan Meditation**\n\n*   Reduced stress is one important benefit of body scanning, which can have physical benefits such as reduced inflammation, fatigue, and insomnia.\n*   Research suggests that having a regular meditation practice can have other benefits, such as lower blood pressure, less pain, better sleep, reduced anxiety and stress, and better emotional regulation.3\n*   The body scan meditation is a very useful and effective meditation that can help you return to and maintain a relaxed state when you become too tense.\n\n**How to Do a Body Scan Meditation**\n\n1.  Get comfortable, lying down or sitting comfortably.\n2.  Take a few deep breaths, letting your breathing slow down and start breathing from your belly instead of from your chest.\n3.  Bring awareness to your feet, observing sensations in your feet and acknowledging any thoughts or emotions that accompany them.\n4.  Breathe into the tension if you notice any uncomfortable sensations, focusing on them and visualizing the tension leaving your body through your breath and evaporating into the air.\n5.  Continue this practice with each area of your body, gradually moving up through your feet until you reach the top of your head.\n\n**How Can Body Scan Meditation Reduce Stress**\n\nBody scan meditation helps rebuild the connection between our minds and bodies by forcing us to be present in the moment and assess what we are experiencing so we can relax and ease the stress before it takes a serious toll on our well-being.\n\n**Tips for Practicing Body Scan Meditation**\n\n*   Do it often: Practice body scan meditation anytime you feel stressed or several times throughout the day as a regular practice.\n*   Try a brief body scan: If you don't have much time, do an abbreviated version of this body scan meditation by just sitting and noticing any place in your body where you're carrying tension rather than moving from part to part.\n*   Incorporate other relaxation techniques: You can also try progressive muscle relaxation, breathing exercises, or visualization exercises for releasing stress and tension in your body.", "category": "general"},

Umhau, MD, MPH, CPE on July 23, 2024. \n**Addiction**\n\nAddiction is a disorder characterized by the compulsive use of a substance or activity that triggers our reward systems despite experiencing adverse consequences.\n\nA person's genes and environment influence this complex condition. Addiction is widely viewed as a brain disease due to how it impacts the **brain's reward, pleasure, and self-control circuits**. In the past, addiction was thought to only encompass substance abuse, but the definition has been expanded to include activities like gambling as well as gaming, shopping, and exercise.\n\nIt's also important to note that addiction is about the underlying neurology of the brain and not about the outward behaviors. With appropriate treatment, people with addictions can go on to live happy, healthy lives.\n\n**Understanding Addiction**\n\n*   Can Tapering Off Alcohol Prevent Withdrawal?\n*   What Does It Mean to Be Sober Curious?\n*   Can Self-Improvement Feel Like Too Much of a Good Thing?\n\n**The Symptoms Used to Diagnose Substance Use Disorders**\n\n1.  The inability to control the use of the substance\n2.  Continued use despite adverse consequences\n3.  Withdrawal symptoms when trying to stop using the substance\n4.  Tolerance, needing more of the substance to feel the same effects\n5.  Neglecting important activities or relationships due to the substance use\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n1.  Is addiction a disease?\n    *   Yes, addiction is a treatable, chronic disease that affects the brain's reward, motivation, memory, and related circuitry.\n2.  What causes addiction?\n    *   People engage in potentially addictive activities to feel pleasure, and over time, the reinforcing effect of these activities may change brain chemistry to create an unconscious drive to continue the behavior.\n\n**Breaking an Addiction**\n\nThe first step in overcoming addiction is to desire change and avoid the people, places, and things which promote the addiction. Support groups, mentors, and 12-step programs provide help, while counselors, recovery centers, and physicians provide expertise and medication to treat cravings and the effects of withdrawal. Eating healthy and getting exercise also play an important role in recovery.\n\n**Is Addiction Genetic?**\n\nA person's genetics account for about half of their risk for developing an addiction. The impact of genetics is influenced by an interaction between a person's environment, diet, and biology. Alcoholism, like other addictions, tends to run in families, and members of those families are at increased risk for developing alcoholism.\n\n**Key Terms**\n\n*   Substance Use Disorder: A psychiatric condition that involves the compulsion to use a drug or alcohol despite the development of adverse consequences.\n*   Behavioral Addiction: A pleasurable activity changes the brain and drives a person to engage compulsively in the activity despite harmful consequences.\n*   Intervention: An organized attempt by family members or friends to confront a loved one about how their addictive behavior has affected them.\n\n**Comorbidity**\n\nComorbidity refers to the presence of more than one distinct condition in an individual. A common example is when someone with a mental illness also has a substance use disorder. Neither condition causes the other, and successful treatment will often address both conditions at the same time.\n\n**Explore Addiction**\n\n*   Why Emotional Sobriety Is a Critical Part of Your Recovery Journey\n*   What Does It Take to Get Sober?\n*   3 People Share How They Coped\n*   Understanding Enabler Behavior: Motivations, Signs, and Strategies for Change\n*   Redefining Sobriety: The Rise of the California Sober Lifestyle\n*   The 8 Best Online Psychiatry Services That Take Insurance, Tried and Tested\n\n**Conditions A-Z**\n\n*   Neurodivergence\n*   Phobias\n*   Anxiety\n*   Kids' Mental Health\n*   ADHD\n*   Eating Disorders\n*   Bipolar Disorder\n*   BPD\n*   Depression\n*   Neurological Disorders\n*   PTSD\n*   OCD\n*   Panic Disorder\n*   Schizophrenia\n\nPage Sources & References:\n\n1.  https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn1572\nLast edited by John C.

What Is Metta Meditation?\n2. Benefits\n3. Getting Started\n4. Techniques\n5. Challenges\n6. Integrating Metta Meditation Into Daily Life\n\n### What Is Metta Meditation?\n\nMetta meditation, also known as loving-kindness meditation, focuses on cultivating love, compassion, and feelings of well-being for oneself and others.\n\n*   Buddha originally taught this kind of meditation over 2600 years ago.\n*   Buddhists still practice it to this day.\n*   Loving-kindness meditation is the first part of the Four Brahma Vihara meditations that the Buddha taught to promote positive emotions:\n\n    *   Metta (loving-kindness)\n    *   Karuna (compassion)\n    *   Mudita (appreciative joy)\n    *   Uppekha (equanimity)\n\n### Benefits\n\nMetta meditation promotes positive feelings like joy, trust, gratitude, happiness, and compassion-all of which, according to metta meditation practice, you're supposed to feel unconditionally for yourself and others.\n\n*   Promote self-compassion\n*   Decrease anxiety and stress\n*   Be incorporated into cognitive-behavioral therapy to treat depression and social anxiety\n*   Help reduce symptoms of mood disorders\n*   Reduce physical and chronic pain\n*   Enhance social connections\n\n### Getting Started\n\n1.  Sit in a comfortable and relaxed position.\n2.  Take two or three deep breaths to center yourself-feel or imagine your breath moving through your chest, around your heart area.\n3.  Acknowledge any stress or negative feelings you might be holding on to, and try to let them go.\n\n### Techniques\n\n1.  Loving Kindness Toward Yourself\n    *   Choose a mantra of loving kindness to repeat to yourself as you breathe:\n        +   May I feel happy.\n        +   May I be at peace.\n        +   May I be safe.\n2.  Loving Kindness Toward Someone You Love\n    *   Change your mantra to the second person and address your loved one directly:\n        +   May you feel happy.\n        +   May you be at peace.\n        +   May you be safe.\n3.  Loving Kindness Toward Someone Neutral\n    *   Think of someone with whom you have a neutral relationship-perhaps a coworker or a shopkeeper you see often.\n    *   Repeat your mantra with these people in mind:\n        +   May you feel happy.\n        +   May you be at peace.\n        +   May you be safe.\n4.  Loving Kindness Toward a Challenging Relationship\n    *   Imagine someone with whom you have a negative or challenging relationship and address them with your loving-kindness mantra.\n5.  Loving Kindness Toward All Beings\n    *   Change your mantra to include yourself and everyone:\n        +   May we all feel happy.\n        +   May we all be at peace.\n        +   May we all be safe.\n\n### Integrating Metta Meditation Into Daily Life\n\nThe key to metta meditation is consistency and repetition. If you can make time for a sit-down meditation once or a few times a day or a few times a week, that's ideal; however, even if you only meditate occasionally, maybe once a week or even just when you are feeling particularly down on yourself, you can still reap the benefits of loving-kindness meditation.\n\n*   You can also actively practice metta meditation when you find yourself in certain situations, such as when you are having trouble with a coworker or a boss.\n*   Take a moment, when you can, to send compassion to yourself and to them in order to approach what might be a tense and fraught circumstance calmly and empathetically. This sets you up for both compassion for yourself when dealing with a difficult situation and compassion for the other people involved.\n\n### Challenges\n\nSometimes, difficult feelings like sadness, anger, or grief can come up during your metta meditation. That's OK. Try not to judge yourself when this happens. Feeling those feelings means you are getting in touch with your emotions, which is always good. This might sound contradictory but try to be compassionate with yourself for not having compassion with yourself.\n\n*   If you can, treat these feelings with respect-accept them, be patient with them, and show yourself kindness for feeling them.\n*   This is how you move forward in your loving-kindness meditation.\n*   You might find yourself getting stuck in any of the phases of your metta meditation. You might not be able to access kind and loving feelings for certain people just yet. That's OK, too.\n*   The point is to work up to being able to love yourself and others at every stage-work with yourself and be patient with yourself until you can get there with honesty and without judgment.\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n\n1.  How often do I need to practice metta meditation for it to work?\n    *   Consistency is important.\n    *   Aim for once a day or a few times a week.\n    *   And it doesn't need to be a long meditation either-fitting even a few minutes regularly into your schedule can be helpful.\n2.  What if I'm having trouble getting started?\n    *   If you're having trouble jumping right into your metta meditation, that's ok.\n    *   To start, pick a mantra that feels the most accessible to you and begin with focusing just on yourself.\n    *   Practice that mantra until it feels true to you (the old fake it til you make it ), and then you can expand into including others in your metta meditation practice. Acknowledging and forgiving yourself for negative thoughts and feelings is the first step.\n\n### Meet Our Review Board\n\nShare Feedback on This Article\n\nNote: This content has been paraphrased, reformatted, and reorganized to fit a standard article structure.

No matter what your schedule looks like. If you take some time to meditate every day, you'll find that you generally feel less stressed and more focused at work, school, or wherever.\n\nMeditation isn't a complex concept. At its core, it emphasizes the importance of attention and awareness. When you meditate, you're able to focus on your mind and let go of distractions. Meditation lets you take a much-needed break from the noise of the world and your own busy thoughts. This break can make you feel more relaxed and clear-headed as you go about your day.\n\nStudies show that meditation can help reduce stress, improve how well you focus, and make you more aware of your thoughts and feelings. It can also be good for your overall mental and emotional health.1\n\nFinding the Type of Meditation That Works for You\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are different ways to meditate, like focusing on your breath, paying attention to your thoughts, or even moving your body mindfully. Each method can help you find some calmness and clarity.\n\nIf you think that meditation isn't for you, maybe because of some preconceived notion you have of the practice, you may simply not have found the type that works for you. There's no single way to meditate that works for everyone. While a friend might successfully meditate by sitting in silence, listening to a meditation guide might work better for you.\n\nMeditation simply means to focus. Meditation is an umbrella term much like sports. There are many different types of sports, and they all help you get good at different things. There are also many kinds of meditation, and they help you train your brain in different ways, says Dorsey Standish, a mindfulness & brain health expert.\n\nThe goal is to explore different types of meditation and find one that fits your life and makes you feel at peace. So take a few deep breaths and prepare to learn about eight types of meditation, how they are practiced, and what benefits you stand to gain by finding the one for you.\n\n### Mindfulness Meditation\n\nBeing fully present in the moment helps you develop an appreciation for all that life offers, and mindfulness meditation can help you achieve this. It involves paying attention to your thoughts, feelings, and sensations without reproach or judgment. It encourages you to simply observe patterns in these aspects of your life without trying to change them.\n\nThe most common technique in mindfulness meditation is focusing on your breath. You sit in a comfortable position, close your eyes, and pay attention to how your breath moves in and out of your body. You gently bring your focus back to your breath when your mind wanders.\n\nFor Standish, one of her go-to practices for new mindfulness students is a 1-minute method to stop the stress cycle and calm the nervous system. It's called the S.T.O.P. technique. When you notice you're stressed or frantic, S.T.O.P. and take a mindful pause:\n\n*   Stop what you're doing\n*   Take a few deep breaths\n*   Observe your experience (thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations)\n*   Proceed with something that will support you in this moment\n\nOther techniques include body scan meditation, where you pay attention to different body parts and notice any sensations or feelings. You can also practice mindfulness during everyday activities like eating, walking, or even while doing chores by focusing entirely on the task, removing distractions, and paying rapt attention to your senses and emotions.\n\nIf you are living with chronic stress or anxiety, mindfulness meditation can be very beneficial for you. It helps you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings, making you less likely to get caught up in them. Mindfulness meditation is also helpful for improving your focus and concentration. At work, it can boost your productivity and creativity. In your personal life, it can improve your relationships and overall well-being.2\n\nBecause it's easy to practice and requires no special equipment, mindfulness meditation is great for beginners and can be done almost anywhere at any time.\n\n### Spiritual Meditation\n\nIf your spirituality is important to you, spiritual meditation can help you deepen your connection with a higher power you believe in. Even if you don't have religious or spiritual beliefs but are looking for a deeper sense of meaning and purpose in life, you can practice spiritual meditation.\n\nWhile other forms of meditation encourage you to focus on yourself, spiritual meditation wants you to look beyond yourself and connect with something greater.\n\nYou might use silent prayer, chants, or mantras in spiritual meditation. Many people choose a quiet place that feels special or sacred, like a church, temple, or a peaceful spot outdoors. The idea is to focus on your breath or a spiritual phrase and let go of your thoughts to feel a connection with a higher power or the universe.\n\nYou might use candles, incense, or prayer beads to make your practice feel more special or focused.\n\nSpiritual meditation can give you a deep sense of peace and connection to something larger than life. It's great for people who are looking to grow spiritually. This type of meditation can make you feel more compassionate and connected to the people around you. It can also feel comforting when you're stressed or sad because it tends to offer a sense of hope.\n\nPracticing spiritual meditation can help you align your life with your spiritual values or beliefs.\n\n### Focused Meditation\n\nEver find yourself lost in thought for several minutes, staring at one spot for too long? That's a great way to begin focused meditation. This type requires you to concentrate on a single object, sound, or thought. You could even focus on your breath, as with many other meditation styles It trains your mind to focus on one thing and ignore distractions.\n\nIf your mind wanders, don't fuss; gently bring it back to what you've chosen to concentrate on.\n\nTo practice focused meditation, pick something to concentrate on.

If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.\n\nThese services offer convenient, empathetic support for couples of all kinds\n\nBy Hannah Owens, LMSW\nUpdated on May 15, 2025\n\n**Our Top Picks**\n\n*   Regain Online-Therapy.com Talkspace\n*   See More (2)\n*   Growing Self Modern Intimacy\n\n**What to Expect from Online Couples Counseling**\n\n*   How much does it cost?\n*   Counseling services can range from $75 to $450 per session or more. Some companies offer subscriptions for less than $500 per month.\n*   Who is it for? Couples, people in relationships, and individuals who want to work on their relationships independently.\n*   Will insurance cover it? Usually, couples therapy is not covered by insurance, but this also depends on the company and whether one of the people in couples therapy has a mental health diagnosis that is being treated.\n*   How do we meet? Many online couples therapy companies offer weekly sessions via video chat, phone, or text. In many cases, you and your partner can join the session from different devices.\n*   Is it confidential? Be sure to read through any company's privacy policy to better understand whether it is HIPAA-compliant (HIPAA is the law that protects personal health information) and whether it shares any private information with third parties; we recommend opting out of data collection.\n*   What's the time commitment? You and your partner might find that you can work out your issues in a number of weeks, while other couples might need months or even years in therapy. As for how long you'll spend in each session, the companies on this list offer sessions from 30 to 50 minutes each.\n*   Does it work? Couples therapy, even online couples therapy in particular, has been proven effective, but you'll only get out what you put in. If you come to therapy ready to do the work, you're more likely to see success.\n\n**How I Review Online Therapy Services**\n\nI've spent three years testing and surveying real therapy users and reviewing their experiences to help rate and share the best online therapy services. You can see a full breakdown of our online therapy research and testing process on Verywell Mind, but here is an overview of how I capture and evaluate firsthand experience and survey data.\n\n*   Firsthand Experience\n    *   I had 65 different people sign up for talk therapy with all 55 online therapy companies reviewed.\n    *   Over the past three years, I've published 153 reviews (here are our reviews for BetterHelp and Talkspace, for instance).\n    *   I had my testers try out each company's therapy services, and if the company offered other services (like couples therapy and kid or teen therapy) we tested those too.\n    *   I asked each tester to try each service for at least a month, which usually meant between two and six sessions at each company.\n    *   I also asked testers to switch therapists partway through, if possible, in order to get a holistic idea of the offerings and quality of each company.\n    *   My testers were located all across the United States and abroad, meaning I gained extensive information about each company's services in a variety of areas.\n*   User Surveys\n    *   I surveyed more than 8,000 therapy clients who are currently using one of the 55 online therapy companies tested or who had used one in the recent past.\n    *   I collected 350 different data points in which I asked users to evaluate each company's services, from their therapist's qualifications to whether they found a therapist who met all their needs to how they'd rate the company overall.\n\n**How Do You Know If You Need Couples Therapy?**\n\n*   If you are having trouble communicating with your partner, if you find yourselves fighting a lot, or if you are disagreeing about important aspects of your lives, these are all great reasons to try out couples therapy.\n*   Working with a couples therapist can help strengthen your relationship by improving the way you talk to and interact with each other, practicing better ways of solving problems, and really delving into the issues that are repeatedly arising in the relationship.\n\n**Paying for Online Couples Therapy**\n\nSome online therapy companies who provide couples therapy operate as subscriptions-you pay a certain amount monthly for a certain number of sessions in that month. Other companies are pay-per-session. The amount you pay might be fixed, or might differ depending on your location or the qualifications of your therapist. It's important to note that couples therapy is generally not covered by insurance, because it is usually not considered a necessary service. However, if one or both of you have a diagnosed mental health condition, you might be able to use your insurance to pay for your online couples therapy sessions.\n\n**Why Trust Verywell Mind**\n\nHannah Owens is Verywell Mind's Mental Health Editor.

By John Loeppky Updated on August 29, 2024\n\nMedically reviewed by Shaheen Lakhan, MD, PhD, FAAN Verywell Mind Getty Images\n\n**The History of Binaural Beats and How They Work**\n\nBinaural beats were first identified by Heinrich Wilhelm Dove, a meteorologist who primarily focused on weather and climate, in the mid-19th century. More than 100 years later, Dr. Gerald Oster published the first scientific paper on the subject in 1973. They involve what experts like Brian Taylor, AuD, senior director of audiology for Signia and an adjunct professor at the University of Wisconsin call an auditory illusion.\n\nWhen you present one tone to one ear and a second to the other ear, your brain perceives an additional tone, says Taylor. This is the essence of binaural beats, an auditory illusion in which each ear is transmitting one frequency to the central auditory pathway. The thinking and accompanying research argue that different frequencies, measured in hertz, are more applicable to different applications.\n\n**When to Use Binaural Beats**\n\nA lot of the public narratives about binaural beats, including those we see on social media, look to apply the process to particular situations, particularly where some type of re-regulation might be useful. Some common use cases include focusing while studying, reducing anxiety or stress, and improving a person's sleep.\n\n**How to Use Binaural Beats**\n\nBinaural beats have traditionally been split into two broad use cases:\n\n*   As a form of therapy to induce calmness or mindfulness, focus, or sleep\n*   As a so-called digital drug to induce a state of euphoria similar to what can be available via psychoactive drugs\n\n**Are There Benefits for Mental Health?**\n\nWe keep coming back to this hiccup with regards to effectiveness. Researchers in a 2023 systematic review wrote that part of the issue is how different studies have applied various methodologies.\n\n**Are Binaural Beats Safe?**\n\nBinaural beats are generally considered safe. However, those who choose to use them are urged-especially if they have a brain-based disability such as epilepsy-to check in with their primary care physician before use.\n\nYou are also urged, just like when you're listening to your favorite pop-punk band, not to listen too loudly and to stop listening if doing so is creating the opposite effect. The world is depressing enough, you don't need to add to it with your playlist.\n\n**Where Can I Find Resources on Binaural Beats?**\n\nGiven the mixed bag of results that researchers have discovered when diving deeper into binaural beats, it's important to proceed with caution. There are multiple playlists on YouTube for binaural beats, though mileage may vary. There are also multiple phone apps on your app store of choice that can provide you access to binaural beats.\n\nTaylor says that this proliferation of digital options has helped binaural beats become a bit more mainstream. With the ubiquity of smartphones, apps and earbuds, everyone has access to trying binaural beats...Remember to get the full effects you need to listen with earbuds.\n\nThis has some inherent limitations. That said, maybe worth a try to enhance concentration, reduce stress, fall asleep, or improve creativity. McCarthy says the most common way her clients are finding binaural beats is via social media platforms like TikTok.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nIt seems as if the worst case scenario, if you listen to binaural beats at a reasonable volume level, is that nothing will happen. It's valuable to keep an eye on the ongoing research into this tool's effectiveness-but if it's helping you, great! If audio stimuli helps you regulate, then it may also be worth looking into strategies such as music therapy. Or, you can return to your favorite playlists.\n\nThose never seem to let us down.

When you feel yourself caught in the grip of fear or anxiety, focusing your sensations in the present moment can help you get out of those distressing thoughts and feelings.\n\nGrounding techniques are often used as a way of coping with flashbacks or dissociation when you have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).1 They can also be helpful in other types of anxiety. Because it focuses on being present in the moment, grounding can be considered a variant of mindfulness.\n\n**Grounding Techniques**\n\nTo connect with the here and now, do something (or several things) that will bring all your attention to the present moment. Be sure to keep your eyes open while you're grounding yourself so you're aware of everything that's going on around you. If you notice that you're slipping into a flashback or a dissociative state, try some of these grounding techniques.\n\n*   **Sight**\n    *   Complete a crossword puzzle, sudoku, word search, or other puzzle.\n    *   Count all the pieces of furniture around you.\n    *   Play a distracting game on your tablet, computer, or smartphone.\n    *   Put on your favorite movie or TV show.\n    *   Read a book or magazine.\n    *   Take a mental inventory of everything around you, such as all the colors and patterns you see, the sounds you hear, and the scents you smell. Saying this out loud is helpful too.\n*   **Smell**\n    *   Get some essential oils that remind you of good times (freshly cut grass, rain, clean laundry, or sugar cookies, for example) and smell one.\n    *   Light a scented candle or melt scented wax.\n    *   Sniff strong peppermint, which also has the benefit of having a soothing effect.3Ôªø\n*   **Sound**\n    *   Call a loved one.\n    *   Put on some nature sounds such as birds chirping or waves crashing.\n    *   Read out loud, whether it's a favorite children's book, a blog post, or a novel.\n    *   Talk out loud about what you see and hear, or what you're thinking or doing.4\n    *   Turn up the radio or blast your favorite song.\n*   **Taste**\n    *   Bite into a lemon or lime.\n    *   Let a piece of chocolate melt in your mouth, noticing how it tastes and feels as you roll it around with your tongue.\n    *   Suck on a mint or chew peppermint or cinnamon gum.\n    *   Take a bite of pepper or some hot salsa.\n*   **Touch**\n    *   Cuddle and pet your dog or cat if you have one.\n    *   Drink a hot or cold beverage.\n    *   Grab an article of clothing, a blanket, or a towel and knead it in your hands or hold it to your cheek. Concentrate on what it feels like.\n    *   Hold an ice cube and let it melt in your hand.\n    *   Massage your temples.\n    *   Pop some bubble wrap.\n    *   Put your hands under running water.\n    *   Rub your hand lightly over the carpet or a piece of furniture, noting the texture.\n    *   Take a hot or cool shower.\n\n**Benefits**\n\nThe nice thing about grounding is that many of these can be done in any environment.6 You might be home alone or out in public, but once you feel that flashback or dissociation coming on, you can use grounding to move your focus back to the present.\n\nWorking on grounding takes dedication, but it becomes easier over time. If these particular grounding techniques don't work for you, try something else. For example, some people find that a rubber band on their wrist is useful for snapping them back to the moment. The ultimate goal is to live in the now and focus on the present when the past starts coming up.2\n\n**When to Seek Professional Help**\n\nGround can be a helpful way to manage symptoms of anxiety, dissociation, and flashbacks. If the symptoms you are experiencing are causing distress or interfering with your life, it's important to talk to a mental health professional.\n\nThe specific treatment your doctor or therapist recommends will depend on your diagnosis. PTSD Treatments Your doctor may prescribe medications, including antidepressants or antipsychotics, to help manage your symptoms. Different types of psychotherapy, including cognitive processing therapy, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy, and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) can be helpful.\n\nAnxiety Treatments Anxiety is also typically treated with therapy and medication. Medications that may be prescribed for anxiety include antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and beta blockers. CBT and exposure therapy can be highly effective.7\n\n**Helpful Resources**\n\nIf you aren't getting treatment for your PTSD but would like to, you can find PTSD treatment providers in your area through the Anxiety Disorder Association of America website.\n\nThe International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (ISSTD) also provides a wealth of information on the connection between trauma and dissociation, how to cope with dissociation, and links to therapists who treat trauma and dissociation. How PTSD Is Treated Takeaways Grounding techniques can be extremely helpful for those moments when you feel yourself getting caught up in your own head.\n\nIt can be as simple as paying attention to the world around you or engaging your senses to help distract you from anxious, fearful feelings. This can be particularly helpful if you have a condition such as PTSD or anxiety.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember these techniques aren't a substitute for treatment. If you are struggling with anxiety or symptoms of PTSD, be sure to talk to your doctor to learn more about treatments that can help.\n\n9 Healthy Coping Skills for PTSD Read More: CONDITIONS A-Z PTSD LIVING WITH 7 Sources By Matthew Tull, PhD Matthew Tull, PhD is a professor of psychology at the University of Toledo, specializing in post-traumatic stress disorder.

How We Chose the Winners\n\nFinalists were first nominated by our readers (yes, you all!), members of the Verywell Mind expert review board-which is comprised of over 20 accredited specialists in the fields of psychology, psychiatry and mindfulness-and the Verywell Mind editorial team.\n\nWinners were then voted on by a panel of nine expert judges who used the following criteria to make their choices: quality and accuracy of content and work, mental health credentials and lived experiences, reach, and alignment with Verywell Mind's core values. The final list of winners celebrates people who are actively moving the conversation about mental health forward in a meaningful way-whether it's in their community or for a wider audience.\n\nWithout further ado, meet this year's 25 winners and join us in celebrating their ongoing contributions to the world of mental health.\n\n**Taraji P. Henson**\n\nActress, Co-Founder of Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation, Entrepreneur, Author\n\nA few things come to mind when you think of Taraji P. Henson-award-winning actress, haircare entrepreneur, and author. Now, add a mental health activist to the list. The Empire actor has been working to destigmatize mental health in the Black community since 2018 when she co-founded the Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation (BLHF).\n\nNamed after her father, Boris Lawrence, the foundation aims to help Black folks access cognitive care by offering free therapy sessions and scholarship funds, plus a host of other programs, including this year's fundraiser and mixer, the Can We Talk? Symposium event.\n\nMy foundation has been chipping away at that mistrust by offering culturally relevant, barrier-free services in traditional trusted spaces like barbershops, HBCU campuses, and with providers and practitioners who practice cultural humility. Mental health advocacy is more than a passion project for Henson-her work is directly inspired by her experience growing up with her father, who was a Vietnam war veteran with untreated mental health issues.\n\nThis difficult upbringing moved her to not only create the foundation in her father's name but also speak to Congress about Black youth suicide rates and launch a Facebook Watch series dedicated to having open conversations around Black mental health. It's these many accomplishments that moved us to name Henson as one of this year's Verywell Mind 25.\n\n**Dr. Judith Joseph**\n\nPsychiatrist, Media Consultant, Content Creator\n\nDr. Judith Joseph is a board-certified psychiatrist with expertise in everything from women's health to child and adolescent psychiatry to serious mental illness. Not only that, but she is also an award-winning mental health content creator, with more than one million followers on social media.\n\nShe is on the medical board of the national non-profit Let's Talk Menopause, an organization focused on destigmatizing menopause so that women can get the information they need and the healthcare they deserve (two things this country has consistently failed to provide). Dr. Joseph also runs an unprecedented clinical lab, comprised of 10 female researchers, that studies high-functioning mental health conditions, such as high-functioning depression, bipolar disorder, ADHD, OCD, PTSD, and schizophrenia-the first lab to ever do so.\n\nHer incredibly popular social media posts focus on the mental health topics researched in her lab, and make difficult subjects like trauma approachable and accessible. Dr. Joseph stood out to us for her social media content that makes mental health education easy and fun and for her work taking the misunderstanding and discrimination out of menopause.\n\n**Phil Schermer**\n\nFounder and CEO of Project Healthy Minds\n\nWith a background in both finance and politics, Phil Schermer knows a thing or two about stress. In October 2020, while the entire world struggled through the COVID-19 pandemic, Schermer launched Project Healthy Minds with the goal of attacking a problem that has only increased since then-the high barriers between millions of people and access to necessary mental healthcare.\n\nSchermer's stated mission, then, is to combine technology and industry with a Gen-Z Millennial sensibility to reshape how we access mental health help. His organization created a free mental health marketplace to quickly connect users with the resources they need when they need them most.\n\nFrom wellness exercises to therapy providers and educational resources across the mental health spectrum, Schermer's organization is growing into a mental health force to be reckoned with. Kenneth Cole Fashion Designer, Activist, Founder of The Mental Health Coalition Kenneth Cole Productions Kenneth Cole is known for his iconic shoes and clothing. However, in addition to making people look good, he also advocates for making them feel mentally well.\n\nIn October 2019, Cole announced the formation of The Mental Health Coalition (MHC), which aims to spread awareness about mental health. We're [not] going to continue to make any meaningful progress until we can make it easier to talk about these circumstances. We are appreciative that we have been able to find a voice that helps do it in some way.\n\nIn 2023, Cole collaborated with Sesame Workshop to raise awareness around children's emotional well-being. He designed a collection of T-shirts, hoodies, and sneakers featuring Oscar the Grouch, Cookie Monster, Elmo, and the Count. Each design features a unique message about mental health and the importance of being open and honest about feelings.\n\nHis coalition's most recent initiative, SOS (Safe Online Standards) for Kids' Mental Health, aims to establish safe online standards for kids' mental health for the first time ever. While Cole believes that the mental health crisis in the United States is possibly one of the biggest of our time, he is inspired to keep making a difference through the MHC.

Buddhist philosophy is closely related to meditation because they believe in using mindfulness to break out of the cycle of endless suffering to attain enlightenment.\n\nBuddhism is commonly defined as including Southeast Asian Theravada Buddhism, East Asian Mahayana Buddhism, Indo-Tibetan Mahayana, and Vajrayana Buddhism. To those who practice it, Buddhist meditation is a way of life and works to nurture a healthy relationship with the mind.\n\nBelow are a few of the core principles of Buddhist meditation:\n\n*   **Mindfulness**: Fully inhabit the present moment, recognizing that 'now' is all we truly have.\n*   **Impermanence**: I stress the importance of acknowledging impermanence, which allows us to appreciate each moment without clinging to it. It is futile to hold onto shifting, changing elements in a transient world.\n*   **Compassion**: Foster a loving and kind attitude towards all beings, including ourselves.\n*   **Suffering**: Buddhist meditation recognizes suffering as an inherently universal concept because of our desire for attachment and asserts we can end our suffering by freeing ourselves from the never-ending loop of hypnotic, unhelpful desires that do not serve us.1\n*   **Non-self**: The non-self principle challenges the belief that we have a permanent, unchanging soul. Buddhists believe we have a constant, changing self and to find that it involves releasing desires, finding compassion, and meditating.\n\n**Different Techniques and Practices of Buddhist Meditation**\n\nWithin Buddhist meditation, various forms offer practitioners numerous pathways to explore and expand their minds. These practices complement one another, serving as necessary components to cultivating compassion, wisdom, and deep understanding.\n\nThese can be done in a meditation posture that gives you a comfortable but alert state that doesn't hurt your back or knees, which includes kneeling, lying down, cross-legged, sitting in a chair, or standing up. Complete the meditations in a quiet place, indoors or outside.\n\nHere are a few popular examples of Buddhist meditation:\n\n*   **Samatha Meditation**: One of the main kinds of Theravada meditation, Samatha aims for calm concentration to find internal peace by letting go of desires and cravings.3 Sit in a relaxed posture, bring your hands to your lap or at your knees, and then bring full awareness to the normal pattern of your breath without manipulation.\n*   **Vipassana Meditation**: Vipassana meditation, one of the other main kinds of Theravada meditation, aims for inner insight and to see things as they really are.4 Through self-observation without attachment, the meditator can deconstruct the illusions behind the ego and explore different aspects of existence such as impermanence, dissatisfaction, and non-self.\n*   **Metta Meditation**: Metta meditation", "category": "general"},

It increases awareness, promotes relaxation, reduces stress and anxiety, and improves well-being. It also offers benefits for your physical health.1 If you want to begin meditating, your home is a great place to start, says Steph Strauss, a certified yoga instructor and meditation teacher. This article explores the types of meditation you can try, the benefits of at-home meditation, and tips on how to begin meditating at home.\n\n**How to Meditate at Home**\n\nFind a Cozy Spot\n----------------\n\nFind a cozy area in your home without a lot of distractions. This could be anywhere-your favorite chair, your couch, a corner in your home, your bedroom, or on your bed. You can lay down, if you prefer; however, staying seated can help prevent you from falling asleep-you should ideally be relaxed but alert. It is helpful to meditate in the same spot every day, if possible. This helps your brain create a new healthy habit.\n\nSet a Daily Reminder\n-------------------\n\nIt is helpful to set a reminder to meditate at the same time every day. This can help you build a long-lasting habit.\n\nTake Baby Steps\n----------------\n\nIt takes a lot of practice and patience to focus your attention on one thing at a time. So, taking baby steps when you are just starting is recommended. Try shorter meditations at first and work your way up to longer ones. There is no set time frame after which you should start doing longer meditations; it varies from person to person. So, respect your journey and take as much time as you need.\n\nTry Different Types of Meditation\n----------------------------------\n\nThere are endless types of meditation and what might work best for one person may not work for another at all, and that is just fine. Take some time to explore the different types of meditation and see what is most helpful to you.\n\nBe Kind to Yourself\n----------------------\n\nWhile the practice of meditation is quite simple, it is not easy, nor does it get any easier with time. There will be days when the mind is calmer, times it won't stop yacking, or times when it is somewhere in between. This is normal. It's important to meet yourself where you are in that moment and accept what is present with kindness.\n\n**Types of Meditation You Can Try at Home**\n\nLoving Kindness\n----------------\n\nThis practice is a great way to cultivate compassion for yourself and others. Loving kindness meditations open your heart and help you see how interconnected we all are. In this form of meditation, you are guided to offer different people in your life-yourself, someone close to you, someone neutral, someone you're having difficulty with, and all beings everywhere-loving blessings through a series of phrases. You might say something like: May you be healthy. May you be happy. May you be safe. May you live with ease.\n\nBody Scan\n------------\n\nThis practice is a great way to strengthen your mind-body connection. We aren't taught to notice sensations in the body; however, we can learn a lot when we pay attention to the body. In body scan meditations, you are often guided through a gentle scan of your body from the top of your head to your feet. You will soon notice common areas where you tend to hold tension in the body and will be offered tools to help the body and nervous system relax.\n\nFocused Attention\n-------------------\n\nOne of the most common meditation practices is focused attention. This form of meditation involves placing your awareness on one thing, like your breath, sounds in your environment, a phrase, a candle, or your body. When you start to focus your attention on that one thing, you will soon notice how quickly the mind takes over and brings you into thought. This is normal. When this happens, give yourself credit for noticing and return to your anchor of attention. Bring the mind back as many times as it wanders.\n\n**Benefits of Meditation**\n\nReduces stress and anxiety: Meditation teaches you tools that bring your attention to the present moment without judgment, instead of ruminating about something that happened in the past or worrying about something that hasn't happened yet in the future.2\n\nStrengthens relationships: Meditation helps you cultivate more compassion and patience toward all beings, not just the closest ones to you.\n\nIncreases productivity and creativity: Have you ever had a great idea pop into your head while showering or brushing your teeth? The practice of meditation increases your ability to be productive and creative when you give yourself time to pause and breathe.3\n\nImproves heart health: Meditation can improve heart health by lowering your blood pressure, reducing stress, helping you quit smoking, and helping with other markers of heart disease, such as insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.4\n\nBoosts your immune system: The practice of meditation helps strengthen your mind-body connection. Meditation, in turn, enables you to listen to your body's feedback and teaches you how to self-regulate.\n\nBenefits your brain: The fascinating thing about meditation is its ability to rewire your brain. This concept is called neuroplasticity, where you replace old unhelpful habits with new supportive ones. Meditation has also been shown to improve your ability to process information, stall the effects of aging on your brain, and reduce the sensation of pain.5\n\n**Use Mindfulness Meditation to Ease Anxiety**\n\nA Word From Verywell\n----------------------\n\nMeditation is a practice", "category": "general"},

How Is Mantra Meditation Practiced? Benefits of Mantra Meditation Challenges and Insights How to Begin Mantra Meditation Most of us like the idea of meditating, but the concept of actually taking some moments to pause and sit with our thoughts often seems impossible. We get it! Part of the reason that meditating can feel undoable is that it's so easy to start thinking about other things while you meditate-your daily to-do list, your worries and fears, or other thoughts you might ruminate on. If this is you, you might find that it can be helpful to use a mantra while you meditate. A mantra can help quiet your mind and ground you in the present moment. Not sure what a mantra is and how to use one? We've got you covered. Here, we'll go over everything you need to know about mantra meditation, its benefits, and what to do if you run into challenges.\n\n**What Exactly Is a Mantra?**\n\nMany people think of a mantra as something strange and otherworldly-something only super spiritual people understand or use. But a mantra is actually a fairly simple and straightforward concept, says Gayle Weill, LCSW, clinical social worker with expertise in Mindfulness-Based Therapy. There is so much mystery surrounding the word 'mantra,' but it just refers to any word or syllable that you repeat during a meditation session, Weill says.\n\nSome mantras come from specific spiritual traditions (for example, 'om; is a common mantra that's considered a sacred syllable in Hinduism), while others are simply words that are meaningful to you as an individual. When you use a mantra while meditating, it can help focus your mind and lead you into a deeper meditative state, Weill describes.\n\n1. There are many different types of meditation, including mindfulness meditation, meditation connected with yoga, tai chi, and qi gong, and more spiritual types of meditation.\n2. Mantra-based meditation is when you use a mantra while meditating.\n3. Sometimes your mantra is said out loud and sometimes you say it silently to yourself.\n\n**How Is Mantra Meditation Practiced?**\n\nBesides being uncertain about what a mantra is exactly, many people feel unsure how you would go about practicing mantra meditation. Again, it's pretty simple to practice mantra meditation-that's the beauty of it.\n\nChoosing Your Mantra\n\n1. First, you need to come up with your mantra.\n2. Ashley Lorenzo, a yoga teacher at YogaWorks, says that many people come up with a mantra by looking in ancient yogic texts like Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and Yoga Sutras.\n\n**Benefits of Mantra Meditation**\n\nOne of the main benefits of using a mantra while meditating is that it can ground you and bring you back to the present moment. Weill has seen this benefit up close among the clients she works with.\n\n*   A 2022 study found strong evidence that mantra meditation can help reduce high blood pressure.\n*   There is also some convincing evidence that mantra meditation can help with reducing anxiety and boost your immune system, though more research is needed to be sure.\n*   A 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis similarly found that mantra meditation is strongly correlated in reducing high blood pressure, with reductions in both systolic (the top number on your blood pressure readings) and diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number).\n*   They also conclude that there's evidence mantra meditation can help with anxiety and can generally improve mental health and well being.\n*   A small study from 2022 found that mantra-based AMI Meditation may help improve caregiver stress.\n\n**Challenges and Insights**\n\nHere's the thing: if you're experiencing challenges while embarking on a mantra meditation journey, you are far from alone. Meditation is hard for lots of us, and it's totally normal to feel that way.\n\n*   Some challenges of using a mantra for meditation include difficulty focusing, selecting the appropriate mantra, and maintaining the rhythm of recitation.\n*   It's crucial to acknowledge that these difficulties are common and part of the learning journey in mantra meditation.\n\n**How to Begin Mantra Meditation**\n\nOkay, are you ready to get started?\n\n1.  Pick a mantra that resonates with you, whether that be a word, a phrase, an affirmation, or a traditional mantra from Sanskrit texts.\n2.  It's totally normal for your mind to wander when you first start out; when it does, gently bring your focus back to your mantra.\n3.  In terms of duration, start small; even five minutes of mantra meditation is helpful.\n4.  The key is not to overthink it all (we know-easier said than done). Pick a mantra that speaks to you, and then incorporate it into your meditation routine in a way that works for you.\n\nWhether you're just getting started with meditation or have been practicing it for quite some time, embracing the concept of a mantra can be helpful.

Try the 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique**\n\nWhen we're feeling anxious or panicked, our mind races and our thoughts bounce from one worst case scenario to another.\n\nHowever, there are simple exercises that can help us regain control of our thoughts.\n\nThey're known as grounding techniques, because they help us anchor ourselves in the present moment.\n\nThe 5-4-3-2-1 method is one of the most popular grounding techniques.\n\nA mindfulness exercise, this technique helps us come out of anxiety, unpleasant thoughts, or worries and come into what is right here, right now in the present, through our senses, says Stephanie Strauss, a yoga, meditation, and mindfulness expert.\n\n**Understanding Grounding Techniques**\n\nGrounding techniques are mental and emotional exercises that help us reconnect with the present moment and reduce feelings of anxiety, stress, or dissociation.\n\nWhen our thoughts start to get away from us, using a grounding technique can help us pull our focus away from those thoughts and back to what's happening right now, in our body and in our environment.\n\nThis can help interrupt our stress response and bring a sense of calm.\n\nThere are several types of grounding techniques, including:\n\n*   Sensory grounding: These techniques involve using our senses to anchor ourselves in the present moment.\n*   Physical grounding: These techniques involve physical movements or actions that bring our attention back to our body and the present moment.\n*   Cognitive grounding: These techniques involve engaging our mind in mental activities that shift our focus away from distressing thoughts or emotions.\n*   Environmental grounding: These techniques involve creating a safe and soothing environment to help regulate our emotions and reduce our anxiety.\n\n**How to Do the 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique**\n\nIf you want to try the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique, here's how to do it:\n\n*   Identify 5 things you can see right now.\n*   Identify 4 things you can feel.\n*   Identify 3 things you can hear.\n*   Identify 2 things you can smell.\n*   Identify 1 thing you can taste.\n\nThis exercise uses your senses to anchor you in the present moment, helping you find some calm amidst the chaos.\n\n**Tips for Practicing the 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique**\n\nThese are some tips that can help you practice the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique successfully:\n\n*   Recognize when you need it.\n*   Do it thoroughly.\n*   Avoid judgment.\n*   Check in with yourself.\n*   Repeat the exercise as needed.\n*   Experiment with different variations.\n*   Be kind to yourself.\n\n**Benefits of the 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique**\n\nThese are some of the benefits of practicing the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique:\n\n*   Reduces anxiety.\n*   Improves mindfulness.\n*   Regulates emotions.\n*   Relieves stress and anxiety.\n*   Counters negative thoughts.\n*   Improves concentration.\n\n**When to Use the 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique**\n\nYou can use the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique whenever you feel overwhelmed by anxiety, stress, or strong emotions.\n\nHere are some situations where it may be particularly helpful:\n\n*   During anxiety episodes.\n*   Before an important event.\n*   When feeling overwhelmed.\n*   During emotional upsets.\n*   While dealing with delays.\n*   Before bedtime.  <hr> **References**\n\n1.

Chakras are invisible energy centers in our bodies, positioned from the base of the spine to the top of the head. There are seven in total and each one corresponds to different colors and functions.\n\nChakra meditation helps us explore each of our seven chakras. The process can help you feel more positive, relaxed, and grounded. It can be a great way to level up your self-care routine!\n\n**Introduction to Chakra Meditation**\n\nChakra meditation is an Eastern spiritual practice that dates back thousands of years. The earliest references to it are found in ancient Indian yogic texts dating back to around 1500-1200 BCE.1 It was later adopted by other spiritual systems, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.\n\nChakra is a Sanskrit word that means circle, disc, or wheel, says Helbert. There are seven chakras in total, positioned from the base of the spine to the top of the head.2 Although the chakras aren't scientifically recognized, in the context of this belief system, they are invisible energy centers within the body that vibrate and spin with energy.\n\nEach chakra influences the glands in its vicinity.2 Therefore, each chakra corresponds to different qualities and functions, Helbert explains. Imbalances or blockages in any of the chakras are linked to physical or mental health problems. Chakra meditation helps us realign the chakras and bring our body back into balance.\n\nWhen the chakras are aligned and activated, they vibrate at a higher frequency, giving us energy and vitality. The chakras regulate and generate functions that impact us physically, energetically, emotionally, mentally, sensorially, intuitively, and spiritually.\n\n*   - KARLA HELBERT, YOGA THERAPIST\n\n**The Seven Chakras**\n\nBefore we go further, let's take a quick tour of the seven chakras.\n\n1.  **Root Chakra**\n    *   Name: Muladhara\n    *   Location: Base of the spine\n    *   Color: Red\n    *   Associations: Health, safety, security, and stability\n    *   Imbalances: Fear, insecurity, anxiety, financial stress, and substance use\n\n2.  **Sacral Chakra**\n    *   Name: Svadhisthana\n    *   Location: Lower abdomen (a little below your belly button)\n    *   Color: Orange\n    *   Associations: Creativity, passion, pleasure, and emotional well-being\n    *   Imbalances: Creative blocks, emotional instability, dependency issues, and intimacy issues\n\n3.  **Solar Plexus Chakra**\n    *   Name: Manipura\n    *   Location: Upper abdomen (above your belly button)\n    *   Color: Yellow\n    *   Associations: Confidence, willpower, gut instincts, and inner strength\n    *   Imbalances: Low self-esteem, difficulty concentrating, control issues, stress, and digestive difficulties\n\n4.  **Heart Chakra**\n    *   Name: Anahata\n    *   Location: Center of the chest (near your heart)\n    *   Color: Pink or green\n    *   Associations: Love, compassion, forgiveness, and emotional balance\n    *   Imbalances: Lack of empathy, relationship difficulties, and heart problems\n\n5.  **Throat Chakra**\n    *   Name: Vishuddha\n    *   Location: Throat area\n    *   Color: Blue\n    *   Associations: Communication, truth, honesty, clarity, and inspiration\n    *   Imbalances: Fear of speaking, difficulty expressing oneself, nervousness, sore throat, clogged sinuses, and tooth, gum, or jaw pain\n\n6.  **Third Eye Chakra**\n    *   Name: Ajna\n    *   Location: Center of your forehead (between your brows)\n    *   Color: Indigo\n    *   Associations: Intuition, insight, imagination, and spiritual awareness\n    *   Imbalances: Lack of clarity, difficulty making decisions, eye problems, headaches, migraines, and sleep issues\n\n7.  **Crown Chakra**\n    *   Name: Sahasrara\n    *   Location: Top of the head\n    *   Color: Violet or white\n    *   Associations: Spirituality, divine connection, and enlightenment\n    *   Imbalances: Depression, loss of faith, and", "category": "general"},
{"title": "I Tried Junk Journaling For a Month-Here's What Happened", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/i-tried-junk-journaling-for-a-month-11679873", "content": "& Questions 1 2 3 4 References: 1 Lisa Anderson LCSW is the clinical director at Brooks Healing Center, Tennessee. 2 Allison Barton, a San Diego-based therapist specializing in trauma, anxiety, and perfectionism. 3 Janet Bayramyan LCSW. Note: Some sources may not be directly quoted but are acknowledged in this piece. **My Weekly Junk Journaling Experience** To stay as close to the theme as possible, I decided to create my own notebook for this experiment by repurposing discarded scraps. You can see a couple of pages from my journal at the top of this article. I used an old wedding card to make the notebook cover and cut and stapled old newspaper sheets, paper bags, and leftover wrapping paper to make the pages.\n\n**Why Junk Journaling Works**\n\nIt May Lower Stress And Anxiety There is something incredibly freeing about not worrying if your handwriting is neat or your thoughts make sense. Instead of writing in structured sentences, you can use colors, textures, and images to express your feelings. This creative self-expression has been shown to help reduce stress, ease anxiety, and improve overall mood.\n\n**Should You Try Junk Journaling?**\n\nSince junk journaling focuses on creative self-expression rather than skill, it's suitable for people of all ages and artistic abilities, says Barton. It's particularly helpful for those who struggle with perfectionism as it promotes free and non-judgmental creative exploration, she adds. \n\n**Alternatives to Junk Journaling**\n\nIf junk journaling is not quite your thing, no worries! Several alternative activities offer comparable mental health benefits. For example: \n1. Coloring\n2. Bullet Journaling\n3. Collage Making\n4. Clay Modeling\n5. Diamond Art\n6. Gardening\n7. Knitting\n8. Crocheting\n9. Zentangling\n\nThe key is to choose a creative outlet that feels natural and enjoyable to you-one that gives your brain a break while also helping you express yourself, says Anderson.\n\n**Takeaway**\n\nWill I keep junk journaling after this month-long experiment? Absolutely. It may have started as a curious dip into a TikTok trend, but I can see junk journaling as a fun addition to my self-care toolkit-one that has helped me slow down, be more present, and more grateful for life's little moments.\n\nAm I suggesting everyone should start junk journaling, though? Not necessarily. Self-care is like Cinderella's shoe, one size doesn't fit all. Like the experts said, choose what resonates with you the most.", "category": "general"},

{"title": "How You Should Meditate, According to Your Personality", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/meditation-personality-8667853", "content": "on This Article\n\n**How You Should Meditate, According to Your Personality**\n\n**Can Meditation Work for All Personality Types?**\n\nAt its core, meditation is about observing your thoughts without judgment and staying present.\n\n*   It helps build emotional regularity and a healthier relationship with your mind so that you're not a victim to every negative or hurtful thought that passes.\n*   However, meditation is not a one-size-fits-all technique.\n*   How you meditate relies on your personality.\n\n**Choosing a Practice Based On Your Meditation Personality**\n\nThere's no exact science to find the best meditation technique for your personality.\n\nBecause, truly, how you meditate is a personal decision.\n\nBut if you're a newbie to meditation and are unsure where to start-and which practice works best-we found the best meditation technique for every personality type.\n\n**For Introverts: Mindfulness Meditation**\n\nIntroverts harness energy in their alone time and expend energy in social situations.\n\nAs such, they may enjoy mindfulness meditation in a quiet, calm, and familiar setting.\n\n*   Mindfulness meditation involves paying attention to the present moment and focusing on the breath, body sensations, and sounds.\n*   It reduces stress, enhances self-awareness, and improves emotional regulation and mental clarity.\n\n**For Extroverts: Group Meditation**\n\nExtroverts thrive in the hustle and bustle of the world and fuel themselves through social interactions.\n\nThat said, they still benefit from the calming and grounding effects of meditation but in a group or class setting.\n\n*   Group meditation involves meditating alongside others, usually in an in-person or virtual class aided by an instructor.\n*   Along with the therapeutic benefits, this group meditation fosters community and can deepen an extrovert's meditation experience through collective energy.\n\n**For Creatives: Artful Meditation**\n\nCreative people are often drawn to making things, be it painting, drawing, coloring, sewing, or beyond.\n\nThere's something innately therapeutic about diving into an art project for this personality type, and engaging in creative activities can help focus their mind and help them forget outside stressors.\n\n*   Artful meditation, or meditative art, fuses this creativity with mindfulness.\n*   It involves engaging in artistic activities like drawing, painting, or coloring while maintaining a meditative focus on the process.\n*   The form of practice boosts relaxation, provides an opportunity for self-expression, and encourages mindfulness.\n\n**For Music Lovers: Sound Baths**\n\nThose drawn to music appreciate the combination of sounds coming together to create harmonies, rhythms, and vibrations.\n\nIf that resonates with you, then consider sound baths, which can provide a deeply immersive and emotional experience.\n\n*   A sound bath is a meditative experience where participants are bathed in sound waves produced by instruments like gongs, singing bowls, and chimes.\n*   Research has found that vibrations help reduce stress, improve emotional well-being, and enhance mental clarity.\n\n**For Type A Personalities: Breathwork Meditation**\n\nType A personalities are always striving for order and are quick to accomplish any goal before them.\n\nThis often leads them to burnout and perfectionism.\n\nMeditation can help assuage these pitfalls, particularly breathwork meditation.\n\n*   This meditation method focuses on controlling and manipulating breath to calm our bodies, minds, and emotional states.\n*   It's also very structured and orderly, which can appeal to type A people.\n\n**For Type B Personalities: Walking Meditation**\n\nType B personalities are pretty relaxed, easy-going, patient, and adaptable.\n\nThey benefit from flexible and open-ended practices that allow for exploration and creativity.\n\nAnd walking meditation-either through nature or around the block-offers exactly that.\n\n*   Walking meditation combines movement with mindfulness, focusing on the sensations of walking, such as the feel of the ground underfoot and the rhythm of the steps.\n*   It can also create a deeper connection with one's surroundings as you walk through the landscape.\n\n**For Pessimists: Loving-Kindness Meditation**\n\nPessimists typically have a glass half empty mentality as they navigate life, often focusing on the downsides versus the positives.\n\nWhile this arguably realistic point of view isn't all bad, it's important to find the beauty in yourself and the world around you.\n\n*   Enter: Loving-Kindness Meditation.\n*   This form of meditation involves cultivating feelings of compassion, kindness, and goodwill toward yourself and others.\n*   For pessimists-who may struggle with negative self-talk and skepticism towards others-loving-kindness meditation offers a structured practice to cultivate positive emotions and empathy.\n\n**For Optimists: Affirmation Meditation**\n\nBy their very nature, optimists tend to see the brighter side of situations, expecting favorable outcomes and maintaining a hopeful attitude.\n\nFor them, affirmation meditation is a form of meditation that can help reinforce their positive beliefs and further cultivate that optimism.\n\n*   Affirmation meditation involves repeating positive statements aloud or silently.\n*   These may be phrases like I am capable, I attract positive experiences, or I trust in my ability to overcome challenges.\n*   By consciously affirming uplifting statements, optimists strengthen their positive mindset, enjoy a nice boost to their self-esteem, and sustain their natural inclination towards seeing possibilities and opportunities.\n\n**For the Easily Distracted: Guided Meditation**\n\nIf you find it difficult to sit still or are easily distracted, you may get the most bang out of a guided meditation.\n\nThis structured approach allows you to show up and follow instructions.\n\n*   In guided meditation, a narrator guides the practitioner through the meditation, often focusing on relaxation, visualization, or specific themes like gratitude or compassion.\n*   Guided voice meditation provides a clear framework and can be easier to follow, making it accessible for people new to meditation or those who find it difficult to focus on their own. **Final Thoughts**\n\nUltimately, the best type of meditation for you is the one that you personally enjoy and benefit from practicing.\n\nTry a few different types and see what feels right.\n\nYou may also find that having a few variations in your back pocket allows you to keep things varied in your day-to-day life. **How Long Should You Meditate?**\n\nRead More: LIVING WELL MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION 2

Let yourself become immersed in the different paths and patterns the trail of smoke begins to take.\n5.  If other thoughts come into your head, gently bring your attention back to the trail of smoke left from the incense.\n\n**Benefits**\n\n*   Easing stress\n*   Improving concentration while meditating\n*   Improving mindfulness\n*   Invoking pleasant memories\n*   Promoting relaxation\n\n**Potential Risks**\n\n1.

Limiting your incense use and not inhaling the smoke can help, but you might also consider a different type of meditation if you are concerned about these risks. A Word From Verywell Meditating with incense can be a pleasant way to enhance your meditation experience. You may find this approach particularly useful if you use scents that are believed to help promote relaxation, such as lavender and sage.

Savasana can improve depression symptoms by reducing cortisol levels and promoting relaxation in individuals with anxiety disorders. A small study looked at the effects of practicing savasana on 30 patients with depression in India. On average, the patients' depression scores were significantly lower after savasana. 2. Floor time activates the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), which counters the stress response and promotes relaxation. When you're stressed or anxious, your body is in a state of 'fight or flight.' The PNS helps you relax, recover, and repair. 3. Mindfulness practices have been shown to improve symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. While floor time might not be a traditional mindfulness practice, it allows for a natural, effortless connection with the breath, body, and present moment. References:    Kamal, Y. (2020).

That's where accommodations and modifications come in.\n\n*   If lying on your back isn't for you, try lying on your side.\n*   If your lower back gets sore, try raising your knees while keeping your feet on the ground, hip-distance apart.\n*   Kamal and Benzaken recommend placing a prop-like a bolster, folded blanket, or blocks-underneath your knees.  - **Final Thoughts: Is Floor Time Worth Trying?**\n\nFloor time is one of the simplest, zero-cost wellness trends to emerge on TikTok, and its benefits for relaxation, mindfulness, and spinal health make it worth incorporating into your routine.\n\n*   Whether you try it for five minutes after work or use it as part of a bedtime ritual, floor time is an easy, no-pressure way to give your mind and body a break.\n*   So, next time you're feeling overwhelmed, try lying on the floor and see how it makes you feel. Sometimes, the simplest habits have the biggest impact.  - **References**\n\n1.

{"title": "How to Set SMART Goals", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/smart-goals-for-lifestyle-change-2224097", "content": "How SMART goals work in therapy The SMART goal template is often used in therapy settings, especially when working with patients who struggle with motivation or reaching their mental health goals. Your therapist may ask you to use the SMART goal framework as a way of breaking down large goals into smaller steps that are achievable and measurable. Using SMART Goals in Therapy A therapist will work with you to create specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals for your therapy sessions. This helps ensure progress toward recovery is happening regularly. The goal can be tailored based on the individual's needs and may involve a combination of the following: 1. Identifying and challenging negative thoughts patterns or behaviors that are causing distress 2. Learning new coping strategies to manage anxiety, depression, or other mental health concerns 3. Improving communication skills with family members or friends 4. Building self-esteem through positive affirmations and self-care activities 5. Setting boundaries in relationships to promote healthy emotional regulation When you create SMART goals with your therapist, it's essential to remember that they are not one-size-fits-all solutions. You work together to develop a plan tailored to your unique needs and circumstances. Using SMART Goals Outside of Therapy While setting SMART goals can be beneficial for anyone, using them in therapy can provide an added layer of support and accountability. If you're working on your mental health independently, you may still find it helpful to create SMART goals as a way to stay motivated and track progress. This template is useful for breaking down larger objectives into smaller steps that are achievable and measurable. Using the SMART goal framework can help you identify what specific actions need to be taken to achieve your goals and provide a clear roadmap for success. If you're struggling with anxiety, depression, or other mental health concerns, consider using SMART goals as part of your treatment plan or in conjunction with therapy. Next Steps in The End of the Resolution Guide 1\\. Understand how SMART goals can help you define changes you want to make in your life and come up with a plan to achieve them. 2\\. Use the SMART goal template to break down large goals into smaller, achievable steps. 3\\. Identify what specific actions need to be taken to achieve your goals and create a clear roadmap for success. 4\\. Track progress and review results regularly to make adjustments as needed. 5\\.

For example:\n\n1\\. Approach goals tend to be more effective than avoidance goals.\n\n2\\. Performance goals may be less effective than mastery goals.\n\n**How to Set SMART Goals**\n\nYou can set SMART goals on your own or use them in therapy. Here's a template you can use to define your SMART goal:\n\n*   I will [your goal here] by [how you will do the goal].\n*   I will know I am making progress because [how you will measure the goal] for [time goes here].\n\n**Tips For Goal Setting**\n\nHere are some tips that will help make your SMART goals stick:\n\n1\\. Write your goal down and go back to it often.\n\n2\\. Keep in mind that life happens. Making adjustments to your goal is part of the learning process.\n\n3\\. Don't beat yourself up if something has to change.\n\n4\\. Be realistic about your expectations.\n\n5\\. Focus on process goals instead of just the outcome.\n\n6\\. Think about changing behaviors and habits.\n\n7\\. Remember that someone else's goals are not your goals. Your goals have to be meaningful and attainable for you.\n\n**Using SMART Goals in Therapy**\n\nA therapist may ask you to use the SMART goal framework as a way of breaking down large goals into smaller steps that are achievable and measurable.

It can interfere with a person's ability to live their life and cause significant distress. The symptoms of atelophobia include:\n\n*   Having unrealistic goals\n*   Judging oneself harshly for not meeting those goals\n*   Being unable to accept feedback\n*   Experiencing fear and anxiety when faced with situations where mistakes might be made\n\nThe causes of atelophobia can vary, but may include trauma, upbringing, genetic factors, or toxic situations. It is classified as a specific phobia, an intense, irrational fear of something that doesn't pose any threat.\n\nAtelophobia is not the same as perfectionism. While both conditions involve striving for flawlessness, atelophobia is driven by a fear of failure and can be debilitating. Treatment for atelophobia typically involves therapy, such as exposure therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), or mindfulness-based interventions, and in some cases, medication.\n\nCoping strategies for atelophobia include getting used to making mistakes, finding ways to calm oneself, leaving toxic situations, and building a support system. If you are experiencing symptoms of atelophobia, it is recommended that you seek evaluation by a mental health professional who specializes in treating anxiety disorders. \n\nReferences:   1.  \"Perfectionism.\" The Perfectionist's Guide to Letting Go.

It can also foster self-reflection and personal growth.\n\nSome of the benefits include:\n\n*   Improved personal exploration\n*   Increased creativity\n*   More social energy\n\nImproved Personal Exploration\n-----------------------------\n\nBecoming comfortable in your own company can give you the time and freedom to truly explore your own passions without interference.\n\nIt can be a way to explore new things, research topics that interest you, gain knowledge, and even practice new forms of self-expression.\n\nTaking some time for yourself allows you to explore these aspects free from the pressures and judgments of others.\n\nIncreased Creativity\n--------------------\n\nAlone time is an opportunity to let your mind wander and strengthen your creativity.\n\nWithout the need to care for or interact with other people, you can ignore outside influences and focus inward.\n\nResearch actually suggests that being alone can lead to changes in the brain that help fuel the creative process.\n\nMore Social Energy\n-----------------\n\nLiving alone is often portrayed in a negative light. However, researchers have found that people who live alone may actually have richer social lives and more social energy than people who cohabitate with others.\n\nChallenges\n==========\n\nSolitude can be challenging for some people for a variety of reasons.\n\nSome research found that many people would prefer to give themselves painful electric shocks rather than sit alone with their own thoughts.\n\nSome of these reasons people might struggle with being alone include:\n\n*   Lack of experience being alone: Some people might not be used to being alone because they are so accustomed to being around other people.\n*   Distressing thoughts and feelings: In other cases, being alone and focusing inward can be difficult or even painful.\n*   Social stigma: Stigma about being alone can also shape how people feel about solitude.\n\nPersonality and Alone Time\n-------------------------\n\nAspects of your personality, as well as your individual preferences, can play a role in determining how much alone time you need and how beneficial it may be.\n\nExtroverts tend to feel energized by social experiences, for example, which means that solitude might be more challenging for them.\n\nHowever, don't think that just because you are an extrovert you won't enjoy spending time by yourself.\n\nIn one study, social psychologist Thuy-vy Thi Nguyen found that introverts and extroverts didn't actually differ in how much enjoyment they gained from solitude.\n\nAloneness vs. Loneliness\n------------------------\n\nEven before the global pandemic, experts warned that a loneliness epidemic was threatening the wellness of people of all ages.\n\nResearch suggests that people experience more loneliness now than they have in the past.\n\nHowever, being alone doesn't equal loneliness.\n\nWhere loneliness is marked by negative feelings associated with isolation, alone time involves finding freedom, inspiration, and rejuvenation in solitude.\n\nSigns You Need It\n-----------------\n\nRecognizing when you need time away from others isn't always easy.\n\nSome signs to watch for include:\n\n*   Feeling short-tempered\n*   Getting easily irritated by sometimes minor things\n*   Losing interest in doing things with other people\n*   Feeling overwhelmed or overstimulated\n*   Having trouble concentrating\n*   Getting anxious about spending time with other people\n\nWays to Get It\n-----------------\n\nIf you're craving some time to yourself, it is crucial to do so in ways that support your mental well-being.\n\nBeing alone is most beneficial when it is voluntary.\n\nFeeling like you can return to your social world whenever you like is also essential.\n\nSome steps to take include:\n\n*   Be clear: Tell the people around you, whether they are roommates, family members, or your partner, that you need time alone.\n*   Be specific: Let people know what this means. For example, you might say that you need a certain amount of uninterrupted time to read a book, watch a television show, or listen to a podcast.\n*   Return the favor: If people are willing to take steps to ensure that you get some alone time, it is important for you to show them the same consideration. Offer to take on some responsibilities while they have some space to themselves.\n\nGetting Others to Respect It\n------------------------------\n\nFinding time to be alone isn't always easy.\n\nThose around you may have different social needs and may not understand your need for solitude.\n\nFamily obligations and parenting responsibilities can also make it tough to carve out time for yourself.\n\nSome steps that you can take include:\n\n*   Be clear: Tell the people around you, whether they are roommates, family members, or your partner, that you need time alone.\n*   Be specific: Let people know what this means. For example, you might say that you need a certain amount of uninterrupted time to read a book, watch a television show, or listen to a podcast.\n*   Return the favor: If people are willing to take steps to ensure that you get some alone time, it is important for you to show them the same consideration. Offer to take on some responsibilities while they have some space to themselves.\n\nTips to Overcome a Fear of Alone Time\n----------------------------------------\n\nIf the thought of being alone makes you fear you'll feel lonely, research suggests that reframing time spent alone as solitude may be helpful.\n\nIn one study, participants were assigned to read about the prevalence of loneliness, a passage about the benefits of solitude, or an unrelated topic.\n\nAfter completing this reading, the participants sat alone for 10 minutes. In each condition, people experienced decreases in both negative and positive feelings.\n\nSuch results suggest that while being alone might not always boost your mood, it can help you better regulate your emotions. \n\nThe study also found that while people who read about the benefits of solitude didn't necessarily experience a better mood, they didn't experience the same reduction of positive feelings as those in the other two groups.\n\nSuch findings suggest that reassessing how you look at spending time alone can play an important role in moderating the potentially negative effects of loneliness.

{"title": "Understanding Emotions", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/emotions-4157165", "content": "**LIVING WELL Understanding Emotions**\n\nWhile we are all wired differently, our emotions-and the ways in which we feel and respond to the world around us-make us unique. They allow us to realize what's most important to us, from the people we care about to the opinions we hold, and force us to navigate the complexities of everyday life. They may also give us a glimpse into patterns stemming from our childhood experiences.\n\n**The 6 Types of Basic Emotions and Their Effect on Human Behavior**\n\nEmotions and types of emotional responses are complex and multifaceted. Understanding these concepts can help you better navigate your relationships, make informed decisions, and cultivate healthy coping mechanisms.\n\n*   Learn where emotions originate\n*   Discover how they affect our lives and behaviors\n*   Understand why they manifest in the ways that they do\n\n**Emotions and Types of Emotional Responses**\n\nEmotions are influenced by a network of interconnected structures in the brain that make up what is known as the limbic system. Key structures including the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the limbic cortex play a pivotal role in emotions and behavioral responses.\n\n**The Important Role of Emotions**\n\nEmotions are essential for our well-being and success.

Key structures including the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the limbic cortex play a pivotal role in emotions and behavioral responses.\n\n**Can we control our emotions?**\n\nAs human beings, we have the ability to self-regulate, or manage our thoughts, behaviors, and emotions-allowing us to better handle stress, deal with conflict, and accomplish our goals. We can continue to develop our self-regulation skills through mindfulness strategies and exercises.\n\n**KEY TERMS**\n\n*   **Emotional Intelligence**: The ability to perceive, control, and evaluate emotions.\n*   **Emotion Wheel**: An emotion classification system introduced by psychologist Robert Plutchik in the 1980s.\n*   **Expression**: The act of communicating our thoughts and emotions with others, verbally or non-verbally.\n*   **Mood**: A relatively stable affective state that is often described as positive or negative.\n\n**EXPLORE UNDERSTANDING EMOTIONS**\n\nThis section features a curated list of articles and resources to help you better understand emotions and develop healthy coping mechanisms.

So far, a surprising amount of studies have been done about this category of supplement, with some excellent results, but it's worth noting that research is still ongoing.\n\n*   Can Help With Immunity\n*   May Improve Energy\n*   Reduce Stress\n*   Improved Cognition\n\n**Taking Lion's Mane Daily**\n\nNow that I was fully jazzed for everything lion's mane could help with, I switched over from my usual mushroom combo, which I had taken consistently for about three years, and started taking lion's mane extract instead.\n\n1.  Week 1: \n    *   The first week of taking lion's mane went smoothly.\n    *   I began to notice that my afternoon slumps were feeling decidedly less slumpy.\n\n2.  Week 2:\n    *   Ever since entering perimenopause, my PMS week has had intense symptoms, one of which is brain fog. \n    *   The lion's mane alone was not cutting it for me cognitively.\n    *   I started noticing that I was feeling scattered, so about halfway through the week, I added my usual powder back in.\n    *   The cognitive issues disappeared within a day.\n\n3.  Week 3:\n    *   The addition of lion's mane to my daily 'shroom fix continued to help my energy improve.\n    *   My afternoons felt weirdly normal, and I experienced as much energy as I had most mornings, which hasn't happened to me for years.\n    *   I found myself more motivated to do things I'm generally too exhausted to even contemplate.\n\n4.  Week 4:\n    *   During the fourth week of taking lion's mane, a good friend of mine got a cold.\n    *   We had spent time together in close physical proximity the week before she got sick.\n    *   I didn't catch her cold, and it made me realize I haven't gotten sick yet this season.\n\n**Should You Take Lion's Mane for Energy and Mood?**\n\nDisclaimer\n\nAs with any other supplements, be sure to first check with your healthcare provider to see if lion's mane is right for you. Many people can benefit from this mushroom, but don't expect to notice a huge difference right away, whether you have a history of taking them or not.\n\nWright notes that benefits may take up to a few weeks to be noticeable, so be patient and consistent with supplementation. To make sure they're working out for you, she suggests,\n\n*   When you start taking lion's mane, keep track of any changes in mood, cognition, digestion, energy, or allergies.\n\n**The Risks**\n\nLion's mane has perks, including the potential to perk you up, but they aren't suitable for absolutely everyone. As you could guess, people who are allergic to mushrooms are not candidates for taking them in a supplement and or medicinal manner. They are also a potential conflict for people who have blood sugar issues.\n\nWatch for symptoms of hypoglycemia, as lion's mane can impact blood sugar levels, says Guan. To prevent that, she recommends that you start with the lowest dose and increase it as long as it is well tolerated.\n\nAccordingly, this supplement should be avoided by anyone with diabetes, especially those who take medication for it. Wright tells us to also avoid lion's mane if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, if you take blood thinning meds-they can have a blood thinning effect and could increase your risk of bleeding-or if you take immunosuppressive drugs as they stimulate the immune system.\n\n**Takeaway**\n\nI didn't really expect to notice anything by taking lion's mane alone because I had already been using it in a small dose, so I was very pleasantly surprised by my experience with it. If you haven't delved into the world of mushrooms before, and you don't have any of the contraindications listed above, I'd highly suggest an extract like this one to start.\n\nMissing out on the funky, dirt-like taste is a big step up from whisking a clump of powder into your morning beverage! Lion's mane could potentially help with your immunity, cognition, mood, and more, so it might be worth a try. \n\n**Read More: LIVING WELL SELF-IMPROVEMENT 5 Sources**\n\nBy Ariane Resnick, CNC\n\nAriane Resnick, CNC is a mental health writer, certified nutritionist, and wellness author who advocates for accessibility and inclusivity.

{"title": "How Do I Stop Feeling Like I'm Behind in Life?", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/how-do-i-stop-feeling-like-im-behind-in-life-11729611", "content": "Share this article on Facebook Share this article on Twitter Share this article via email What does it mean to feel behind in life, and how can you overcome those feelings? Read more about it here.\n\n**Why It's So Easy to Feel Behind**\n\nFeeling behind in life can sneak up on you in all sorts of moments-while scrolling through social media, enjoying a dinner with family or friends, or even just lying awake at night wondering if you took a wrong turn somewhere. Humans are naturally inclined to compare themselves to others due to both evolutionary and social factors. Historically, comparison helped individuals assess their social standing, a crucial element for survival, says Carolina Casillas, PhD, LPC, a therapist at the Clinical Mental Health Counseling Faculty at University of Phoenix. In today's modern world, that comparison is amplified by societal pressures, but also through social media highlight reels. At any hour of the day, we're exposed to a carefully curated display of others' wins with little context for what else is going on in their life or the struggles they may have endured to find their own successes.\n\n**Common Areas People Feel Behind in Life**\n\n*   Career and professional life, like getting a raise, starting a business, earning an award, or getting a new job.\n*   Personal milestones, such as getting married, having a baby, or taking a fancy vacation.\n*   Financial stability, which can include investing, buying a house, or retiring.\n*   Education and achievements, such as earning a degree, going back to school, or developing a new skill.\n*   Social and family life, including making close friends, maintaining strong relationships, or feeling like you've found your people.\n*   Health and wellness, whether it's hitting fitness goals, dropping excess weight, healing from chronic illness, or sticking to a balanced lifestyle.\n*   Creative or personal growth, such as writing a book or pursuing a passion project.\n\n**How to Overcome Feelings Of 'Being Behind in Life'**\n\n1.  **Understand That Everyone Is On Their Own Path**: Comparison is often a knee-jerk reaction we experience when we see another person's wins. In these moments, you must remind yourself that there is no singular right timeline or journey to follow in life.\n2.  **Use Jealousy as a Tool**: Jealousy, while a very painful emotion to experience, can be an extremely valuable tool. It shows you what you want in life and also what's possible.\n3.  **Deeply Examine Your Feelings**: What you're feeling might seem like jealousy on the surface, but it's also worth asking if that's really what's going on. Sometimes, what we label as envy is actually grief over a missed opportunity, frustration from feeling stuck, or longing for a life that feels more aligned with who we are.\n4.  **Practice Self-Compassion**: It is essential that feelings of being behind in life are met with a sense of self-compassion versus self-criticism.\n5.  **Define and Prioritize Your Own Goals**: One of the fastest ways to feel like you're falling behind is by chasing goals that were never yours to begin with. Social expectations, family pressure, and curated glimpses into other people's lives can all blur the line between what you truly want and what you think you should want. That's why it's essential to pause and define success on your own terms. Redefine what 'having it together' means to you. Not in theory, but in practice, says Rudolph. Is it being financially stable enough to take a risk? Is it having a few people in your corner who really get you? Is it finding a new job? Once you've clarified what actually matters to you, you can start prioritizing your time and energy around those goals-rather than trying to keep pace with someone else's journey. There's real power in choosing intention over imitation.  \\[1] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7425113/. \\[2] https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33476194/. \\[3] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7492349/.

You can also print it out for later use.\n\n**The Midlife Crisis Quiz**\n\nWho Is This Quiz For?\nThis quiz is for anyone who's experiencing midlife and wondering if they're having a full-blown midlife crisis. Midlife is generally considered to be the period between the ages of 40 and 60, plus or minus 10 years.\n\nWhat Are the Signs of a Midlife Crisis?\n\n*   Feeling dissatisfied: You might experience a sense of dissatisfaction or disillusionment with your life.\n*   Having an identity crisis: You may find yourself feeling very lost or uncertain.\n*   Questioning your choices: You may question your life decisions, both big and small, wondering if they're right for you.\n*   Fearing getting old: You might think about getting older, losing your health or fertility, falling sick, or dying-and these thoughts might terrify you.\n*   Wishing for change: You may find yourself wanting to alter your job, lifestyle, appearance, or surroundings, just for the sake of making a change.\n*   Being impulsive: You might crave change so badly that you may find yourself doing something drastic, reckless, or impulsive.\n*   Wanting to escape: You may constantly feel like you just want to escape your life and get away from it all.\n*   Reminiscing about your youth: You may feel nostalgic about your youth and wish for the days gone by.

A person's genes and environment influence this condition, which is widely viewed as a brain disease due to its impact on the brain's reward, pleasure, and self-control circuits.\n\n**Understanding Addiction**\n\nAddiction can be understood in various ways:\n\n*   Can Tapering Off Alcohol Prevent Withdrawal?\n*   What Does It Mean to Be Sober Curious?\n*   Can Self-Improvement Feel Like Too Much of a Good Thing?\n\nThe symptoms used to diagnose substance use disorders are:\n\n1.  Taking the substance in larger amounts or over a longer period than intended.\n2.  A persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control substance use.\n3.  Spending a lot of time getting, using, or recovering from the effects of the substance.\n4.  Craving or a strong desire or urge to use the substance.\n5.  Recurrent substance use resulting in failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home.\n6.  Continued substance use despite having persistent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the substance.\n\n**Causes of Addiction**\n\nMultiple factors influence the process of addiction, including:\n\n*   Genetics\n*   Diet\n*   Mental health\n*   Past traumas\n*   Pain\n*   Stress\n*   Stage of life\n\n**Breaking an Addiction**\n\nThe first step in overcoming addiction is to desire change and avoid people, places, and things that promote the addiction. Support groups, mentors, and 12-step programs provide help, while counselors, recovery centers, and physicians provide expertise and medication to treat cravings and withdrawal symptoms.\n\nEating healthy and getting exercise also play an important role in recovery.\n\n**Is Addiction Genetic?**\n\nA person's genetics account for about half of their risk for developing an addiction. The impact of genetics is influenced by an interaction between a person's environment, diet, and biology. Alcoholism, like other addictions, tends to run in families, and members of those families are at increased risk for developing alcoholism.\n\n**Key Terms**\n\n*   Substance Use Disorder\n*   Behavioral Addiction\n*   Intervention\n*   Comorbidity\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n*   Is addiction a disease?\n*   What causes addiction?\n*   How can you break an addiction?\n*   Is addiction genetic?\n\n**Related Articles**\n\n*   What Is Addiction?

{"title": "What to Do When You Have No Motivation", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/what-to-do-when-you-have-no-motivation-4796954", "content": "on This Page Verywell Mind uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed articles, to support the facts in our articles. Read our editorial process to learn more about how we fact-check and keep our content accurate, reliable, and trustworthy.\n\n**What to Do When You Have No Motivation**\n\n**Act as If You Feel Motivated**\n\nWhen you're struggling with motivation, try to trick yourself into feeling motivated by changing your behavior. Act as if you felt motivated, and your actions may change your emotions. Get dressed and get moving instead of sitting on the couch in your pajamas all day waiting for motivation to strike.\n\n*   Ask yourself what you'd be doing right now if you felt motivated.\n*   Consider what you'd be wearing, how you'd be thinking, and what actions you'd be taking.\n*   Then do these things, and see if your motivation level increases.\n\n**Argue the Opposite**\n\nWhen you're struggling with motivation, you'll likely come up with a long list of reasons why you shouldn't take any action. Try arguing the opposite. When you think you're going to fail, argue all the reasons why you might succeed. Or when you think you can't finish a job, list all the evidence that shows you'll be able to complete the task.\n\n*   Arguing the opposite can help you see both ends of the spectrum.\n*   It can also remind you that an overly pessimistic outcome isn't completely accurate.\n*   There's a chance that things might work out better than you expect.\n\n**Practice Self-Compassion**\n\nYou might think being hard on yourself is the key to getting motivated. But harsh self-criticism doesn't work. Research shows that self-compassion is actually much more motivating, especially when you are struggling with adversity.\n\n*   Practice using self-talk that encourages you and helps you recover from setbacks.\n*   Coach yourself in a helpful manner.\n*   Speak to yourself like a trusted friend.\n\n**Use the 10-Minute Rule**\n\nWhen you dread doing something, give yourself permission to quit a task after 10 minutes. When you reach the 10-minute mark, ask yourself if you want to keep going or quit. You'll likely find that you have enough motivation to keep going.\n\n*   Getting started on a task is usually the hardest part.\n*   Once you get going, it's much easier to keep going.\n\n**Go For a Walk in Nature**\n\nFresh air, a change of scenery, and a little exercise can do wonders for your motivation. Walking in nature-as opposed to a busy urban street-can be especially beneficial.\n\n*   Being in nature offers a calming effect that rejuvenates the brain.\n*   It can help you feel more motivated to tackle a tough task.\n\n**Pair a Dreaded Task With Something You Enjoy**\n\nYour emotions play a major role in your motivation level. If you're sad, bored, lonely, or anxious, your desire to tackle a tough challenge or complete a tedious task will suffer. Boost your mood by adding a little fun to something you're not motivated to do.\n\n*   Listen to music while you run.\n*   Call a friend and talk while you're cleaning the house.\n*   Light a scented candle while you're working on your computer.\n\n**Manage Your To-Do List**\n\nIt's tough to feel motivated when your to-do list is overwhelming. If you feel like there's no hope in getting everything done, you might not try to do anything. Take a look at your to-do list and determine if it's too long.\n\n*   Get rid of tasks that aren't essential.\n*   See if other tasks can be moved to a different day.\n*   Prioritize the most important things on the list.\n\n**Practice Self-Care**\n\nYou'll struggle with motivation as long as you aren't caring for yourself. Create a healthy self-care plan that allows you to take care of your mind and body:\n\n*   Exercise regularly.\n*   Get plenty of sleep.\n*   Drink water, and eat a healthy diet.\n*   Make time for leisure and fun.\n\n**Reward Yourself for Working**\n\nCreate a small reward for yourself that you can earn for your hard work. You might find focusing on the reward helps you stay motivated to reach your goals.\n\n*   Write 500 words and take a 10-minute break.\n*   Eat one piece of chocolate after 30 minutes of work.\n*   Reward yourself when you complete the task.\n\n**Seek Professional Help**\n\nIf your motivation remains low for two or more weeks, seek professional help. You may also want to seek help if your lack of motivation is affecting your daily functioning.\n\n*   Schedule an appointment with your physician.\n*   Consider online therapy programs to address any underlying issues and tackle your lack of motivation.

Please enter a brief description of your feedback: Submitting... *This will not be displayed publicly* The final answer is:\n\n\n**Title**\nI've Been a Victim of Fraud Twice-Here's What It Feels Like\n\n**Overview**\nFraud can shake you to your core, have you questioning everything, and provoke levels of anxiety that bordered on panic. I've experienced identity theft by someone who spent a few hundred bucks at various retailers in my name and mortgage fraud by someone trying to steal my entire down payment days before closing on my house.\n\n**The First Time: Identity Theft**\nOne day, I received a letter from Nordstrom notifying me that my application for a store credit card had been rejected. I was disappointed, but also very surprised since I never applied for the card in the first place. After conferring with my partner, we determined that I hadn't experienced any major dissociative states lately, so I was left with one inevitable conclusion: fraud.\n\n*   Within days, I received bills for new shoes from Macy's and some electronics from Best Buy.\n*   Seeing my name on a financial statement that did not belong to me was uniquely disorienting.\n*   The knowledge that my private information was out there for anyone to use, and the fear of what could come next, made me feel exposed and vulnerable.\n\n**The Second Time: Mortgage Fraud**\nMy experience with identity theft was stressful, but the second time it wasn't just about the cost of some shoes and a hit to my credit at stake. It was about the bulk of the savings my partner and I had been stashing for years.\n\n*   When trying to buy a house, beware of wire fraud.\n*   Someone hacked the email of either my lawyer or the title agency, or both, and spoofed it down to the font on the signatures.\n*   If you're like me, think \"Oh, I am too smart for that\" but in reality, even the smartest people fall for scams.\n\n**The Aftermath**\nIt's hard to describe the relief when you realize that you have dodged a major financial screw-up. But there are also intense feelings of vulnerability, fear, and shame.\n\n*   Even as I write this, I wonder who out there has my information and is working their way down a list of other potential victims until I am once again the target of the latest scam, hack, or fraud.\n*   It feels like there's constantly a finger hovering over a button that will steal all my money at any time. 9 Common Scams and The Tactics to Watch Out For Read More: LIVING WELL SELF-IMPROVEMENT By Nick Ingalls, MA Nick Ingalls, MA is the editorial director at Verywell Mind, managing new content production and editorial processes.

This article was written by Elizabeth Scott, PhD and reviewed by Rachel Goldman, PhD, FTOS.\n\n**5 Types of Self-Care for Every Area of Your Life**\n\n**Why Is Self-Care Important?**\n\nSelf-care is a conscious act people take to promote their physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional health. It is vital for building resilience toward life's stressors that we can't eliminate.\n\nWhen you've taken steps to care for your mind and body, you'll be better equipped to live your best life. Unfortunately, however, many of us view self-care as a luxury rather than a priority. Consequently, we're left feeling overwhelmed, tired, and ill-equipped to handle life's inevitable challenges.\n\n\n**Physical Self-Care**\n\nWe need to take care of our bodies if we want them to run efficiently. Remember that there's a strong connection between our body and our mind. When we care for our bodies, we'll think and feel better, too.\n\nPhysical self-care includes fueling your body, getting enough sleep, doing enough physical activity, and caring for your physical needs. Attending healthcare appointments, taking medication as prescribed, and managing your health are all part of good physical self-care.\n\n\n*   Are you getting adequate sleep?\n*   Is your diet fueling your body well?\n*   Are you taking charge of your health?\n*   Are you getting enough exercise?\n\n\n**Social Self-Care**\n\nSocialization is key to self-care. But, often, it's hard to make time for friends, and it can be easy to neglect our relationships when life gets busy.\n\nClose connections are important to your well-being. The best way to cultivate and maintain close relationships is to put time and energy into building our relationships with others.\n\n\n*   Are you getting enough face-to-face time with your friends?\n*   What are you doing to nurture your relationships with friends and family?\n\n\n**Mental Self-Care**\n\nThe way we think and the things that we're filling our minds with greatly influence our psychological well-being.\n\nMental self-care includes doing things that keep your mind sharp, like puzzles or learning about a subject that fascinates you. You might find reading books or watching inspiring movies fuel your mind.\n\n\n*   Are you making enough time for activities that mentally stimulate you?\n*   Are you doing proactive things to help you stay mentally healthy?\n\n\n**Spiritual Self-Care**\n\nResearch shows that a lifestyle including religion or spirituality is generally a healthier lifestyle.\n\nNurturing your spirit, however, doesn't have to involve religion. It can involve anything that helps you develop a deeper sense of meaning, understanding, or connection with the universe.\n\n\n*   What questions do you ask yourself about your life and experience?\n*   Are you engaging in spiritual practices that you find fulfilling?\n\n\n**Emotional Self-Care**\n\nIt's essential to have healthy coping skills to deal with uncomfortable emotions, like anger, anxiety, and sadness.\n\nEmotional self-care may include activities that help us acknowledge and express our feelings regularly and safely.\n\n\n*   Do you have healthy ways to process your emotions?\n*   Do you incorporate activities into your life that help you feel recharged?\n\n\n**Why Is Self-Care Important?**\n\nHaving an effective self-care routine has been shown to have a number of important health benefits. Some of these include:\n\n\n*   Reducing anxiety and depression\n*   Reducing stress and improving resilience\n*   Improving happiness\n*   Increasing energy\n*   Reducing burnout\n*   Stronger interpersonal relationships\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), self-care is essential because it can help promote health, prevent disease, and aid people in better coping with illness.\n\n\n**Develop Your Self-Care Plan**\n\nAn effective self-care plan should be tailored to your life and your needs. It needs to be something created by you, for you.\n\nCustomizing your own self-care plan can act as a preventative measure to make sure that you don't get overwhelmed, overstressed, and burned out.\n\n\n1. Assess your needs: Make a list of the different parts of your life and major activities that you engage in each day.\n2. Consider your stressors: Think about the aspects of these areas that cause stress and consider some ways you might address that stress.\n3. Devise self-care strategies: Think about some activities that you can do that will help you feel better in each of these areas of your life.\n4. Plan for challenges: When you discover that you're neglecting a certain aspect of your life, create a plan for change.\n5. Take small steps: You don't have to tackle everything all at once.\n6. Schedule time to focus on your needs: Even when you feel like you don't have time to squeeze in one more thing, make self-care a priority.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can develop an effective self-care plan that meets your unique needs and helps you maintain overall well-being.

It isn't uncommon to hear everyone from your boss to celebrities herald their morning routines as a reason they're successful. Though drinking hot lemon water, exercising, and meditation are the typical morning go-tos, we became interested in hearing more about the uncommon routines people do in those precious first ten minutes of the morning.\n\nWe talked to five different people with widely varying occupations, ranging from a writer to massage therapist to professional skateboarder... Some of their morning rituals were unique twists on tried-and-true go-tos, while others were ones we had never considered. Read on to get some inspiration on how to revamp your mornings.\n\n**You Can Talk to Your Pets**\n\nJoey*, a writer we talked to, shared that their morning routine is simple: They drink coffee and talk to their cats.\n\nI think that because I spend a lot of my day on my computer looking at the screen for writing and stuff, it's lovely to start my day interacting with these sweet furry creatures, they explained. Watching them play while Joey drinks coffee isn't only a respite from the inevitable screentime Joey faces-they also named an element of humor they find particularly uplifting.\n\nThey make me laugh. Cats are very funny, so there's also something grounding about enjoying the humor of it all. This sweet morning ritual isn't just a cute moment they share with their pets. Laughter is actually proven to lower cortisol levels, too.1\n\n**You Can Embrace a Spiritual Interest**\n\nLily is a creative director and astrologer. When it comes to prepping for her day during the week, she relies on classic methods like drinking hot lemon water and going for a long walk with her dog. However, she digs into a different routine on the weekends.\n\nI usually like to start my leisurely days with a spiritual mental component, she shares. She'll light a candle, pull a tarot card, and journal. Then, her final step is to review the day's astrological aspects. It feels great to start my day like this because there is a depth to it that I really love, she continued.\n\nIt's important to note that Lily uses astrology as a supportive tool to understand how she might experience the day, but she doesn't use it as an end-all be-all oracle. The point is to use it as a tool for self-reflection and consideration of what's to come. Using astrology to try to predict the future or relying on astrological aspects as definitive information can increase stress. As with all things, moderation is key.2\n\n**You Can Sit in Complete Silence**\n\nLeeann is a massage therapist. This means her job isn't only physically demanding, it can be emotionally taxing too. That's why she observes a period of complete silence in the morning.\n\nShe's not meditating, reading, drinking coffee-she is just still. This practice was prompted by her partner's needs. Her partner, who is also a massage therapist, wakes up and cleans their entire home. It helps her start the day with a clean slate. She also prefers quiet while she cleans.\n\nThis led Leann to quietly be with herself in the mornings, and she realized it is the perfect dynamic for them and the perfect practice for her. Being in a client-based business, you're constantly chatting. I have to adjust myself to other people's tone and that can be exhausting, she shared.\n\nHer quiet mornings refill her cup so she seldom feels depleted at the end of the day.\n\n**You Can Look Out the Window and Get Some Sun**\n\nThis next one is for those who don't fancy themselves morning people. It is well known that getting some sun in the morning can increase melatonin production and make for much better sleep in the evening. Some people hold to this and make sure they get outside every single morning.\n\nBut there is another set of people who would love to go for a morning walk but can't seem to get out of bed early enough to do so. If you fall into that category, then this suggestion is for you. Mike, a retired professional skateboarder, isn't a morning person. He lives in a condo, so he doesn't have a backyard he can walk out into to get the sun in his eyes.\n\nInstead, he brushes his teeth, drinks a large glass of water, and stands in the sun by the brightest window. By staring into the light, he finds himself getting more energy. Sure, going outside and getting light with no interference from the window is probably ideal, but let's call this the next best thing.3 Also, we should clarify that the benefit of sunlight on your eyes does not mean looking directly at the sun, which can blind you.\n\n**You Can Take Some Time to Be Creative**\n\nKatie, a writer and producer, is doing all the right things in the morning: Meditation, water, and exercise. She also dedicates one to two hours of her mornings to writing. While some may focus on journaling and gratitude lists, Katie focuses on her creative projects, like a feature film she's penning.\n\nI feel like I get a little dopamine boost, explains Katie as she speaks about why she loves writing in the morning. It makes me much happier because I've carved out time for my creative work, she continued.\n\n**How to Take Your Mornings to the Next Level**\n\nEvery person we interviewed had this one thing in common: They all found a unique way to meet a key personal need. Joey noticed the screen fatigue setting in and opted for some early morning laughter, courtesy of their cats. Lily prefers an introspective and spiritual approach to her days, so she draws the astrology chart for the day.\n\nLeanna is still recharging from her clients from the day before, so silence, without the pressure of meditation, is key. Not a morning person? Mike found a solution. Katie made the stereotypical practice of writing in the morning all her own.\n\nTo level up your mornings, tap into what you feel the most depleted by at the end of the day. Maybe it is socializing, or not having time for a creative project, or not being able to sleep. Whatever it is, see how you can counteract that with one simple act you do first thing in the morning.\n\nUse that as the foundation for your new and improved morning routine.\n\n*All names have been changed*\n\nRead More: LIVING WELL SELF-IMPROVEMENT\n\n3 Sources\n\nBy Julia Childs Heyl, MSW\n\nJulia Childs Heyl, MSW, is a clinical social worker and writer.

Keep that in mind as you peruse this list! You Are Enough Just as You Are-but It's OK To Seek Self-Improvement Too Read More: LIVING WELL SELF-IMPROVEMENT See Our Editorial Process Meet Our Review Board Share Feedback & Report a Concern 33 Reddit-Approved Tips for Self-Improvement and Better Mental Health Vetted by the experts By Team Verywell Mind Published on April 10, 2025 d3sign Getty Images Consider these common scenarios: You've been trying to build healthier habits but can't seem to make anything stick. You keep hearing about all the benefits of meditation but you're really not sure if it's working. Your friend keeps canceling plans and you're starting to wonder if you should end the friendship. What do they all have in common? They're probably things you'd ask about on Reddit. Medically reviewed publications like Verywell Mind and others can be massively helpful during times of need, but so often what we really crave during our late-night-panic-googling session is personal experience. While we certainly don't recommend Reddit as your sole source of wellness advice, it can help to get some additional crowd-sourced perspective from real people. Thus, we scoured some of the most popular mental health-centric subreddits-such as r selfimprovement, r mentalhealth, and r motivation-to bring you this list of oft-repeated wellness tips, tricks, and pearls of wisdom that struck the biggest chord among Redditors. Mindset & Self-Perception Advice like the following encouraged folks dealing with negativity or self-esteem issues to keep things in the proper perspective: No one thinks about you nearly as much as you think about yourself. Ask yourself, What would someone who truly loved themselves do right now? It's okay if growth takes time-the time will pass either way. If you can't beat the fear, just do it scared. Treat yourself with patience and kindness. Avoid negative self-talk, and speak to yourself like someone you care about. Remember, your toughest critic is you. So give yourself some grace. Never evaluate your life when you're tired. Remember you're more than you give yourself credit for. Discipline & Personal Growth Redditors in search of motivation found these tips to be some of the best ways to stay on the path of self-improvement: Get disciplined with at least one key thing in your life and stay consistent with it. This practice of discipline in one area will carry over to other areas of your life. Cultivate a mindset of lifelong learning. Motivation comes and goes but discipline keeps you moving. Keep showing up, even when you don't feel like it. If it's worth doing, it's worth doing it badly. If you can't handle doing it perfectly or finish it, half-ass it at least. If you stop using a skill, you lose it-whether it's physical strength, knowledge, social skills, or anything else. Pay attention to how you're moving through life and try to be mindful of all that you do. Physical & Mental Well-being While these might seem like obvious pieces of advice that you've heard a million times before-whether on Reddit or IRL-there's good reason for that; they actually work. Get at least 8 hours of sleep a night as often as possible. Exercise. Exercise is the foundation of almost every other good habit. Eat breakfast-seriously. A combination of daily movement and sunshine (vitamin D) does wonders. Relax your jaw, drop your shoulders, close your eyes, and take a few long, deep breaths. Feel like everyone hates you? You're probably tired. Feel like you hate everyone? You're probably hungry.", "category": "general"},

Trick Your Brain with Tiny Steps\n2. Blast Your Hype Playlist\n3. Count Down Like You're About to Dance\n4. Ditch the To-Do List for a Calendar\n5. Use Music Like a Task Timer\n6. Rate Tasks by Intensity, Not Importance\n7. Move First, Think Later\n8. Narrate Your Day Like a Sports Commentator\n9. Celebrate Every Micro-Win\n\nIf you've ever found yourself swearing you'll start that task right after this one video (or snack, or scroll), you're not alone-and you're definitely not lazy. Sometimes, the best way to jumpstart productivity is to lean into unconventional (even silly-sounding) strategies that actually work with your brain instead of fighting against it.\n\nHere, we're sharing productivity tips that might make you raise an eyebrow-but mental health experts, coaches, and real-life humans say they work wonders.\n\n**1. Trick Your Brain with Tiny Steps**\n\nTherapist Risa Williams, LMFT, author of The Procrastination Playbook, swears by this sneaky psychological trick: make the first step laughably small. Make it sound so easy that your brain has trouble resisting doing it, says Williams.\n\nInstead of telling yourself you have to write a chapter, tell yourself all you have to do is open the document and type the title.\n\n*   - RISA WILLIAMS, LMFT\n*   And that's it. Seriously.\n*   Then you close the laptop.\n*   Oddly enough, most of us end up doing more than we planned-because getting started is the hardest part.\n*   Williams calls this the Ridiculously Easy First Step technique, and it's magic for overcoming the pressure of perfectionism.\n\n**2. Blast Your Hype Playlist**\n\nYou know that one song that makes you instantly dance like no one's watching? That's the energy we're looking for here. Sam Dylan Finch, a neuro-affirming peer support coach with AuDHD, calls this their Hype Playlist strategy-and it's not just about playing bops.\n\nThey need to be songs that, if you heard them at a wedding, you'd be dashing to the dance floor instinctually, Finch explains.\n\n*   It's nostalgic, upbeat music that literally gets you into your body and moves you.\n*   According to Finch, the combination of music and nostalgia engages our reward processing system and supports emotional regulation.1\n*   Finch recommends playing your hype playlist the moment you catch yourself stuck in a distraction loop-whether you're doomscrolling or procrastinating on basic self-care.\n*   By letting the music jolt you into movement, you're leveraging dopamine and body awareness to support emotional regulation and task-switching.\n*   Finch's own playlist includes songs like Cotton Eye Joe and the Pok√©mon theme.\n\n**3. Count Down Like You're About to Dance**\n\nFeeling paralyzed before starting something? Say it with us: 5, 6-5, 6, 7, 8!\n\nThis one pairs well with your Hype Playlist. Finch encourages clients to use verbal cues like 3, 2, 1-LET'S GO! or dance-style countdowns.\n\n*   Add a physical motion-stand up, clap, shake out your arms-and suddenly you're in motion.\n*   This tip is similar to the five-second rule for procrastination, popularized by Mel Robbins.\n*   You count down from five, and then you do the thing.\n*   This is what's called an 'interstitial action,' Finch explains.\n*   We're physically signaling to ourselves that we're ending the previous activity and moving on to something else.\n\n**4. Ditch the To-Do List for a Calendar**\n\nFor the past few years, I've been following a planning method called Power Planning. It was designed by Sam Laura Brown, a perfectionism coach who runs a podcast called The Perfectionism Project.\n\nInstead of working straight from a to-do list, I take an hour a week to schedule all my tasks into my Google calendar.\n\n*   If plans change, I can always tweak my calendar to adjust to the new plan.\n*   It's kinda like time blocking-but better.\n*   This helps because:\n    *   It's realistic. When you have to fit everything into a calendar, you have to be more realistic about your time.\n    *   This means you're less likely to overload yourself with work.\n    *   It eliminates decision fatigue.\n    *   I don't have to stare at my to-do list and figure out what to do first-instead, I consult my plan and work on that.\n    *   It's adaptable. Power Planning is built to be flexible.\n\n**5. Use Music Like a Task Timer**\n\nIf you can dance your way through a task, why not soundtrack your productivity? Williams recommends using a task playlist -one or two upbeat songs-to give yourself a set amount of time to clean, sort paperwork, or power through emails.\n\n*   We can use this for tasks and chores we need to do, she says.\n*   Pick a playlist that gets the energy going... it can feel more fun than just using a timer.\n*   It's different to a Hype Playlist, as you're using the task playlist as a timer and not just a general feel-good playlist.\n\n**6. Rate Tasks by Intensity, Not Importance**\n\nSometimes it's not about time management-it's stress management. Williams suggests breaking a task into smaller steps and rating them by intensity -a tool she details in her book, Get Stuff Done Without the Stress.\n\n*   This pairs well with the Ridiculously Easy First Step, but takes it further.\n*   You can rate tasks or pieces of the task in this way, she says, and then tackle the low-intensity parts first.\n*   This way, you start with the parts that feel easiest, giving you a win and some momentum before you face the hard stuff.\n\n**7. Move First, Think Later**\n\nOverthinking often sabotages productivity. Instead, try using your body to lead the way. This one's backed by Finch's movement-based interstitial action trick-but it's also a strategy many neurodivergent folks use instinctively.\n\n*   Need to write an email? Walk in a circle first.\n*   Need to fold laundry? Do one stretch or body shake.\n*   It sounds silly. But if you try it, you might be surprised at how just moving disrupts the I'm stuck loop.\n\n**8. Narrate Your Day Like a Sports Commentator**\n\nOkay, bear with us. If you live alone-or don't mind sounding weird-try narrating your actions aloud.\n\n*   This might sound wild, but I narrate my tasks like I'm on a cooking show: 'OK, we're going to rinse the mug now... excellent technique!'\n*   I feel less like I'm doing chores and more like I'm starring in a cozy reality show.\n*", "category": "general"},

Whether caused by a disagreement in values or simple miscommunication, we all encounter conflict at some point in our lives. Unfortunately, when conflict is not addressed productively, it can escalate, sometimes to the point of violence.1 Emotions are contagious. When we encounter someone who is experiencing stress, we pick up on their stress.2 The same is true for other emotions, including anger, which is why we might feed off of someone else's anger, causing a conflict to escalate further. In the workplace, unresolved conflict leads to less creativity and productivity,3 and interpersonal relationship conflict can destroy relationships, including friendships and marriages. It is essential to build and use healthy, appropriate skills to de-escalate conflicts in a healthy way.\n\n**6 De-Escalation Techniques to Diffuse Conflict**\n\nConflict and disagreement are a part of life, albeit often an unpleasant one. Whether caused by a disagreement in values or simple miscommunication, we all encounter conflict at some point in our lives. Unfortunately, when conflict is not addressed productively, it can escalate, sometimes to the point of violence.\n\n1. Address the Conflict ASAP\n2. Identify the Goal of De-Escalation\n3. Remain Calm and Regulated\n4. Practice Active Listening and Take Turns\n5. Engage With a Third Party\n6. Compromise\n\n**Address the Conflict ASAP**\n\nThe sooner you address a conflict, the better. As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Conflict can grow over time, and you can become resentful of an ongoing issue.\n\n*   Bring the conflict to the other person's attention and find a resolution early on to prevent escalation before it begins.\n*   Overcoming resentment in relationships\n*   Addressing long-term conflicts\n\n**Identify the Goal of De-Escalation**\n\nSometimes we know something is wrong but struggle to articulate exactly what the issue is or our desired outcome. How can you resolve something if you do not know what that looks like? Understand each person's perception of the problem and desired resolution beforehand.\n\n*   Ask yourself, \"How will I know that this is resolved?\"\n*   What change would make things right for you?\n*   Do you need to see a specific behavior change?\n*   Do you feel wronged and need an apology?\n\n**Remain Calm and Regulated**\n\nThe longer a conflict has gone on, the bigger your feelings about it and the other person are likely to be. While your feelings are valid, they can interfere with your ability to communicate and address the conflict in a productive way.\n\n*   Make sure you are in a calm headspace when addressing a conflict.\n*   It is possible for big feelings to come up during the conversation, so be aware of this possibility, and use coping skills as needed to regulate yourself.\n*   Sometimes a conflict is complex and needs long-term work in finding a solution.\n\n**Practice Active Listening and Take Turns**\n\nOften, each person has a different perception of the conflict and what resolution is needed. It can be tempting to cling to our perception of what is going on and not address the other person's side.\n\n*   Make sure that both sides have the opportunity to speak their truth.\n*   Actively listen when the other person is sharing.\n*   When expressing your side of the conflict, use neutral language and I statements to reduce the risk of further escalation.\n\n**Engage With a Third Party**\n\nA neutral third party or mediator can aid in conflict resolution. Since they are not directly involved in the conflict itself, they do not have an emotional investment in the outcome.\n\n*   A mediator can help both parties see an acceptable resolution.\n*   If your conflict is in a relationship, a mental health professional may be able to provide resolution support through couples therapy.\n*   If your conflict is with a colleague, your workplace may employ trained mediators to help you come to an appropriate resolution.\n\n**Compromise**\n\nAs noted above, it is tempting to get caught up in our perception of a conflict and vision of an appropriate resolution, forgetting that there is another side to the story.\n\n*   Recognize your values as well as what you might be able to bend in order to come to a solution that is mutually agreeable.\n*   The other party's needs might align more closely with yours than you think.\n*   When you are open to compromise, you can more easily find an appropriate resolution to your conflict.\n\n**Resources That Can Help You Deal With Conflict**\n\nSometimes, you might need outside help to manage or de-escalate a conflict. Even if you take steps to diffuse the situation, the other party might not be receptive or may choose to continue to escalate regardless of your efforts.\n\n*   Workplace conflict: Consult your job's human resources department.\n*   Conflict with your partner: If you and your partner are struggling with conflict, a couples therapist can help you work through it.\n*   Divorce: Sometimes, the safest or healthiest option in a marriage is to end the relationship.

This can be due to physical and emotional insecurities that a person may have. While it may seem harmless, it's an unhealthy way to deal with insecurities and can cause strain on your relationships with family, friends, and even strangers.\n\n[2] Personality disorders such as Narcissistic personality disorder, Borderline personality disorder, and Histrionic personality disorder could also be the cause of attention-seeking behavior. Some people may exhibit extreme emotional reactions due to these disorders.\n\n[3] Other mental health conditions like ADHD, anxiety, and bipolar disorder can also lead to a person displaying attention-seeking behaviors.\n\nThe first step to stopping needing attention is recognizing that you display attention-seeking behaviors. It's essential to work on building self-confidence and ridding yourself of insecurities to overcome this issue. This can be achieved by going to therapy, keeping a journal, or building your self-esteem through daily positive affirmations and surrounding yourself with supportive people.\n\nIf you have a friend or loved one who constantly needs attention, you can help them become aware of their behavior by setting boundaries, communicating with them, being understanding, and asking for professional help if necessary.

[7] Some people who need attention don't realize that they're exhibiting attention-seeking behaviors. Attention-seeking people express their desire for attention in varying ways. These signs include faking helplessness, causing conflict, constantly looking for sympathy from others, needing to be complimented, and lying and embellishing stories.  [8] The first step to stop needing attention is recognizing that you display attention-seeking behaviors. Working on building self-confidence and ridding yourself of insecurities is a significant first step to helping you stop craving attention. Here are some ways you can build confidence:   -   Go to therapy: Speaking to a professional is the best way to deal with insecurities and build confidence.\n    -   Keep a journal: Becoming more self-aware of your attention-seeking behavior goes a long way in helping you get over them. Keeping a daily journal can help you achieve more self-awareness when you track your behaviors.\n    -   Build your self-esteem: For many people, the need to always be the center of attention stems from low self-esteem. However, attention-seeking behaviors do nothing to help you build healthy self-esteem. Using daily positive affirmations and surrounding yourself with genuinely supportive people is a great place to start.\n\n- **How to Deal With a Person Who Constantly Needs Attention**\n  *   Set boundaries: Indulging the whims of a person who continually seeks attention only fuels their need for attention.\n  *   Communicate with them: Sometimes, a person seeking attention might not know they are acting in a way that draws attention. Take them aside and gently communicate any issues you're noticing.\n  *   Be understanding: Attention-seekers often act out for a deeper reason than simply needing attention. They may have an underlying mental health disorder or have self-esteem or image problems.\n\n- **References**\n  *   https://www.healthline.com/health/personality-disorders\n  *   https://www.healthline.com/health/narcissistic-personality-disorder-symptoms-traits\n  *   https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety-disorders-and-treatment\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n*   Signs\n    - Faking helplessness\n    - Causing conflict\n    - Constantly looking for sympathy from others\n    - Needing to be complimented\n    - Lying and embellishing stories\n*   Causes\n  1.

{"title": "I Tried Junk Journaling For a Month-Here's What Happened", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/i-tried-junk-journaling-for-a-month-11679873", "content": "Last Modified on February 20, 2025\n\n**I Tried Junk Journaling For a Month-Here's What Happened**\n\nIf you hate traditional journaling, here's an alternative that may work for you\n\nBy Noma Nazish Updated on February 20, 2025\nNoma Nazish Verywell Mind Table of Contents\n\nMy Weekly Junk Journaling Experience\n\nWhy Junk Journaling Works\n\nShould You Try Junk Journaling?\n\nAlternatives to Junk Journaling\n\nI must admit I never gave much thought to the odd bits of everyday junk like receipts, coupons, flyers, stamps, or product tags before tossing them in the trash. That is until I stumbled upon the latest self-care trend sweeping social media: junk journaling.\n\nJunk journaling might sound like an oxymoron, but that's what sets it apart. Instead of being a place to organize your thoughts or to-do list, it's a place to organize all your (you guessed it) junk. Think of it as the less structured, more laidback cousin of traditional journaling and scrapbooking.\n\nPart of the fun is that there are no rules. And in a world that constantly demands productivity, perfection, and constant engagement, this freeform practice might just be the respite our mental health needs.\n\nGiven the promising stress-busting benefits and practically no barrier to entry, the self-care nerd in me naturally had to try it out. Ahead, find out how the process went for me and whether or not the hype rang true.\n\nPsychologists Swear This One Thing Can Help Cure Your Chronic Stress\n\nMy Weekly Junk Journaling Experience\nTo stay as close to the theme as possible, I decided to create my own notebook for this experiment by repurposing discarded scraps. You can see a couple pages from my journal at the top of this article. I used an old wedding card to make the notebook cover and cut and stapled old newspaper sheets, paper bags, and leftover wrapping paper to make the pages. Pretty cool, right?\n\nHere's how it went from there:\n\n1.  Week 1: Getting started felt the hardest despite my excitement about trying something new.\n2.  Week 2: Now that I didn't set any expectations for the weekly spread, the ideas came more naturally.\n3.  Week 3: I turned to more unusual scraps like withered leaves from the backyard and ended up with a cutesy nature-themed collage.\n4.  Week 4: By this time, I also noticed I felt more present when doing even ordinary things like eating a snack or putting away groceries.\n\nWhy Junk Journaling Works\n\nAfter noticing all the positive effects, I wondered-is there actual science behind this? To find out, I tapped experts to get the scoop on how creative outlets like junk journaling can improve our mental well-being. Here's what they shared:\n\n1.  It May Lower Stress And Anxiety: There is something incredibly freeing about not worrying if your handwriting is neat or your thoughts make sense.\n2.  It Promotes Mindfulness: The tactile, creative process of picking, cutting, and pasting different materials encourages mindfulness, grounding you in the present moment.\n3.  It Helps Cultivate Gratitude And Joy: Junk journaling invites you to find meaning in seemingly insignificant items.\n\nShould You Try Junk Journaling?\n\nSince junk journaling focuses on creative self-expression rather than skill, it's suitable for people of all ages and artistic abilities, says Barton. It's particularly helpful for those who struggle with perfectionism as it promotes free and non-judgmental creative exploration, she adds. It's also beneficial for anyone dealing with grief or trauma as it provides a safe space to explore and process difficult emotions that may be hard to put into words.\n\nAlternatives to Junk Journaling\n\nIf junk journaling is not quite your thing, no worries! Several alternative activities offer comparable mental health benefits. For example:\n\n*   Coloring\n*   Bullet Journaling\n*   Collage Making\n*   Clay Modeling\n*   Diamond Art\n*   Gardening\n*   Knitting\n*   Crocheting\n*   Zentangling\n\nThe key is to choose a creative outlet that feels natural and enjoyable to you-one that gives your brain a break while also helping you express yourself, says Anderson.\n\nTakeaway\n\nWill I keep junk journaling after this month-long experiment? Absolutely. It may have started as a curious dip into a TikTok trend, but I can see junk journaling as a fun addition to my self-care toolkit-one that has helped me slow down, be more present, and more grateful for life's little moments.\n\nAm I suggesting everyone should start junk journaling, though? Not necessarily. Self-care is like Cinderella's shoe, one size doesn't fit all. Like the experts said, choose what resonates with you the most.

{"title": "I Swapped My Afternoon Coffee for Greens Powder-Here's What It Did for My Energy", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/can-a-greens-powder-boost-your-energy-11708109", "content": "on This Article **The Greens Powder Experiment**\n\nA greens powder can help balance out a vitamin deficiency, but can it boost your energy? bee32 Getty Images\n\n**What's in a Greens Powder, Anyway?**\n\nWhen I think of a green vegetable-based drink, I imagine a bunch of random leafy foods blended together into a dark green sludge that is very nutritious-if you can stomach it. Like something Rocky Balboa would drink after downing some raw eggs for breakfast.\n\nThankfully, a greens powder drink is not that. The powder I tested was extremely tasty-so what's in it? The greens powder blend contains the following ingredients, all organic:\n\n1. Barley grass\n2. Kale\n3. Alfalfa\n4. Wheatgrass\n5. Oat grass\n6. Lemon juice\n7. Chlorella\n8. Astragalus\n\nIt may read like a list of things you wouldn't want to drink, but the final product tasted good. I do feel compelled to note that, as far as I can tell, this wild strawberry kiwi powder contains neither strawberry nor kiwi. The combination of additional ingredients like pomegranate juice, monk fruit extract, and other natural flavors did the trick, however, without sugar or artificial sweeteners like aspartame.\n\nFinally, this powder is labeled as gluten-free, vegan-friendly, and non-GMO. If you're looking to try a greens powder, you should always read the label, says Eliza Savage, MS, RD, CDN.\n\nShe stresses the importance of confirming the following:\n\n1. That you recognize what all the ingredients are\n2. That you aren't ingesting something that may interact with medications you're taking (especially if the product contains herbs or botanicals)\n3. That the product is third-party tested or has a trusted certification such as NSF, USP, or Informed-Choice\n4. That additional ingredients, such as probiotics or digestive enzymes, are not duplicative with other supplements you may already be taking\n\nBe sure that you know exactly what is in your product.\n\n*   ELIZA SAVAGE, MS, RD, CDN\n\n**Greens Powder Benefits**\n\nThe goal of my experiment was to help boost my energy, so while I'm focusing on that, I will mention that this and many greens powders also purport to help with things like gut health and immune support. As with all supplements, any statements regarding the potential benefits of this greens powder have not been evaluated or approved by the FDA.\n\nIt's essential to talk to your doctor before incorporating any supplement into your diet.\n\nOn the nutrient front, the powder boasts hefty servings of vitamin C (100% of the recommended daily value), vitamin D (100% DV), and vitamin B12 (420% DV).\n\nWhile it is generally preferable to get your nutrients through food rather than supplementation, we all know that's not always possible. A lot of research has investigated the impact of deficiency in these vitamins, and how supplementation or increasing your intake can help:\n\n1.  Research suggests that a moderate deficiency in vitamin C, found in citrus and other foods, can lead to an increased risk of physical fatigue as well as a higher risk of poorer mental health outcomes.\n2.  B vitamins, including B12, help your body convert food into energy, and are often connected to brain function. B vitamin deficiencies can potentially lead to impaired memory, mood changes, and cognitive issues.\n3.  Research supports the fact that vitamins like B12, C, and D can indirectly impact energy levels and fatigue, says Savage.\n\nIf you have a deficiency in one of these nutrients, you may feel tired, as each is involved in energy metabolism and creation.\n\n**Should You Try It?**\n\nIf you work a 9 to 5 job-especially one that doesn't have you moving around much-you may be resigned to facing an afternoon slump day after day. But it doesn't have to be that way! If you think you might benefit from the same kind of boost I was aiming for without loading up on caffeine and sugar, a greens powder is worth a shot-as long as your doctor gives you the OK.\n\nIf you aren't already loading up on vitamin supplements, this should be a safe option. Savage reminds us that the effects are far from guaranteed. If you aren't already deficient in these nutrients, you may not notice the 'boost,' she says.\n\nI always recommend working with a healthcare practitioner to determine if you have a deficiency, and if so, how to best treat it.\n\nAs for cost-this particular powder costs about $60 for a 30-serving bag. At $2 per serving, it's more expensive than a home-brewed cup of coffee but cheaper than the average Dunkin' or Starbucks coffee, so it won't break the bank if you typically rely on the latter for your afternoon energy fix.\n\n**Alternative Options**\n\nIn general, Savage urges caution with the many supplements on the market that tout energy-boosting benefits. I recommend steering clear, she says. Instead, opt for something that contains caffeine, like a cup of coffee or a kombucha, which can give you a boost.\n\nIf that causes you jitters, maybe matcha. Don't neglect the other quick (and free!) midday energy boosters that are available to you as well.\n\nA quick walk outside your home or your workplace-or really any form of body movement-can do wonders to reinvigorate you. Additionally, many times people feel fatigue when they are actually dehydrated, Savage says. Grab a glass of water and drink up. You'll feel more energized instantly-or you'll at least have to take a walk to the bathroom that will get your energy up and at 'em!\n\nSo whatever kind of midday slump you may be dealing with, there are plenty of options out there to help give you the boost you need to get through the day upright.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\nAs someone who tends to be a skeptic of anything in the realm of natural remedies, I wouldn't be calling my greens powder test a success if I hadn't experienced some tangible benefits. If you're looking for an entry point into the world of vitamin supplementation, I'd recommend this option based on my experience.\n\nBut given the evidence, I'll also take a look at my diet to see if I might be vitamin-deficient. Think of a greens powder like a Band-Aid, Savage says. It may cover your nutritional bases for a bit, but it will not replace the need to eat your fruits and vegetables.\n\nCommit to getting enough sleep, water, and a healthy, balanced diet.

{"title": "8 Common Conversation Mistakes You Don't Know You're Making", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/common-conversation-mistakes-11699413", "content": "or Suggest an Article Leave a comment\n\n**8 Common Conversation Mistakes You Don't Know You're Making**\n\n**You might be hurting your relationships without realizing it**\n\nBy Ariane Resnick, CNC Published on March 26, 2025 FG Trade Latin Getty Images\n\n**Impact of Conversation Mistakes**\n\nBefore delving into the specific mistakes we might be making, let's get clear about why this subject even matters. As you might suspect, our conversations impact our relationships, and can do so positively or negatively depending on how they go.\n\n*   Our conversations mark the difference between healthy, stable relationships and those that might not survive long-term.\n*   They could even end our relationships.\n*   Over time, these mistakes can contribute to people feeling misunderstood, and others may eventually avoid conversations altogether.\n\n**Common Mistakes in Conversations**\n\nHere are the most common mistakes we might make regardless of our communication style.\n\n1.  **Boomerasking**: Have you ever asked a question just to have the opportunity to answer it yourself? This faux pas isn't just unkind; boomerasking can make us seem manipulative since we're only bringing up a topic for someone else to discuss before we do.\n2.  **Interrupting**: It can be challenging to stay silent when you have something to say. There are some relationships in which both parties are interrupters who don't mind when it happens, but that's more the exception than the norm.\n3.  **Talking Too Much About Oneself**: We've all heard the stories-or experienced them firsthand-about bad dates where the other party won't stop droning on about their own life.\n4.  **Excessive Advice**: When a friend or loved one comes to us with a problem, it's natural to want to help them fix it-but they may just want to vent.\n5.  **Asking Closed-Ended Questions**: Asking questions is vital to a good conversation, but we want to ensure that those questions pave the way rather than create stop signs.\n6.  **Not Asking Follow-Up Questions**: When we hear a person's response to our question, it should naturally lead us to want to know something more about at least one element of what they've said.\n7.  **Interrogation**: We've discussed that a conversation should be a back-and-forth exchange, so bombarding a person with nonstop questions is something to avoid.\n8.  **Using Dismissive Language**: The biggest mistake one can make is essentially lacking respect for the other person when having a conversation.\n\n**Strategies to Avoid Conversation Mistakes**\n\nThankfully, we can get past these mistakes to start having better and more functional discussions.\n\n*   To avoid any and all of the above mistakes is simple: to listen openly and behave respectfully.\n*   We should listen with curiosity and acknowledge what the person has said. Help them unfold their thoughts instead of imposing your own.\n*   Active listening is considered a basic key to better communication.\n*   Giving a brief synopsis of what the other person said can help you correct any potential errors quickly and prevent misunderstandings.\n*   Avoid conflict by using affirming language and operating from a place of curiosity. Ask follow-up questions and if you disagree use neutral language instead of hostility.\n\n**Promoting Healthy and Balanced Conversations**\n\nWe can avoid these mistakes by being more present in our conversations.\n\n*   When we behave respectfully and genuinely want to know more about someone else's experience, it's easy to avoid talking over them or speaking nonstop about ourselves.\n*   Listen with the real intent to understand, express yourself without attack or defense, and don't leap to strategies before you understand what really matters on both sides of the conversation.\n\n**If You Happen to Make One of These Mistakes**\n\nIt's not too late: You can still turn things around. For example, Caspersen says that if we find ourselves offering unsolicited advice, instead of saying Well, what you should do is.... you can instead say, So, it sounds like [this] has been happening, what's the hardest thing in that for you? What are you trying to figure out right now?\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nCommunication errors like interrogating the other party or asking only close-ended questions can wreak havoc on relationships, but we can avoid them by being present, listening actively, staying engaged, and getting more information before jumping to conclusions or assumptions.\n\n**Resources**\n\nIf you'd like to practice your conversational skills, there are worksheets you can use or videos you can watch from communication experts. Whichever method you choose, better conversations can be on the horizon for you. 50 Deep Conversation Starters for Meaningful Connections Read More: LIVING WELL RELATIONSHIPS STRENGTHENING RELATIONSHIPS\n\n**Meet Our Review Board**\n\nAriane Resnick, CNC is a mental health writer, certified nutritionist, and wellness author who advocates for accessibility and inclusivity.\n\nShare Feedback or Suggest an Article Leave a comment.

[Editorial Note: This article was edited for clarity by Recovery Daily's editorial staff.] The views expressed in this article are those of the author and may not reflect the opinions or views of Recovery Daily or its sponsors. Follow us @recoverydaily on social media to stay up-to-date on our latest content, news, and releases.\n\n**How the Serenity Prayer Can Support Your Mental Health Journey**\n\n**What Is the Sererynity Prayer?**\n\nThe Serenity Prayer is a line of wisdom that has been around for decades, frequently mentioned in pop culture, faith-based practices, and mental health spaces. According to Leah Young, LCPC, Clinical Manager at Pathlight Mood & Anxiety Center, the Serenity Prayer is a way of challenging our emotional reaction, allowing us to empower ourselves over the things we have control over, and letting go of what we don't.\n\n**Components**\n\n*   **Serenity**: Accepting things just as they are can bring contentment with our circumstances.\n*   **Courage**: Change requires courage, especially when it comes with many question marks and unknowns.\n*   **Wisdom**: Knowing what can and cannot be controlled frees up energy for what can be changed.\n\n**Historical Background**\n\nThe Serenity Prayer was written in 1932 by American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr. It has been used in tandem with mental health treatments, especially once its popularity rose in the mid-1930s to 1940s. The prayer is widely adopted in 12-step programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous.\n\n**The Serenity Prayer**\n\nGod, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference. Living one day at a time, enjoying one moment at a time. Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace. Taking, as he did, the sinful world as it is, not as I would have it. Trusting that he will make all things right if I surrender to His will; that I may be reasonably happy in this life, and supremely happy with Him forever.\n\n**Applications Beyond 12-Step Programs**\n\n1.  **Using the Serenity Prayer to Deepen Faith**: The prayer can help us connect more deeply with our faith.\n2.  **Using the Serenity Prayer for Meditation**: The prayer can aid us in scenarios separate from faith or religion.\n3.  **Using the Serenity Prayer to Accept Life Circumstances**: The prayer has been pivotal in helping individuals cope with challenging life circumstances.\n4.  **Using the Serenity Prayer to Build Trust**: The prayer can reinforce our own power and sphere of control, allowing us to build resilience in the face of obstacles.\n5.  **Using the Serenity Prayer to Seek Guidance**: The prayer can help us find courage, wisdom, and guidance from a source beyond ourselves.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Serenity Prayer can be a powerful tool on our mental health journey. When we remind ourselves of what we have the power to change, we free ourselves to focus solely on what we can change. This allows us to break free from cycles of rumination and powerlessness, thereby creating more acceptance and peace in our lives.

Fatigue and lack of sleep: That worn-out feeling you get from juggling too many things in your head can be even worse thanks to the amount of scam texts and calls we're exposed to.\n2.  Irritability: Sometimes you might see irritability as a result of that.\n3.  Fight or flight: A lot of the effects of fraud vigilance stem from the fight-or-flight response, a natural part of human behavior meant to keep us safe, being triggered for too long.\n\n**The Scams You Need to Watch Out For**\n\n*   Romance scams attempt to make someone feel as if they are in a relationship with a person in order to extort money or gifts from them.\n*   Financial scams-often using phone tools like auto dialers and automated texts-try to pretend they are your financial institution to get access to your banking information.\n*   Phishing scams involve impersonating a legitimate communication, like a text or email, that you are expecting.\n*   Employment scams prey on those who are having a difficult time finding a job in the current economic environment.\n*   Sextortion scams involve intimate images of themselves, with scammers claiming they have compromising photos of a person and that they will be released to the public if a payment isn't made or other demands aren't met.\n\n**Is There Anything We Can Do?**\n\n1.  At an individual level, Isaac says that it is a good idea to seek help from a medical professional if you or someone you love is beginning to isolate or remove themselves from social interactions due to fear that is being caused by scam tactics like fake texts and robocalls.\n2.  However, not all of the solutions are at an individual level.\n3.  Turner says he believes that it takes a societal response to reduce the severe mental health impacts that come from sustained levels of stress coming from being vigilant about possible fraud.\n\n**How to Manage the Stress**\n\n1.  Find a routine and resist the confirmation bias of social media: Isaac says one way to manage the stress that comes from these scams is to find a routine that allows your nervous system to settle.\n2.  Lean into personal connections and familiarize yourself with existing resources: Talk to a tech-savvy friend or family member, look at online resources, and use online tools to reduce your risk.\n3.  Remember to slow down and not make assumptions: Turner's additional advice is to take a pause and gather more information before making quick decisions and paying money.\n\n**References**\n\n1.

For one, I've never really enjoyed the smell of herbal tea, let alone the taste. I remember gagging as a little kid at the smell of my mom's natural cold remedy and immune-boosting red onion and apple tea whenever she would make it before bed. Also, famously, I refuse to drink tea whenever I'm feeling sick, preferring a good night's sleep, chicken broth, and over-the-counter cold and flu medicines.\n\nNevertheless, as I've matured, so have my taste buds. Over the holidays, I spent a month in the South of India, where-in addition to eating the best Indian food I've ever had-I was also introduced to the gastronomic magic that is masala chai tea. After consuming so many cups of delicious masala chai for 30 days, apart from searching for a good chai latte that even comes close to the masala chai I had in India at local caf√©s, I have also become more open to exploring other types of teas after being a certified tea-hater for so many years.\n\nSo when I got this assignment in my inbox, I said: What the heck, sure. I knew this challenge wasn't going to be easy because apart from being a coffee drinker since I was 14, and routinely drinking a minimum of eight ounces a day, having my daily cup of joe is sort of a ritual for me. Growing up in a Latine household, I was used to having my three-ounce cup of espresso, or cafecito, twice a day-once in the morning and again in the evening after dinner. Alas, I was up for the experience.\n\n**To do this experiment correctly, I tagged nutrition and holistic health experts to get their feedback on the relationship between teas and mood as well as energy.**\n\nThe Benefits of Tea Before I get into the details of my experiment, let me preface with the many benefits of tea. Depression, Anxiety, and Mood Because of its lower caffeine content, black tea can be a great way to get the mood-boosting benefits of coffee without the jitteriness and possible insomnia as a result of too much coffee, says Alicia Bigelow, ND, a naturopathic physician, holistic therapist, and Verywell Mind review board member. While teas that contain adaptogenic herbs, such as ashwagandha or rhodiola, and botanicals, like lemon balm and chamomile, can help reduce stress and promote a sense of calm, says Supatra Tovar, PsyD, RD, a clinical psychologist and registered dietitian, Rhodiola rosea tea, specifically, has been shown to have a possible antidepressant effect on humans.1 Herbal teas like lavender or passionflower, meanwhile, are excellent for relaxation without drowsiness, Dr. Tovar adds.\n\nEnergy Levels Black tea and matcha both contain caffeine, which can enhance alertness and focus, says Dr. Tovar. They also offer additional benefits not found in coffee. Matcha, in particular, is rich in L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes calmness and helps counteract caffeine's jittery effects, Dr. Tovar explains. This combination provides a smoother, more sustained energy boost without the crashes often associated with coffee.\n\n**Energy-Boosting Teas Some other teas and herbs that have energy benefits, per Dr. Tovar, include:**\n\n*   Yerba mate: This coffee alternative contains caffeine but also antioxidants and polyphenols that support brain function and mood stability.\n*   Mat√© may also have the potential to help with weight loss2 and the prevention of chronic diseases when paired with a nutrient-rich diet.3\n*   Green tea: Similar to matcha, it contains L-theanine, which improves cognitive function and reduces stress while still offering mild stimulation.\n*   Peppermint tea: Famously caffeine-free, but its refreshing properties can enhance mental clarity and reduce fatigue.\n*   Ginseng tea: An adaptogen that helps the body manage stress and sustain energy levels throughout the day.\n\n**I Tried Turmeric Lattes to Boost My Energy-Here's What Happened**\n\nDrinking Daily Cups of Tea So, how did drinking black tea daily affect my mood and energy? Here's how I felt after each day of drinking an eight-ounce cup of tea:\n\n*   Day 1: Despite sleeping in after attending a late-night concert the day before, I woke up this Tuesday morning feeling slightly sluggish. In addition to the late bedtime, I was also on my period so naturally I was feeling quite low energy.\n*   Around 11 a.m. I had my first cup of Earl Grey tea with oat milk. I felt the effects immediately, energized for most of the morning and early afternoon.\n*   Around 3 p.m. I hit a caffeine crash-or what felt like one. As a coffee drinker, hitting a midday slump is nothing out of the ordinary-which is why I'm usually grabbing my second cup of joe around this time.\n\nDay 2: I started my Wednesday around 9 a.m. with a cup of Earl Grey tea alongside breakfast. I felt pretty energized for most of the morning, but by the time I arrived at brunch with my friends at 1 p.m., I was ready for another cup of tea. I had a late evening class that day and knew I would be on campus until 8 p.m., so refilling my tank was in order.\n\n*   To experiment a little, I opted for a coconut matcha latte on the restaurant's menu.\n*   The tall, 16-ounce glass of matcha definitely gave me the energy boost I needed to make it to the end of the day.\n\nDay 3: On Thursday, I began my day bright and early at 7 a.m. I had my typical Earl Grey tea with oat milk alongside a hearty breakfast of avocado toast topped with eggs and a banana on the side. I was babysitting from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., so I needed to make sure I was energized for the day ahead.\n\n*   I was feeling fine until around 1 p.m. when I hit a bit of a slump.\n*   Nevertheless, given that I went to bed at 2 a.m. the night before and had a 6 a.m. wake-up time, it was hard to tell if my crash in energy was due to lack of caffeine or lack", "category": "general"},

{"title": "Race and Social Justice", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/race-and-social-justice-5073654", "content": "**Race and Social Justice** Race is everywhere. It plays an important role in our identity and shapes our perspectives including how we think and feel about mental health. There are many mental health considerations unique to certain racial and cultural groups. The stigmatization of bisexual men, the strong Black women stereotype, and the lack of mental health services for Indigenous communities. These are just a few examples of how race and culture align with mental health and wellness.\n\n**What's the Difference Between Race and Ethnicity?**\n\nThe dictionary by Merriam-Webster defines race as a category of humankind that shares certain distinctive physical traits. 1 Race is usually associated with biology and linked with physical characteristics, such as hair texture or skin color, and covers a relatively narrow range of options. Yet people of similar complexions hair textures can be defined as different races, and definitions in the United States have changed over time.\n\n**What are the six categories of race?**\n\nWhen completing paperwork that asks for race, you may be asked to identify yourself as belonging to one or more of the following categories: \n\n1. White \n2. Black or African American \n3. Asian American \n4. American Indian or Alaska Native \n5. Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander \n6. Some other race\n\nSome may be considered to be of a certain race, Black people for example, may identify more with their individual ethnicity as opposed to race. This could apply to any member of any race.\n\n**Why is it important to learn about race and ethnicity?**\n\nConversations about race and ethnicity are key to building empathy, facilitating acceptance, understanding, and respect for those from other backgrounds. Such histories of other cultures and races are often erased or minimized from mainstream narratives, so it is essential to learn about the struggles and experiences of marginalized groups.\n\n**KEY TERMS**\n\n*   **BIPOC**: The acronym BIPOC stands for Black, Indigenous, and People Of Color and is pronounced buy-pock as opposed to saying each letter individually. The BIPOC acronym builds on the former acronym of POC ( people of color ), acknowledging that not all people of color have the same experiences or deal with the same types of injustice.\n*   **Inclusion**: Inclusion refers to the act or practice of including and accommodating people who have historically been excluded because of their race, gender, sexuality, or ability.\n*   **Diversity**: Diversity refers to the quality of representing people from a range of different social and ethnic backgrounds and of different genders, sexual orientations, etc.\n*   **Microaggressions**: A microaggression is a subtle verbal or nonverbal behavior, committed consciously or not, that is directed at a member of a marginalized group, and has a harmful, derogatory effect.\n*   **Cultural Assimilation**: Cultural assimilation refers to the act of sacrificing one's own culture to adopt the lifestyle, behaviors, and beliefs of the dominant culture group.\n*   **Intersectionality**: The term intersectionality was first coined by civil rights scholar Kimberl√© Crenshaw in the late '80s. It refers to an individual's multiple identities and how they're subject to various forms of intersecting oppression.\n\n**Explore Race and Social Justice**\n\n*   Why Identity Matters and How It Shapes Us\n*   10 Types of Discrimination to Be Aware Of\n*   Cultural Awareness-How to Be More Culturally Aware & Improve Your Relationships\n*   How Embracing Your Cultural Identity Can Help Your Mental Health\n*   The Impact of Racial Trauma and How to Cope\n\n**Recommended Reading**\n\n*   Why It's Important to Learn About Indigenous Peoples\n*   What Does the Acronym BIPOC Mean?\n*   Understanding White Privilege\n*   Is It Possible to Overcome Implicit Bias?\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n*   Mental Health Effects of Racism on Indigenous Communities\n*   Systemic Racism Takes a Toll on BIPOC Mental Health\n*   The Role of Silence in Asian American Families\n*   Let's End the 'Undesirable Asian Male' Stereotype\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n*   What is the concept of race?\n*   What are the six categories of race?\n*   Why is it important to learn about race and ethnicity?\n\n**Sources** \n\nPage Sources.

Perhaps you talked yourself out of it or convinced yourself that if you just wait a little while longer, the problem might go away. Or maybe you're still questioning if you should talk to someone but aren't sure it's a priority for you right now.\n\nKnowing when to see a therapist can be a little challenging sometimes. After all, everyone has a bad day or goes through a rough patch every now and again. But how do you know when talking to someone might help?\n\n**Self and Relationship Improvement**\n\n*   You Are Struggling to Reach Your Goals\n*   You Want to Improve Your Relationship(s)\n*   You Want to Increase Your Self-Awareness\n\n**Dealing With Major Life Events**\n\n*   You're Going Through a Transition\n*   You Want Some Parenting Support\n*   You Want Help Processing a Traumatic Event\n\n**Productivity Management**\n\n*   Your Mood Is Affecting Your Work\n*   Your Emotional State Is Impacting Your Appetite or Sleep\n*   Has it been tougher lately to do the things you want to or are expected to do?\n\n**Finding Yourself**\n\n*   You've Lost Interest in Activities You Used to Enjoy\n*   Your Social Life Is Suffering\n*   You Don't Feel as Happy as You Think You Could Be\n\n**Challenging Negative Thinking**\n\n*   You Want to Change Unhelpful Thinking Patterns\n*   You Suspect You Have Symptoms of a Mental Illness\n\n**Finding a Therapist**\n\nIn older, more traditional models of therapy, you waited until you were sick to get help. In fact, insurance companies only paid for treatment if you already had depression, anxiety, or some other mental illness.\n\nNow that more people are becoming aware of how important mental health is and are more open to discussing it, this older way of viewing therapy is evolving. Now, there are affordable ways to see a therapist before you experience a mental health problem (e.g., employee assistance programs and online therapy).\n\nTalking to a mental health professional early on may prevent mental illnesses before they start-and it also may help you to think, feel, and perform at your best.\n\nIf you decide to seek mental health support, you might start by talking to your physician. They may be able to help you find a therapist that is right for you.\n\nA Word From Verywell\n\nIf you're on the fence about whether to see a therapist, it might help to give it a try. Talking to someone outside of your family and friends might help you in more ways than one.\n\nKeep in mind that talking to a mental health professional doesn't mean anything is wrong with you. You might simply decide that seeing a therapist is what helps you become the best version of yourself. And talking to someone isn't a sign of weakness. After all, it takes strength to admit you don't have all the answers.\n\n**References**\n\n1.  2 Sources By Amy Morin, LCSW Amy Morin, LCSW, is a psychotherapist and international bestselling author.

Table of Contents Professional Considerations Positives of Changing Your Name Mistakes to Avoid Making the Decision Leading up to my wedding in 2005, I worked as an editor but aspired to be a writer. I told my brother that I needed to get published as Cathy Cassata before the wedding so I could keep my maiden name Cassata. He was quick to respond: Why do you need a published story to determine that? Just don't change it, if that's what you want. My husband shared the same sentiment and didn't bat an eye when I told him I wanted to keep my maiden name. In addition to anticipating how a name change would affect my career, I also didn't want to lose connection to a name and Italian culture I identified with since birth. Now that I have two children with their own last name, perhaps they feel the same allegiance to it. Today, my portfolio is packed with stories all with the same byline and I am still happy with my choice to keep my maiden name. Though, not every woman who gets married feels the same allegiance to her maiden name. In fact, 79% of women in opposite-sex marriages took their spouse's last name when they got married, according to 2023 Pew Research. Of women married to men, white women are more likely than Black and Hispanic women to take their spouses last name after marriage.1 Nora Gruenberg decided to take her ex-husband's last name because it was more important to him than keeping her maiden name was to her. I jumped into it with the attitude that I'm the same Nora but with an added layer. It was a rebrand! I know who I am, she says. In her divorce, she was given the right to reclaim her maiden name but she chose not to. It would seem that my philosophy that a 'Nora by any other name is just as Nora' still stands, she says. For women of all sexual orientations who have never been married, their views vary on the matter with 33% noting they would take their spouse's last name, 23% saying they would keep their maiden name, 17% saying they would hyphenate both names, and 24% indicating that they are not sure.1 Women taking their husband's last name began in the 9th century as a way to legally bind their identity to their husband and remove it from their father. Over time, taking on a spouse's name has become a tradition and symbolism of unity rather than an action that holds legal power. If you're about to get married or have recently married, you've probably given a lot of thought to the topic. So, should you change your name? Are there downsides to doing so? It's a personal choice that may vary from person to person, so let's take a look at why you may or may not want to change your name. Professional Considerations of Changing Your Name For some women, changing their last name after marriage may have no effect on their career. For others, Kathy Caprino, career coach, says it can alter how they are recognized within their professional networks, potentially impacting the reputation and personal brand they have built. For instance, if you have established a company or service with your maiden name and then change it, customers may become confused or it may be more confusing to share testimonials. Additionally, it can influence how we feel regarding our own personal identity and how we perceive ourselves internally and externally in our professional and personal circles, says Caprino. She suggests informing colleagues, clients, and professional contacts about your name change through a personal note or email. Administrative challenges, such as updating records and ensuring consistency across professional documents is another factor. A name change requires updating the following: Social Security card Driver's license Passport Bank accounts Professional licenses Employment records related to payroll, insurance, and retirement Personal records related to utility accounts, subscriptions, voter registration, etc. Each agency or organization may have its own process, timeline, and fees, so staying organized is crucial. For professionals with certifications or licenses, there can be additional requirements to ensure their updated name is recognized in their field, says Joe Nazarian, founder and managing partner at Pathway Law Firm. The administrative work was the biggest burden for Gruenberg. For women entertaining the thought of taking another name, really think about what it will take, she says. Now that I'm divorced, let me tell you, I'm not going through all of that again. Positives of Changing Your Name After Marriage Changing one's name after marriage might offer a fresh start or a new sense of privacy, especially if they wish to distance themselves from past professional associations or from families and individuals who weren't supportive or safe, says Cap", "category": "general"},
{"title": "Here's How to Connect With a Kid, According to Psychologists", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/ways-to-connect-with-kids-8724418", "content": "with Us\n\n**Here's How to Connect With a Kid, According to Psychologists**\n\n**Including some qs to ask them**\n\nBy Cathy Cassata Published on October 24, 2024 Verywell Mind Getty Images\n\n**Bridging the Gap**\n\nAsk Open-ended Questions\n\nAvoid Noisy Questions\n\nTips Topics to Avoid\n\nIt's not just me-talking to kids can be a struggle, right? Sometimes, it's like you have ~nothing~ in common. Other times, you forget they think and operate differently-their brains aren't fully developed-which makes connecting that more difficult.\n\nChildren are very much more in the moment than adults are, says Tammy Schamuhn, psychologist and cofounder of the Institute of Child Psychology. They don't focus as much on hindsight (the past) or foresight (what will happen in the future) as that is an executive functioning skill that is executed by the prefrontal cortex. (Btw, the brain finishes developing and maturing in the mid-to-late 20s with the prefrontal cortex maturing last).1 Moreover, children also have a more developed right hemisphere, where your emotions, movement, play, and creativity live, Schamuhn says.\n\nKids connect with their parents through mutual activities [like] riding bikes together, play, cuddling, and storytelling. All of this makes chatting with a seven-year-old a bit difficult. But there are ways to make connecting between us adults and kids super easy. Here's how.\n\n**How to Bridge the Gap Between an Adult Mind and Kid's Mind**\n\nKids' needs vary and change over time, which makes it tough for parents to know how to connect. Parent-child relationships are multidimensional, so sometimes children want you close. Other times, they want their independence, says Deborah Serani, PsyD, a psychologist and professor at Adelphi University.\n\nThis goes for little ones, teens, and even older adult children. A great way to slowly bridge this communication gap is by practicing empathy. A powerful way to foster empathy is to reflect on what it was like to be their age-what they felt, what they thought about, and how they behaved, Gretchen Moran Marsh, PhD, licensed clinical psychologist, says.\n\nShe adds that when adults put themselves in a kid's shoes, they are often surprised by the differences in their childhood perspective and adult thinking. Once adults reconnect with their younger selves, they tend to gain a greater sense of empathy and understanding for what children are going through.\n\n**A 4-Step Approach to Connecting**\n\nSerani recommends practicing the following steps to improve your connection with kids:\n\n1. Break the ice: Start off with something like, Oh, you're playing with your Legos\n2. Deepen the interest: Try asking Want some help? or Want someone to play with? and wait for their response. Depending on their needs, join in, or move on to another room.\n3. Make a deeper connection: If you're invited to join, ask open-ended questions like What do you want me to do? or What are we making?\n4. Continue to get deeper: Take the convo a step further by asking, How was school today? or What was T-ball like yesterday?\n\nThe goal is to meet a child at their comfort level, so they see your presence, interest, and connection is about wanting to be with them, Serani says.\n\n**Other Ways to Connect**\n\nStructured activities are great ways to connect with children. Serani suggests the following:\n\n*   Games like Do You Really Know Your Family, Beat the Parents, and Ungame.\n*   Books or journals such as The Us Journal and Just Between Us.\n*   Movement-based activities like playing tag or riding bikes.\n*   Outings or hobbies like going to the movies together or cooking together.\n\n**Ask Open-ended Questions**\n\nRather than asking kids close-ended questions like, How was your day or Did you have a good time at the party? which often instigates one-word responses like fine or ok, ask open-ended questions that tease the imagination or emotional centers of the brain, says Schamuhn. She suggests the following:\n\n*   If you could have a superpower, what would it be?\n*   What was the best worst part of your day?\n*   Tell me about a moment you were brave kind today?\n*   What are you grateful for?\n*   Tell me about someone you helped today?\n*   What's something you're looking forward to?\n*   What is something that makes you feel scared or worried?\n*   If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you go?\n*   If you could change the world in one way, what would you change?\n*   What do you wish we did differently as a family?\n*   What do you wish I did differently as a parent?\n\n**Get to Know Someone Better Through These 50 Questions**\n\nOpen-ended Questions Help Develop Kids' Well-being\n\nSerani says parents asking simple and concise open-ended questions about their kids' unique experiences can help form a positive connection and increase their well-being. This particular kind of well-being is called flourishing, where children develop optimism, a sense of belonging, greater self-confidence, autonomy, positive self-esteem, and many other traits.\n\nStudies looking at parent-child interactions around the globe revealed that the greater the family connection, the higher the rate of flourishing.3 Children with parents who love and have genuine interest in their singular specialness develop character strengths that help them move through adversity better in life, and find meaning and purpose in life, Serani adds.\n\n**Share Your Own Perspective (But Not *Too* Much)**\n\nWhen trying to connect with kids and teens, sharing your own experiences can be helpful but timing is everything, says Moran Marsh. I always recommend staying focused on the child's interests first. Make sure you truly understand their perspective before offering your own stories, she adds.\n\nTry This To gauge their interest in your perspective while respecting their autonomy and keeping the conversation balanced, consider asking questions like:\n\n*   Do you want to hear about a time when I went through something similar?\n*   I know what that's like. That happened to me too.\n*   Want to hear about it?\n\nIf they want to know more specifics, share minimal disclosure. If they want more, they will let you know by asking for more information.\n\nWhen we overshare and kids aren't ready for our stories, they feel like they are being lectured to or are overwhelmed by the information they're not ready to process, Serani says. So the trick to talking to kids is to let them lead the social dance steps. Once children feel heard and validated, they may naturally invite your perspective, asking questions like:\n\n*   What would you do in this situation?\n*   If they aren't ready for advice, respect that boundary, says Moran Marsh.\n\nRemember, children want to feel important, and moving too quickly into problem-solving can invalidate their thoughts, leading to emotional escalation.\n\n**Avoid Questions That Seem Nosy**\n\nChildren are highly perceptive and can quickly see through an adult's agenda, says Moran Marsh. Ask questions from a place of genuine curiosity rather than trying to steer the conversation. Take your time, and remember that your goal is to empathize and understand what the child is experiencing, she says.\n\nRapid-fire questions, especially if they come", "category": "general"},

No matter what you do or say, they will still behave narcissistically.\n*   If, on the other hand, the person you're dealing with is not actually a narcissist but is still behaving badly, you might want to (and be able to) explore what has triggered them to act the way they are acting.\n\n**Treatment for Narcissistic Personality Disorder**\n\n*   The best treatment for NPD is psychotherapy, or talk therapy.\n*   If someone with NPD pursues therapy and commits to changing the way they think about themselves and interact with the world, therapy can be successful. 1.1. Understanding and managing their emotions and tendencies, like their competitiveness and their inherent dislike of others and themselves\n    1.2. Relating more effectively with those around them to make their working and personal relationships better\n    1.3. Recognizing what they are actually good at in order to better tolerate criticism and failure\n    1.4. Setting realistic goals\n    1.5. Understanding and handling issues about self-esteem\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\n*   While narcissistic personality disorder is one of the more common personality disorders, the term narcissism is often used without a full understanding of the actual condition itself.\n*   Recognizing the difference between a true narcissist and someone who is just behaving unpleasantly can help people learn to more effectively deal with someone who does actually have NPD. 1.

How can I tell if someone is trying to manipulate me under the guise of setting a boundary?\n3. What are some signs that manipulation is occurring in a relationship?\n4. How do I communicate effectively with others when setting boundaries or addressing potential manipulation?\n5. What are some consequences of being manipulated in a relationship, and how can I protect myself? \n- \n**What Boundaries Look Like**\n\nSetting boundaries involves clearly communicating your needs and expectations to others while maintaining respect for their feelings and perspectives.\n\n1.  You have repeatedly asked your partner to help you with chores around the house, and they have consistently ignored you.\n2.  A person has requested that you change your behavior or meet a specific need of theirs in a respectful manner.\n3.  Someone is asking for something reasonable and achievable from you.\n4.  There's an open conversation about the problem and how to solve it together.\n\n**What Manipulation Looks Like**\n\nManipulation involves using guilt, threats, or other tactics to get what you want without considering the feelings or needs of others.\n\n1.  A person is making unreasonable demands of you, threatening consequences if their expectations aren't met.\n2.  Someone is not respecting your boundaries and is pushing you to do something that makes you uncomfortable.\n3.  There's no discussion about how to improve a situation together; instead, there's a focus on getting what one wants at the expense of others.\n4.  The person imposing the boundary is more focused on their own needs than on finding a solution that benefits both parties.\n\n**How to Tell the Difference**\n\nWhen setting boundaries, you're asking someone to respect your needs in a respectful manner. When manipulating, you're only focusing on what you want without considering anyone else's feelings or needs.\n\n1.  Consider what was asked of you.\n2.  Determine if it's something you can change and if it's reasonable.\n3.  Think about how the request was made: was it respectful or did it involve threats or guilt?\n4.  Reflect on who benefits from the situation and whether it's a win-win or a lose-lose.\n\n**How to Respond**\n\nIf someone is trying to manipulate you, try to engage them in conversation about the problem.\n\n1.  Ask them to explain what they need specifically.\n2.  Determine if their request is reasonable and achievable.\n3.  Discuss how to solve the problem together.\n4.  Set clear expectations for future interactions.\n\n**How to Change Your Behavior**\n\nIf you suspect that you've been manipulating someone, ask yourself these questions:\n\n1.  Am I trying to improve the situation or just get out of it?\n2.  Is what I'm asking for impossible or unreasonable?\n3.  Am I feeling like I want to punish this person?\n4.  Am I considering how my ultimatum will affect this person?\n\nBy recognizing the difference between boundaries and manipulation, you can build stronger relationships based on mutual respect and understanding.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n*   Setting boundaries is healthy; manipulation is toxic.\n*   Recognizing the signs of manipulation can help prevent destructive relationships.\n*   Effective communication is key to setting healthy boundaries and preventing manipulation. \n- The One Way You Might Be Manipulating Your Loved Ones Without Realizing It\n\n**What Boundaries Look Like**\n\nSetting boundaries involves clearly communicating your needs and expectations to others while maintaining respect for their feelings and perspectives.\n\n1.

Dixon, Psy.D, a licensed clinical psychologist.\n\nThis turmoil is a natural response to the loss of trust and connection, and it can take time to process and heal from these feelings.\n\nGive yourself time to process what happened, and then-if it feels right-take these steps to rebuild your friendship again.\n\n1.  Validate Your Pain\n    Acknowledge your pain and hurt.\n    Feeling grief is a healthy and normal response, and it is important to honor these feelings and not minimize or avoid them.\n\n2.  Have an Open, Honest Conversation\n    Step number two is to talk it out-ideally in person.\n    A phone call may work, but try to avoid texting back and forth for this one.\n    Having a conversation about how the person hurt you, why you feel betrayed, and allowing them to apologize and acknowledge the pain they've caused is a great first step in rebuilding the friendship, says Goldberg.\n\n3.  Listen to Their Side\n    Give your friend a chance to explain their perspective.\n    This allows you to better understand where they are coming from, which can mend hurt feelings and soften anger.\n    This is also an opportunity to assess whether their apology feels genuine, and if you think that it's possible to move forward.\n\n4.  Remind Yourself Why You Were Friends\n    In the face of betrayal, you may question your own judgment with friendships.\n    As long as this is a one-off betrayal (versus an ongoing pattern), it may be helpful to remind yourself why you two were friends to begin with.\n    Goldberg says, \"Reminding yourself of the reasons you are grateful for the friendship can help put you back in the mindset of how much care there is between you two.\"\n\n5.  Genuinely Forgive Them\n    Grudges and building resentment won't help either of you.\n    Dr. Dixon says, \"Decide to forgive, while also clearly communicating your expectations for the friendship moving forward.\"\n    This helps establish a foundation of trust and respect as you work to rebuild your connection.\n\n6.  Take Small Steps to Reconnect\n    You may be surprised at how good you feel once you've hashed things out with your friend.\n    Even then, it's smart to ease back into the friendship.\n    Dr. Ramsey suggests taking small steps to reconnect and reestablish shared activities and positive experiences, allowing the friendship to grow and heal over time.\n    It may take some time, and things may not feel exactly like they once were, but following these steps will help you rebuild your friendship and get back to a more familiar place.\n\n**The Truth About *Real* Friendships**\n\nHere's the thing about any type of relationship: they're going to have ups and downs and won't follow a linear path.\nUnderstanding that human nature is flawed means one person's mistakes don't necessarily reflect who they are or how they can continue to support you in the future, says licensed therapist Rachel Goldberg, LMFT, PMH-C.\n\nKeep that in mind as you forge your path.\nBottom line: If you feel strongly that the bond you shared is worth rekindling-and if both parties are willing to learn and grow from past experiences-it is worthwhile to explore re-connection.\nScience repeatedly shows that friendships keep us healthy and happy, so putting effort into mending things when it makes sense is worth it in the long run.3\n\n**6 Benefits of Friendship and Why It's So Important to Stay Close**\n\nRead More: LIVING WELL RELATIONSHIPS 2 Sources\n\nBy Wendy Rose Gould\nWendy Rose Gould is a lifestyle reporter with over a decade of experience covering health and wellness topics.\nSee Our Editorial Process\nMeet Our Review Board\nShare Feedback \n\nNote that the original text was not provided in Markdown format, so it could not be directly converted.

Block, MD\nUpdated on July 19, 2024\n\nBipolar disorder is a mental health condition defined by periods (or episodes) of extreme mood disturbances that affect mood, thoughts, and behavior.\n\n#### There are two main types of bipolar disorders\n\n*   Bipolar I disorder involves episodes of severe mania and often depression.\n*   Bipolar II disorder involves a less severe form of mania called hypomania.\n*   There is also a third type known as cyclothymic disorder.\n\nResearch suggests that around 4.4% of U.S. adults will have bipolar disorder at some point in their lives.\n\n#### Genetics are thought to play a significant role, although brain abnormalities and environmental factors also contribute as causes of bipolar disorder\n\nMood stabilizers are usually the first-line treatment, but electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be used to address severe symptoms.\n\n### LIVING WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER\n\n5 Movies That Portray What It's Like to Have Bipolar Disorder\nSpeaking to a Loved One With Bipolar Disorder\nWhat It Really Feels Like to Live With Bipolar Disorder\nCould Your Child Have Bipolar Disorder?\n\n### FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\n#### What causes bipolar disorder?\n\nThe exact causes of bipolar disorder are not entirely understood. Research has shown that genetics play a significant role.\n\nOther causes include changes in the brain as well as environmental factors including childhood trauma or stress caused by major life changes.\n\nUnderstanding the causes may help scientists develop ways to prevent or treat the condition.\n\n#### Is bipolar disorder genetic?\n\nResearch suggests there is a strong genetic component in bipolar disorder. Twin studies have found that when one identical twin has the condition, the likelihood that their twin sibling will also have it is around 40%.\n\nWhile there is a genetic vulnerability, inherited factors interact with environmental influences that can play a role in triggering the disorder's onset.\n\n#### How is bipolar disorder treated?\n\nBipolar disorder is typically treated with medications and sometimes electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), therapy, and psychoeducation.\n\nCommon medications include mood stabilizers or anticonvulsants, as well as second or third generation antipsychotics. Antidepressants are typically avoided if possible due to risks including mania and rapid cycling.\n\n### Is bipolar disorder considered a disability?\n\nYour condition may be considered a disability that is protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or qualifies you for disability payments.\n\nIf your disability substantially limits your work, you may be able to request reasonable accommodations from your employer. You may qualify for disability benefits if your condition makes it impossible for you to maintain employment.\n\n### How do you know if you're bipolar?\n\nOnly a doctor or qualified mental health professional can diagnose you with bipolar disorder.\n\nYou may want to see your doctor if you are experiencing symptoms of mania, depression, or both.\n\nSymptoms of mania can include talking excessively, racing thoughts, decreased sleep, and delusions. Symptoms of depression may include fatigue, prolonged sadness, and loss of interest in activities.\n\n### KEY TERMS\n\n*   Bipolar I Disorder\n*   Bipolar II Disorder\n*   Cyclothymic Disorder\n*   Mania\n*   Hypomania\n*   Depression\n*   Psychotherapy\n*   Major Depressive Disorder\n*   Psychiatric Assessment\n*   Mood Charting\n\n### EXPLORE BIPOLAR DISORDER\n\nOver One-Third of Psychiatric Patients Are Misdiagnosed‚ÄîHere Are Our Stories\n\nThe 8 Best Online Psychiatry Services That Take Insurance, Tried and Tested\n\nUnderstanding Autism and Bipolar Disorder\n\nCan Bipolar Disorder Show Up in a Brain Scan?\n\nAre There Different Types of Bipolar Disorder?\n\nWhat's the Difference Between Bipolar I and Bipolar II Disorder?\n\nWhat Is a Labile Affect?\n\nHypomania vs. Mania: What's the Difference?\n\nWhat It's Like Living with a Mood Disorder, As a Mental Health Professional\n\nIs Bipolar Disorder Caused By a Chemical Imbalance?\n\nCan Bipolar Disorder Cause Brain Damage?\n\nWhat Is Therapy for Bipolar Disorder?\n\nCan Bipolar Disorder Be Cured?\n\nHow Do I Know If I Have Bipolar Disorder?\n\nUnderstanding the BPD Favorite Person Relationship\n\nAn Overview of Mental Health Statistics\n\nBipolar Depression Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment\n\nBipolar Disorder Symptoms in Men\n\nWhat Medications Are Used to Treat Bipolar Disorder?\n\nBipolar Disorder Symptoms in Women\n\nWhat to Know About Coming Out of a Manic Episode\n\nDifferentiating Subtypes of Bipolar Disorder\n\nTreating Bipolar Disorder\n\nLoving With Bipolar Disorder: A Letter to My Husband\n\nWhat Does the Term 'High-Functioning' Bipolar Disorder Mean?\n\nHelpful Online Bipolar Disorder Support Groups\n\nThe Impact of Bipolar Disorder on Sex\n\nTips for Dating Someone With Bipolar Disorder\n\nLiving With Bipolar Disorder\n\nDoes Bipolar Disorder Qualify You for Disability?\n\nWhat Not to Do if You or a Friend Has Bipolar Disorder\n\nRacing Thoughts and Bipolar Disorder\n\nHow Long Do Manic and Depressive Episodes Last?\n\nTechniques to Tame the Fight-or-Flight Response\n\nSpring Mania: What It Is and What to Do If It Happens\n\nUnderstanding Bipolar Disorder and Narcissistic Personality Disorder\n\nWhat Is a Thought Disorder?\n\nWhat Is Emotional Lability?\n\nWhat Are Somatic Delusions?\n\nTreatment for Psychosis\n\nWhat Is Thought Broadcasting?\n\nUnderstanding Euthymia in Bipolar Disorder\n\nVivid Dreams, Nightmares, and Night Terrors in Bipolar Disorder\n\nRapid-Cycling Bipolar Disorder Symptoms, Risks, and Treatment\n\nDelusions Occurring in Bipolar Disorder\n\nSymptoms and Causes of Tardive Dyskinesia\n\nIdeas and Delusions of Reference in Bipolar Disorder\n\nMood Congruence and Incongruence in Bipolar Disorder\n\nMixed Episode Criteria for Bipolar Disorder\n\nClang Association in Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia\n\nWhat Is Psychosis?\n\nUnderstanding Bruxism and How It Relates to Mental Health\n\nWhat Is Bipolar Psychosis?\n\nWhat Are Hallucinations?\n\nDifferences Between Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia\n\nWhat Is Apathy?\n\nHow Sleep and Bipolar Disorder Interact\n\nWhat Is Akathisia?\n\nFlight of Ideas in Bipolar Disorder\n\nUnderstanding Mania and Manic Episodes\n\nQuiz for Bipolar Hypomania Episodes\n\nWhat Is Hypomania?\n\nSymptoms of Mania in Bipolar Disorder\n\n### More In Conditions A-Z\n\n*   Neurodivergence\n*   Phobias\n*   Anxiety\n*   Kids' Mental Health\n*   Addiction\n*   ADHD\n*   Eating Disorders\n*   BPD\n*   Depression", "category": "general"},
{"title": "Are You Phubbing Your Partner?", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-phubbing-8647390", "content": "on This Article How to Put Your Phone Down and Live in the Moment\n\n**What Is Phubbing?**\nPhubbing is a term used to describe when someone prioritizes their phone over interacting with others. It can happen anywhere, from casual social settings to intimate relationships.\n\n*   A study found that 50% of U.S. adults have been phubbed by their partner.\n*   Phubbing can lead to decreased relationship satisfaction and intimacy.\n*   Research shows that both parties suffer from anxiety, depression, and loneliness due to phubbing.\n\n**Effects of Phubbing on Relationships**\nPhubbing can have a significant impact on relationships. When someone prioritizes their phone over interacting with others, it sends the message that whatever they're doing is more important than the person in front of them.\n\n*   This can lead to decreased relationship satisfaction and intimacy.\n*   It can also result in a lack of trust between partners and problems with face-to-face communication.\n*   Phubbing can happen in any relationship, from romantic partnerships to friendships and family relationships.\n\n**How Phubbing Affects Your Mental Health**\nPhubbing can also have negative effects on mental health. Constantly turning to our phones can make us lose the ability to have raw and vulnerable moments with loved ones.\n\n*   Research shows that both parties suffer from anxiety, depression, and loneliness due to phubbing.\n*   Phubbing can lead to feelings of guilt, disconnection, and decreased intimacy.\n*   It can also result in increased anxiety, feelings of awkwardness, and depression.\n\n**Signs You're Phubbing or Being Phubbed in Your Relationship**\nTo determine whether you're phubbing in your relationship-or being phubbed-look for the following signs:\n\n1.  The person you are with always has their phone nearby or in their hands.\n2.  They always tell you to hold on while they're texting.\n3.  If someone often says 'hold on' while someone else is trying to get their attention, it signals that their phone is a higher priority.\n4.  If someone gets anxious or distracted when there's a notification and their attention shifts away from the conversation to their mobile device.\n5.  If a person favors communication by phone instead of directly speaking to you.\n6.  Or, they start feeling more comfortable reaching out via social media instead of in-person interactions.\n7.  They become defensive about their cellphone usage.\n\n**3 Steps You Can Take to Stop Phubbing**\nWhether you're concerned about your phone usage or your partner and their smartphone habits, here are steps you (or your partner) can take to stop phubbing:\n\n1.  Modify Your Phone Usage\n2.  Seek Professional Help\n3.  Think About Why You Are Phubbing\n\nYou can modify your phone usage by silencing your ringer when out with a friend or keeping your phone in your pocket when spending time with your spouse. You can also seek professional help if you're struggling with setting screentime limits. Lastly, think about why you are phubbing and what steps you need to take to make a change. Putting the phone down may be just the help that your relationship needs.", "category": "general"},

Retrieved from [www.nytimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com)\n \n**So, Do You *Actually* Like Them or Is It the Romantic Fantasy Talking?**\n\nWhen you meet someone new, it's hard not to feel completely enamored by their presence and the prospect of a new romance. Especially if they're super attractive, schmoozing you in all the right ways, and have no upfront red flags. But are you really feeling them or just the idea of them (and the possible happily ever after you two could have)? Let's find out.\n\n**The Importance of Understanding Your Feelings**\n\nFirst step: identify your feelings. Look, we've all felt the instant giddiness and excitement over getting to know someone new. But take a step back-stop romanticizing!-and identify your feelings. Understanding how you feel is helpful in any context but is especially crucial in romantic relationships.\n\n*   A relationship in which we are content will improve our sense of self-esteem, perhaps improving quality of life, job performance, and achievement of goals.\n*   Having clarity on your feelings is kind of cool and empowering. It allows you to believe in yourself and make confident decisions.\n\n**What Does It Mean to Really Like Someone?**\n\nCrushes are a dime a dozen. There's that sweet barista at the local coffee shop, the cutie you've been on a few dates with already, the coworker who always makes you blush. But do you like any of them-or the image of them in your head? It's tricky to tell the difference because practically every budding relationship starts with some level of infatuation and (perhaps naive) adoration.\n\n*   In fact, studies go so far as to say that initial euphoric feelings are akin to the high you'd experience taking a drug like cocaine.\n*   But that attraction only goes so far, especially once you begin asking yourself the important questions.\n\n**The Role of Loneliness in Finding Love**\n\nDating is hard, okay? It's not for the weak! The loneliness you feel when a situationship falls apart or your crush is no longer interested...like, we've all been there before. And while loneliness is not inherently negative, it can make us delusional in romantic relationships.\n\n*   We often struggle with separating loneliness from deeper emotions such as rejection, abandonment, shame, or worthlessness-what I refer to as the four horsemen of childhood trauma.\n*   When my clients are struggling with loneliness, particularly after a breakup, they realize this feeling is a normal response to the situation. At other times, loneliness is heavier when connected to a childhood trigger.\n\n**What to Do If You're Still Unsure**\n\nOprah once famously said, I don't know means no. AKA, if you're feeling eh about them, chances are you're not interested. If you're not sure if you're into someone, you're probably not, Holz says.\n\n*   Perhaps a cognitive part of you likes some of their qualities on paper, but you're not attracted to them or excited by them when you're together.\n*   Being uncertain doesn't mean you need to break off ties or plunge deeper into the relationship-there's no rush to the finish line here. Keep exploring, but give yourself a date-say, two weeks or a month-to sift through your feelings.\n\n**Signs You Like Someone**\n\nThey make you feel good\nYou want to keep learning about them\nYou can be your authentic self around them\nYou make time for them\nYou find joy in doing nice things for them\nYou feel energized versus drained by them\nYou have shared interests\nYour values are aligned\nYou remember small details about them\nYou may feel a little nervous in their presence (in the early stages)\nYou may feel like you're with someone you've known forever\nYou share similar goals\nYou feel safe and respected\nYou think about them even when they're gone\nYou're endeared by even their odd traits\n\n**Signs You Just Like the Idea of Them**\n\nYou only want to spend time with them when you're bored or lonely\nYou find them physically attractive but aren't quite sure about their personality\nYou feel drained after spending time with them\nYou are fixated more on whether they like you versus you liking each other\nYour feelings fluctuate depending on your mood\nYou're hyped on their potential (or an idealized version of them) versus who they really are\nYour interest in them is driven by how they make you look to others\nYou don't feel a strong emotional connection\nYou don't have shared values\nOutside pressures are making it feel like you need to stay together\nYou don't share similar life goals\nThere's no spark\nThe relationship feels stagnant\nYou don't really see a long-term future with this person\n\n**What We Can Learn from This**\n\nDating is hard, okay? It's not for the weak! The loneliness you feel when a situationship falls apart or your crush is no longer interested...like, we've all been there before. And while loneliness is not inherently negative, it can make us delusional in romantic relationships.\n\n*   We often struggle with separating loneliness from deeper emotions such as rejection, abandonment, shame, or worthlessness-what I refer to as the four horsemen of childhood trauma.\n*   When my clients are struggling with loneliness, particularly after a breakup, they realize this feeling is a normal response to the situation.

Take This Quiz to Find Out**\n\nSee which friend profile matches you best\n\nBy Sanjana Gupta\nPublished on June 28, 2024\n\nAnchiy E+ Getty Images\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Friendship Quiz\nWho Is This Quiz For?\nThe Different Types of Friends\nWhy It's Important to Know What Kind of Friend You Are\n\nHave you ever wondered what kind of friend you are in your circle? We all play different roles in our relationships with others and sometimes it's fun to think about how our friends see us. Understanding your role as a friend profoundly influences the dynamics of your friendships, says Ashley Pe√±a, LCSW, National Executive Director of Outpatient Services at AMFM Healthcare. That's why we've created this free quiz-take it to find out what kind of friend you are.\n\n**The Friendship Quiz**\n\nThis friendship quiz can help you figure out the type of friend you are. If more than one answer resonates with you, that's perfectly fine-just select the answer that reflects the most likely scenario.\n\n**Who Is This Quiz For?**\n\nEver wondered why your friends keep you around? This quiz can help you understand your strengths as a friend. If you're doing some self-reflection around your relationships, it can help you understand your role in your friends' lives. In fact, research shows us that being more self-aware can help improve the quality of our relationships.1 Understanding your role as a friend profoundly influences the dynamics of your friendships.\n\n- ASHLEY PE√ëA, LCSW\n\n**The Different Types of Friends**\n\nThese are some of the different types of friendship roles that you might play:\n\n*   The planner: Corralling a big group can be complicated. With a mix of personalities, interests, and tastes, it's never easy to get everyone in the same place at the same time for a gathering that everyone will enjoy.\n*   The supportive listener: In any group of friends, it's inevitable that there will be difficult times at one point or another. From heartbreak to turmoil in the group and everything in between, there is a constant need for that friend with an empathetic nature to help navigate all the ups and down of life.\n*   The comic relief: Every group has a goofball-the friend who is always ready with a joke or a funny memory to lighten the mood. In good times and bad, this friend can always be relied on to put a smile on everyone's face.\n*   The life of the party: A strong group of friends will often be able to keep each other energized and have fun even when you're just staying in for the night. But sometimes we could use a little extra push from the extrovert in the group who is always working to make sure everyone is having fun.\n\n**Why It's Important to Know What Kind of Friend You Are**\n\nUnderstanding what kind of friend you are can be helpful in several ways:\n\n*   Strengthens your friendships: By reflecting on your strengths and weaknesses as a friend, you can identify areas where you can improve the way you connect with your friends.\n*   Helps you form new connections: Knowing your personality, communication style, and what you value in friendships can help you seek out people who are on your wavelength. In fact, research shows us that people with similar personalities tend to get along better as friends,2 so being more aware of your personality can help you connect with like-minded people.\n*   Improves self-awareness: Understanding how you show up in friendships can reveal aspects of your personality you might not have noticed before. This self-awareness can benefit all areas of your life, not just friendships.\n*   Boosts confidence: Knowing your strengths as a friend can be a confidence booster because it allows you to recognize the value you bring to friendships. Friendship, like any relationship, requires mutual effort and understanding between people. Being aware of how you contribute strengthens the bond and fosters openness and connection.\n\n- ASHLEY PE√ëA, LCSW\n\n6 Benefits of Friendship and Why It's So Important to Stay Close Read More: LIVING WELL RELATIONSHIPS 2 Sources\n\nBy Sanjana Gupta\nSanjana is a health writer and editor.

They allow us to realize what's most important to us, from the people we care about to the opinions we hold, and force us to navigate the complexities of everyday life.\n\n**The 6 Types of Basic Emotions and Their Effect on Human Behavior**\n\nEmotions are influenced by a network of interconnected structures in the brain that make up what is known as the limbic system. Key structures including the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the limbic cortex play a pivotal role in emotions and behavioral responses.\n\n**Emotions and Types of Emotional Responses**\n\n*   Emotions can manifest in various ways, such as physical sensations, thoughts, and behaviors.\n*   They can be triggered by internal factors, like our thoughts and memories, or external stimuli, like people, events, or environments.\n\n**The Important Role of Emotions**\n\nEmotions play a vital role in our lives, serving as signals that help us navigate the world around us. They provide us with valuable information about ourselves and others, enabling us to form connections, build relationships, and achieve our goals.\n\n**Healthy Coping Skills for Uncomfortable Emotions**\n\nDeveloping healthy coping skills is essential when dealing with uncomfortable emotions. This can include practices like mindfulness, deep breathing, exercise, or creative expression. By learning to manage our emotions in a constructive way, we can reduce stress, improve our overall well-being, and cultivate emotional resilience.\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n*   How many emotions are there?\n    *   While it was previously identified that there are six basic emotions-happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger, and surprise-that are universally experienced in all human cultures, researchers have now found that there are 27 different categories of emotions.\n*   Can we control our emotions?\n    *   As human beings, we have the ability to self-regulate, or manage our thoughts, behaviors, and emotions-allowing us to better handle stress, deal with conflict, and accomplish our goals.\n\n**Key Terms**\n\n*   **Emotional Intelligence**: refers to the ability to perceive, control, and evaluate emotions.\n*   **Emotion Wheel**: an emotion classification system introduced by psychologist Robert Plutchik in the 1980s. The model allowed us to label our feelings, so we can develop our emotional literacy skills to have a greater awareness of ourselves and the emotions of others.\n*   **Expression**: is the act of communicating our thoughts and emotions with others, verbally or non-verbally.\n*   **Mood**: can be defined as a relatively stable affective state that is often described as positive or negative. Unlike emotions, which tend to be stronger and more specific, moods are more general and less intense.\n\n**Explore Understanding Emotions**\n\n1.  Is Everyone Looking At My Skin?

Dealbreakers in friendship don't often start off as dealbreakers, she began.\n\nShe explained that it usually starts as one friend making the occasional concession-covering the dinner tab, being the first to apologize, or generally deferring to the other person's wants. Yet, over time, when the first friend is always the one making compromises or giving a little more, this creates a pattern that can erode friendships.\n\nThe friendship cracks become hard to ignore. You have a conversation with your friend about your concerns and issues arise, she continued. These common include when a friend refuses to see the issue at hand, dismisses it, or (gasp) says you're being too sensitive. This type of response indicates a deep indifference to your feelings.\n\nWhile, in my case, my feelings weren't flat-out denied, I also felt they weren't taken seriously, evidenced by my friend's spotty communication. Plus, Blake brings up a good point. If a friend does not care about the relational dynamics that make up your friendship, that is going to be a very lonely friendship to be in and one that I'd offer is not healthy to stay in, she concluded.\n\nBlankenbecler is a friendship educator, so I was eager to hear how she believes friendship fallouts could be avoided. Her answer provided insight into the power of honesty. Based on some past friendship trauma, I believed that my friends really didn't care or even notice when I'd go dark for a few weeks if I was busy, she says.\n\nIf a friend does not care about the relational dynamics that make up your friendship, that is going to be a very lonely friendship to be in and one that I'd offer is not healthy to stay in. - BLAKE BLANKENBECLER, THERAPIST AND FRIENDSHIP EDUCATOR\n\nIt wasn't until a friend let her know how her going dark impacted them, leading her to create stories in her mind about why Blake was being distant. Not only did this help Blake realize the importance of communication, especially during busy times, but it also let her know that their friendship does really matter and her friends do notice and care when she is less available.\n\nCreating a culture in your friendships that values kind honesty and generosity is incredibly important for the sustainability of a friendship, she concluded.\n\n**It's Those Behaviors That Make You Feel Unsafe**\n\nNatalie Moore, a licensed therapist in California, identifies a friendship deal breaker as anything that makes you feel unsafe or uncomfortable in the relationship. Think along the lines of deception, betrayal, disrespect, or a lack of consistent support.\n\nWhen I asked her for examples of how these friendship deal breakers can show up in common situations, she named a few I think many of us can relate to. Your friend sharing your personal secrets with someone else, speaking badly about you behind your back... breaking promises, and overstepping your boundaries can all be possible dealbreakers, she shared.\n\nEven her listing off those examples made me think back to friendships I have had throughout my life, especially when younger, and how painful some of those experiences were. Your friend sharing your personal secrets with someone else, speaking badly about you behind your back... breaking promises, and overstepping your boundaries can all be possible dealbreakers - NATALIE MOORE, LMFT\n\nWhen it comes to addressing friendship deal breakers, Moore recommends following a simple formula-state what they did that bothered them, name what you would like them to do instead, and share how you believe their changes will improve the relationship.\n\nFriendships can be mended if you get a genuine sense that your friend is invested in the relationship and willing to make the changes you've asked them to make. But, she cautions, if your friend did something unforgivable that makes you question their values or judgment, it may be grounds to end the friendship for your own self-protection.\n\n**When They Just Don't Keep Their Word**\n\nResha Altai, a psychotherapist based in Los Angeles, California, feels a friendship deal breaker is when a boundary is broken. A very common example is loaning a friend money with an agreement that they will pay you back by a certain date, only to have that date come and go without communication, she explained.\n\nShe continued by expressing how this can be especially troublesome if integrity is a major value of yours-which it likely is for many people. However, she agrees with my initial take that conflict can't always be avoided. Rupture and repair is a natural part of any relationship, she shared.\n\nIt is all about being upfront and transparent about your boundaries, needs, and values to avoid friendship fallouts. Can A Friendship Be Mended Post Dealbreaker?\n\nCan a friendship be mended after a dealbreaker has occurred? It certainly can be, but there are some considerations to keep in mind. Has your friend acknowledged the dealbreaker? Has a sincere apology and changed behavior occurred? Resha encourages folks to ask themselves.\n\nIf the answer to both is yes, then there's great evidence that things could be mended. If not, she recommends taking a hard look at if this is the relationship for you or not. Blake abides by the old adage that time heals. Time can often be a great softener, she explained.\n\nShe noted that having time apart to think about your parts in the unhealthy friendship dynamics can allow the two of you to come back together with a deeper sense of empathy. But, don't expect things to immediately bounce back to how they were. Folks don't always make room for how hard it can be to mend a relationship.\n\nIt is true, sometimes we can breeze past the fact that fights and fallouts in relationships of all sorts are big deals. But, Blake stands by the idea of hanging in there and working through all the tender and awkward stages that come with mending a friendship.\n\nAnd, in the event things can't be mended? She encourages you to allow yourself space to grieve.\n\n**What Boundaries Actually Mean**\n\nIn Natalie's practice, she provides a lot of meaningful wisdom into the power", "category": "general"},

Post a comment Cancel 0 of 1000 characters\n\n**10 Signs an Emotionally Unavailable Man Is in Love with You**\n\n**Signs of Emotional Unavailability**\n\n*   Surface-level conversations: Conversations stay light and skate across the surface.\n*   Confusing behavior: One day your partner is super attentive, showering you with affection. The next, he's barely responsive.\n*   Fear of commitment: Your partner might avoid labels, shy away from long-term plans, or seem reluctant to define the relationship.\n*   Lack of vulnerability: It can sometimes feel like your partner is physically present but emotionally distant.\n*   Distractions: When things start getting too real, he might steer things back to flirting or joking around.\n*   Emotional avoidance: Your partner may not just struggle with feeling the extent of their own emotions without shutting down or denying them.\n\n**Signs an Emotionally Unavailable Man Is in Love with You**\n\n1.  He starts to open up\n2.  He makes time for you\n3.  He remembers the little things\n4.  He's protective of you\n5.  He lets you into his private world\n6.  He compliments you\n7.  He shares his vulnerabilities\n8.  He's willing to work on communication\n9.  He apologizes and makes things right\n10.

Be prepared to walk away\n\n**Takeaways**\n\nNavigating a relationship with an emotionally unavailable man can feel like piecing together a puzzle, one hint at a time. While he might not express his feelings in the ways you're used to, love can still shine through in the small, significant ways he shows up for you. By recognizing the signs, you may get a glimpse of his true feelings, even if he's not ready to say the words out loud. However, it's essential to remember that healthy relationships require open communication and emotional intimacy. If you find yourself in a relationship where your needs aren't being met, prioritize your own well-being and consider whether the person is really the one for you. 1\\.

Think of those movie scenes where two people lock eyes across a dance floor, and they're immediately drawn to each other.\n\n1\\. Benefits of Spontaneous Sexual Desire Style\n   *   A strong connection to your body.\n   *   You know immediately when you're turned on, which can feel energizing, flirty, and unpredictable.\n\n2\\. Challenges of Spontaneous Sexual Desire Style\n   *   When your partner isn't on the same page with you sexually, abruptly pumping the brakes and leaving you both confused.\n   *   Slowing your desire down can lead to misunderstandings and a sense of rejection that your partner isn't there yet.\n\n**Responsive Sexual Desire Style**\n\nResponsive sexual desire is the type of attraction that kicks in once intimacy unfolds. Physical intimacy and foreplay are needed to turn on the desire.\n\n1\\. Benefits of Responsive Sexual Desire Style\n   *   The pace is slower, but the build-up can be delicious as you use kissing, foreplay, and whatever gets you hot to transition into sex.\n   *   A person has no biological urge or sexual thoughts or fantasies, but something happened that caused them to at least consider the possibility of having sex.\n\n2\\. Challenges of Responsive Sexual Desire Style\n   *   When a partner looks for ardent enthusiasm and misinterprets a lack of initiation as a lack of attraction.\n   *   This can mistakenly create feelings of insecurity, confusion, and frustration, as the anticipation may become a barrier rather than an exciting part of the experience.\n\n**Context-Dependent Sexual Style**\n\nSome people predominantly identify with one type, others blend both styles together. Personally, I identify with a context-dependent sexual desire-I oscillate between both styles.\n\n1\\. Benefits of Context-Dependent Sexual Style\n   *   A flexible approach to the bedroom.\n   *   Since you can toggle between both styles, there's potential for varied sexual experiences based on your mood, how you're feeling in the relationship, and the environment you're in.\n\n2\\. Challenges of Context-Dependent Sexual Style\n   *   The inconsistency may prove to be a challenge, where certain conditions change how you respond to sex.\n   *   Arousal can fluctuate and subsequently, impact cues of desire on any given day.\n\n**How to Embrace Your Sexual Desire Style**\n\n*   Being mindfully present is one way to enhance this sexual desire style. As you relax and connect with your breath, you are engaged with your body and may feel more primed to embrace a spontaneous sexual desire.\n*   Focusing on your partner's emotional state helps too. Are they open to intimacy tonight-and if so, what do they need to get into the mood?\n*   Setting the right ambiance can prime you and your partner for intimacy. Try This That can look like cuddling in a cozy room with dim lighting, and your favorite TV show on.\n*   Similarly to the responsive sexual style, playful, non-sexual touch without the expectation of sex can help you get more in the mood.\n\n**Biology and Psychological Factors Affect Your Sexual Desire Style**\n\nYour sexual desire-and your desire style-is impacted by many factors. Javaid emphasizes that the hormones in our biology,2 along with social influences like our upbringing, media exposure, religion, and friends, all play a big role in shaping how we view sexuality.\n\n1\\. Biological Factors\n   *   The hormones in our biology.\n   *   On top of that, psychological factors like mental health, the quality of our relationships, and our self-esteem are also important.\n\n2\\. Psychological Factors\n   *   Mental health.\n   *   The quality of our relationships.\n   *   Our self-esteem.\n\n**How to Embrace and Communicate Your Sexual Desire Style**\n\nThere is no right or wrong way to experience desire. Knowing which style your body likes helps reduce internal and external conflict. You know what gets you off and you can now confidently express that without judgment or shame. Everyone has a different relationship to sex. Embrace what's best for you.\n\n1\\. Communicate Your Needs\n   *   Open communication is always crucial, and being gentle with oneself while shifting one's understanding is a good idea.\n   *   If a person is still struggling or having difficulty understanding what is happening, they may want to seek out professional help from a sex therapist. Expert-Vetted: Our Picks for the Best Online Sex Therapy Services of 2024\n\n2\\. Keep In Mind\n   *   Understanding your unique sexual desire style leads to deeper self-awareness and satisfaction.\n   *   By openly sharing your needs with your partner, you forge an intimate bond that honors both your authentic desires. Exploring these dynamics becomes a powerful step toward a fulfilling and vibrant sexual relationship.\n\n3\\.

The Biology and Psychology of Addiction: New Insights and Therapeutic Strategies for the Treatment of Substance Use Disorders, 2022. *   **Addiction** is a complex disorder characterized by compulsive use of substances or activities that trigger our reward systems despite experiencing adverse consequences.\n*   A person's genes and environment influence this condition.\n\n**Understanding Addiction**\n\nAddiction is widely viewed as a brain disease due to how it impacts the brain's reward, pleasure, and self-control circuits.\n\n*   In the past, addiction was thought to only encompass substance abuse, but the definition has been expanded to include activities like gambling, gaming, shopping, and exercise.\n*   It's also important to note that addiction is about the underlying neurology of the brain and not about the outward behaviors.\n\n**Causes of Addiction**\n\nPeople engage in potentially addictive activities to feel pleasure, and over time, the reinforcing effect of these activities may change brain chemistry to create an unconscious drive to continue the behavior.\n\n*   Multiple factors influence this process, including genetics, diet, mental health, past traumas, pain, stress, and stage of life.\n*   Genetics account for about half of a person's risk for developing an addiction.\n\n**Breaking an Addiction**\n\nThe first step in overcoming addiction is to desire change and avoid the people, places, and things that promote the addiction.\n\n*   Support groups, mentors, and 12-step programs provide help while counselors, recovery centers, and physicians provide expertise and medication to treat cravings and the effects of withdrawal.\n*   Eating healthy and getting exercise also play an important role in recovery.\n\n**Key Terms**\n\n*   **Substance Use Disorder**: a psychiatric condition that involves the compulsion to use a drug or alcohol despite the development of adverse consequences.\n*   **Behavioral Addiction**: occurs when a pleasurable activity changes the brain and drives a person to engage compulsively in the activity despite harmful consequences.\n*   **Intervention**: an organized attempt by family members or friends to confront a loved one about how their addictive behavior has affected them.\n*   **Comorbidity**: refers to the presence of more than one distinct condition in an individual. 2., 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1, 7.1, 8.1, 9.1, 10.1, 11.1, 12.1, 13.1, 14.1, 15.1, 16.1, 17.1, 18.1, 19.1, 20.1, 21.1, 22.1, 23.1, 24., 25., 26., 27., 28., 29.1, 30., 31., 32.1, 33.1, 34.1, 35.1, 36.1, 37.1, 38.1, 39., 40.1, 41.1, 42.1, 43.1, 44.1, 45.1, 46.1, 47.1, 48., 49.1, 50., 51.1, 52.1, 53.1, 54.1, 55.1, 56.1, 57.1, 58.1, 59.1, 60., 61., 62.1, 63.1, 64.1, 65.1, 66.1, 67.1, 68.1, 69.1, 70., 71.1, 72.1, 73.1, 74.1, 75.1, 76.1, 77.1, 78.1, 79.1, 80., 81.1, 82.1, 83.1, 84.1, 85.1, 86.1, 87.1, 88., 89.1, 90., 91.1, 92., 93.1, 94., 95.1, 96.1, 97.1, 98.1, 99.1, 100.1, 101.1, 102.1, 103.1, 104.1, 105.1, 106.1, 107.1, 108.1, 109., 110.1, 111.1, 112.1, 113.1, 114.1, 115.1, 116.1, 117.1, 118.1, 119.1, 120., 121.1, 122.1, 123.1, 124.1, 125.1, 126.1, 127.1, 128.1, 129.1, 130., 131.1, 132.1, 133.1, 134.1, 135.1, 136.1, 137.1, 138.1, 139.1, 140., 141.1, 142.1, 143.1, 144.1, 145.1, 146.1, 147.1, 148.1, 149.1, 150.1, 151.1, 152.1, 153.1, 154.1, 155.1, 156.1, 157., 158.1, 159.1, 160., 161.1, 162.1, 163.1, 164.1, 165.1, 166.1, 167.1, 168.1, 169.1, 170., 171.1, 172.1, 173.1, 174.1, 175.1, 176.1, 177.1, 178.1, 179.1, 180., 181.1, 182.1, 183.1, 184.1, 185.1, 186.1, 187.1, 188.1, 189.1, 190., 191.1, 192.1, 193.1, 194.1, 195.1, 196.1, 197.1, 198.1, 199.1, 200., 201.1, 202.1, 203.1, 204.1, 205.1, 206.1, 207.1, 208.1, 209.1, 210., 211.1, 212.1, 213.1, 214.1, 215.1, 216.1, 217.1, 218.1, 219.1, 220., 221.1, 222.1, 223.1, 224.1", "category": "general"},

The Best, Most Affordable Online Couples Therapy, According to a Therapist These services offer convenient, empathetic support for couples of all kinds\n\nBy Hannah Owens, LMSW Updated on May 15, 2025\n\n**Our Top Picks**\n\nRegain Online-Therapy.com Talkspace See More (2) Growing Self Modern Intimacy\n\n**What to Expect from Online Couples Counseling**\n\nHow much does it cost? Counseling services can range from $75 to $450 per session or more. Some companies offer subscriptions for less than $500 per month.\n\nWho is it for? Couples, people in relationships, and individuals who want to work on their relationships independently.\n\nWill insurance cover it? Usually, couples therapy is not covered by insurance, but this also depends on the company and whether one of the people in couples therapy has a mental health diagnosis that is being treated.\n\nHow do we meet? Many online couples therapy companies offer weekly sessions via video chat, phone, or text. In many cases, you and your partner can join the session from different devices.\n\nIs it confidential? Be sure to read through any company's privacy policy to better understand whether it is HIPAA-compliant (HIPAA is the law that protects personal health information) and whether it shares any private information with third parties; we recommend opting out of data collection.\n\nWhat's the time commitment? You and your partner might find that you can work out your issues in a number of weeks, while other couples might need months or even years in therapy. As for how long you'll spend in each session, the companies on this list offer sessions from 30 to 50 minutes each.\n\nDoes it work? Couples therapy, even online couples therapy in particular, has been proven effective, but you'll only get out what you put in. If you come to therapy ready to do the work, you're more likely to see success.\n\n**How I Review Online Therapy Services**\n\nI've spent three years testing and surveying real therapy users and reviewing their experiences to help rate and share the best online therapy services. You can see a full breakdown of our online therapy research and testing process on Verywell Mind, but here is an overview of how I capture and evaluate firsthand experience and survey data.\n\nFirsthand Experience\n\nI had 65 different people sign up for talk therapy with all 55 online therapy companies reviewed. Over the past three years, I've published 153 reviews (here are our reviews for BetterHelp and Talkspace, for instance). I had my testers try out each company's therapy services, and if the company offered other services (like couples therapy and kid or teen therapy) we tested those too.\n\nI asked each tester to try each service for at least a month, which usually meant between two and six sessions at each company. I also asked testers to switch therapists partway through, if possible, in order to get a holistic idea of the offerings and quality of each company. My testers were located all across the United States and abroad, meaning I gained extensive information about each company's services in a variety of areas.\n\nUser Surveys\n\nI surveyed more than 8,000 therapy clients who are currently using one of the 55 online therapy companies tested or who had used one in the recent past. I collected 350 different data points in which I asked users to evaluate each company's services, from their therapist's qualifications to whether they found a therapist who met all their needs to how they'd rate the company overall.\n\n**How Do You Know If You Need Couples Therapy?**\n\nIf you are having trouble communicating with your partner, if you find yourselves fighting a lot, or if you are disagreeing about important aspects of your lives, these are all great reasons to try out couples therapy. Working with a couples therapist can help strengthen your relationship by improving the way you talk to and interact with each other, practicing better ways of solving problems, and really delving into the issues that are repeatedly arising in the relationship.\n\nBut couples therapy isn't just for people whose relationships are on the rocks. Going to couples therapy can help even the strongest of couples understand each other better and get ahead of problems that might crop up down the road. It's a great way to practice good communication and make sure that you and your partner are doing-and will continue to do-the best things for your relationship.\n\n**Paying for Online Couples Therapy**\n\nSome online therapy companies who provide couples therapy operate as subscriptions-you pay a certain amount monthly for a certain number of sessions in that month. Other companies are pay-per-session. The amount you pay might be fixed, or might differ depending on your location or the qualifications of your therapist.\n\nIt's important to note that couples therapy is generally not covered by insurance, because it is usually not considered a necessary service. However, if one or both of you have a diagnosed mental health condition, you might be able to use your insurance to pay for your online couples therapy sessions.\n\n**Why Trust Verywell Mind**\n\nHannah Owens is Verywell Mind's Mental Health Editor.

These are some practical strategies that can help you manage and nurture a large household:\n\n1.  Maintain consistent routines.\n2.  Share calendars.\n3.  Assign chores.\n4.  Catch up one-on-one.\n5.  Plan family activities.\n6.  Honor family traditions.\n7.  Celebrate special occasions.\n8.  Hold family meetings.\n9.  Foster open dialogue.\n10. Establish consistent rules.\n11. Encourage self-sufficiency.\n12. Be flexible.\n13. Promote healthy habits.\n14. Engage the whole family in collaborative projects.\n15. Emphasize support.\n\n**Coping Strategies for Children Who Grew up in Big Families**\n\nIf you grew up among the chaos of a large family, these are some coping strategies that might be helpful:\n\n1.  Acknowledge your experiences.\n2.  Validate your feelings.\n3.  Set boundaries.\n4.  Communicate honestly.\n5.  Explore your hobbies.\n6.  Balance your interests.\n7.  Prioritize self-care.\n8.  Carve out personal space.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\nA large family can be loving, fun, noisy, chaotic, and difficult, all at the same time. Chances are, you'll pick up some important life skills and learn to navigate different types of relationships from a very young age. However, there may be times when you feel neglected, overlooked, or slighted. Setting boundaries with loved ones, prioritizing your needs, and practicing self-care can help you cope. However, if you're struggling, it may be helpful to see a therapist or counselor. They can help you understand how the family dynamics you grew up with are affecting your present life and teach you how to form healthier habits and relationships.  - **How Growing Up in a Big Family Shapes Your Development** - **Characteristics of Children in Big Families**\n\n*   Communication: Children in large families often develop excellent communication skills early on, as they frequently interact with family members of various ages.\n*   Sociability: Having many family members means that there are more people coming and going through the cycles of life. Children learn to navigate relationships with other members of the family and develop strong social skills as a result.\n*   Collaboration: Big families tend to require members to work together to achieve common goals, such as making dinner, planning birthday parties, or even sharing the bathroom so everyone can get to school work on time.\n*   Conflict resolution: Children have to learn to share, compromise, and negotiate with multiple siblings for resources, time, and space, which can help them develop strong conflict resolution skills.\n*   Self-reliance: With their parents' time and attention divided among multiple family members, kids often learn to be more self-reliant.\n*   Adaptability: Living in a dynamic environment with various personalities, preferences, and schedules tends to teach children to be flexible and adaptable.\n*   Responsibility: Children often have to help out with household chores from a young age, fostering a sense of duty and responsibility.\n*   Patience: Children often have to wait their turn, which can help them learn that immediate gratification isn't always possible.\n*   Resourcefulness: Children who grow up in big families learn to adapt to strained resources-both financial and emotional.\n*   Resilience: Children often develop thicker skin, becoming adept at managing stress and coping with setbacks.\n*   Playfulness: Big families often have a lively, playful atmosphere, fostering a good sense of humor and a love for fun.\n*   Support: Big families often experience deep, lifelong bonds and a strong sense of support and belonging.\n*   Competitiveness: Growing up with many siblings can instill a sense of competition among children. More family members can mean less direct access to parents but it can also mean learning to grow and work with other family members. Reduced parental guidance can teach children independence, patience, leadership, and collaboration.\n\n**Impact of Big Families on Personality Development**\n\nGrowing up in a big family can vary widely depending on factors such as the emotional capability of parents, the presence and involvement of grandparents or other relatives, the age gap between siblings, and the availability of help support.\n\n*   If children are able to form a secure identity that is bonded to the safety of a solid parental foundation, they may develop a strong sense of self.\n*   However, if children lack parental security while growing up and get lost in the numbers, it may shake the foundation of trust and bonding that is required to form a strong sense of self.\n\n**Practical Strategies for Raising Children in Big Families**\n\nRaising kids in a big family can be both rewarding and challenging. These are some practical strategies that can help you manage and nurture a large household:\n\n1.  Maintain consistent routines.\n2.  Share calendars.\n3.  Assign chores.\n4.  Catch up one-on-one.\n5.  Plan family activities.\n6.  Honor family traditions.\n7.  Celebrate special occasions.\n8.  Hold family meetings.\n9.  Foster open dialogue.\n10. Establish consistent rules.\n11. Encourage self-sufficiency.\n12. Be flexible.\n13. Promote healthy habits.\n14. Engage the whole family in collaborative projects.\n15. Emphasize support.\n\n**Coping Strategies for Children Who Grew up in Big Families**\n\nIf you grew up among the chaos of a large family, these are some coping strategies that might be helpful:\n\n1.  Acknowledge your experiences.\n2.  Validate your feelings.\n3.  Set boundaries.\n4.  Communicate honestly.\n5.  Explore your hobbies.\n6.  Balance your interests.\n7.  Prioritize self-care.\n8.  Carve out personal space.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\nA large family can be loving, fun, noisy, chaotic, and difficult, all at the same time. Chances are, you'll pick up some important life skills and learn to navigate different types of relationships from a very young age. However, there may be times when you feel neglected, overlooked, or slighted. Setting boundaries with loved ones, prioritizing your needs, and practicing self-care can help you cope. However, if you're struggling, it may be helpful to see a therapist or counselor. They can help you understand how the family dynamics you grew up", "category": "general"},

However, it's essential to reflect on the primary issues that caused the breakup and whether they have been resolved.\n\n1. What primary issues caused the breakup, and have they been resolved?\n2. Am I romanticizing the past and overlooking glaring issues?\n3. Have I spent enough time nurturing myself and my own growth?\n\n**Signs It Might Make Sense to Get Back With Your Ex**\n\n*   Abuse was or is present (physical, emotional, verbal, financial)\n*   There's a substance abuse issue (active treatment and resolution should come first)\n*   Little to no changes have been made by one or both\n*   Important life goals and values remain fundamentally different and unaligned\n*   You're feeling lonely wistful versus seeing genuine potential in the partnership\n\n**Signs It Might Not Make Sense to Get Back With Your Ex**\n\n*   Timing was an issue and circumstances have changed\n*   Personal growth, reflection, and changes in behavior have occurred with both parties\n*   Both parties are equally working on the relationship with a shared interest, commitment, and effort\n*   You've aligned on short and long-term life goals\n*   Your communication patterns have improved\n\n**What to Ask Yourself Before Getting Back With An Ex**\n\n1. What do I consider the core components of a healthy relationship?\n2. Can I find this in my former partner?\n3. What do I admire most about who my ex is right now?\n4. How is this person showing up in our dynamic and in their life in general? Do I respect it?\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Ex Before Getting Together Again**\n\n1. Why do you want to be with me right now?\n2. Is our desire to get back together mutual, and are we both willing to put in an equal amount of effort?\n3. What does being with me bring out in you that is positive and that can be challenging?\n4. What have you learned from mistakes made and how can you better engage in a relationship with me? 5. How are we going to address the issues we faced in the past differently than we have before?\n6. Can we acknowledge that our first relationship is over, and are you willing to start a new one with me?\n\n**Conclusion**\nRekindling a relationship with an ex can be challenging, but it's essential to reflect on the primary issues that caused the breakup and whether they have been resolved. Asking yourself and your ex these questions will help you gain greater clarity and confidence in making this decision. Only you can both know what is truly best for yourself, so take as much time as you need to make this decision. Whether you decide to move forward together or continue your separate ways, honestly reflecting and communicating with intention will help you navigate the complexities of rekindling a relationship with an ex. 3 Sources\n\n1.

Codependency in the Family of an Addicted Person. 2. National Library of Medicine. (n.d.). The role of empathy in codependent relationships.\n \n**How to Spot the Signs of Codependency**\n\nCodependency refers to an imbalanced relationship pattern where one person assumes responsibility for meeting another person's needs to the exclusion of acknowledging their own needs or feelings.\n\n**Causes**\n\n*   Biological: The prefrontal cortex part of a codependent person's brain may fail to suppress empathic responses, creating an overabundance of empathy.\n*   Psychological: People who are codependent may be psychologically predisposed to care for others and affected by negative life experiences, such as growing up with parents who fought a lot or being a victim of neglect or emotional abuse.\n*   Social: Codependency may result from changes in how society views women's roles or the increased exposure of substance abuse within family units.\n\n**Signs**\n\n1.  Having a sense of walking on eggshells to avoid conflict with the other person\n2.  Feeling the need to check in with the other person and ask permission to do daily tasks\n3.  Often being the one who apologizes-even if you have done nothing wrong\n4.  Feeling sorry for the other person, even when they hurt you\n5.  Regularly trying to change or rescue troubled, addicted, or under-functioning people whose problems go beyond one person's ability to fix\n6.  Doing anything for the other person, even if it makes you feel uncomfortable\n7.  Putting the other person on a pedestal, despite the fact that they don't merit this position\n8.  A need for other people to like you in order to feel good about yourself\n9.  Struggling to find any time for yourself, especially if your free time consistently goes to the other person\n10. Feeling as if you've lost a sense of yourself within the relationship\n\n**Why It's Unhealthy**\n\n*   Responsibility for relationships with others needs to coexist with responsibility to self.\n*   Codependency can lead to an unhealthy dynamic where one person loses their true sense of self since they're pouring so much into the other person.\n*   Codependency can be difficult to remove oneself from a relationship since one may feel the other person relies on them.\n\n**How to Overcome**\n\n1.  Focus on self-awareness\n2.  Seek therapy to help unravel codependent tendencies\n3.  Become the president of your own fan club by learning to speak lovingly and positively to yourself\n4.  Take small steps toward separation in the relationship\n5.  Seek activities outside of the relationship and invest in new friendships\n6.  Focus on figuring out what makes you who you are, then expand upon them\n7.  Actively turn your attention inward when tempted to think or worry about someone else\n8.  Stand up for yourself if someone criticizes, undermines, or tries to control you\n9.  Consider trying a support group or group psychotherapy\n\n**Takeaway**\n\nCodependency comes in many forms and levels of intensity and often leads to an unhealthy relationship dynamic that progressively gets worse over time as the codependent person loses a sense of themselves. Recognizing the signs of codependency is the first step, then self-awareness and active redirection are key in reducing your codependent tendencies. Be kind to yourself as you work through the process, undoing years of this learned behavior.  <hr/> \n\n**References**\n\n1\\. National Institute of Mental Health. (2020).

We're here to support you.\n\n**The Dos and Don'ts of Double Texting**\n\n**What Is Double Texting, Exactly?**\nDouble texting is when we send someone a second (or sometimes even a third, fourth, or fifth) text message before they've replied to our previous one.\n\n*   Examples of double texting:\n    *   Playful nudge: Just checking in!\n    *   Direct question: Did you get my last message?\n    *   Confirming plans: Hey, just making sure we're still on for later!\n    *   Adding to a previous thought: Oh, and I forgot to mention, tonight's restaurant also has a live band.\n    *   Time-sensitive follow-up: Hey, just wanted to make sure you saw my message about the concert tickets before they sell out!\n    *   Introducing a new conversation topic: I just had the worst Monday.\n    *   Excited overshare: Omg, I just saw something that reminded me of you!\n    *   Playing it cool: [Sending a double text disguised as a meme]\n    *   Passive-aggressive poke: Guess you're busy.\n    *   Argumentative mood: Why are you ignoring me?\n    *   Impatient annoyance: ???\n    *   Emotional response: I'm really upset that you haven't replied. What's going on?\n    *   Stream of multiple messages: Why aren't you responding to me? Do you hate me? Am I not good enough for you?\n\n**Why Do We Double Text?**\nWe double text for a lot of reasons. While some are totally valid, others are driven purely by anxiety.\n\nSome of the reasons for double texting might include:\n\n1.  Following up on something urgent\n2.  Checking if they saw our message\n3.  Clarifying something\n4.  Adding a forgotten detail\n5.  Feeling anxious\n6.  Sharing excitement\n7.  Wanting to keep the conversation going\n8.  Being insecure\n\n**When Is Double Texting Appropriate?**\nDouble texting is totally fine in certain situations-it's all about context, timing, and tone.\n\nHere are some cases where it's appropriate:\n\n1.  When you're apologizing\n2.  When it's time-sensitive\n3.  When you forgot to include important information\n4.  When the conversation naturally calls for it\n5.  When you have a close relationship with the person\n6.  When it's been a reasonable amount of time\n\n**When to Avoid Double Texting?**\nDouble texting isn't always a great idea-sometimes, it can come off as pushy or even a little needy.\n\nHere are some situations where you should probably hold off:\n\n1.  When you know they're busy\n2.  When it's only been a short while\n3.  When it's a new acquaintance\n4.  When they're not reciprocating interest\n5.  When you're feeling anxious\n6.  When it's an argument or a serious conversation\n7.  When they've already seen your message\n8.  When the conversation has ended\n9.  When you've already sent multiple unanswered texts\n10. When it's late at night\n\n**The Negative Consequences of Double Texting**\nDouble texting isn't always a bad thing, but it can backfire if it's overdone.\n\nHere are some potential negative consequences to keep in mind:\n\n1.  Looking desperate\n2.  Pushing people away\n3.  Appearing impatient\n4.  Coming across as passive-aggressive\n5.  Creating misunderstandings\n6.  Lowering your perceived value\n7.  Signaling imbalance\n\n**How to Double Text Considerately**\nDouble texting can be totally fine if it's done considerately.\n\nHere are some tips to help you double text without coming off as pushy, impatient, or needy:\n\n1.  Give it some time: Before sending a second message, pause and ask yourself whether you have given them enough time to respond.\n2.  Keep it casual and friendly: Your follow-up should feel light, not like you're pressuring them.\n3.  Make it quick: Get straight to the point.\n4.  Highlight any urgency: If there's an actual deadline, say so.\n5.  Read the room: Context matters.\n6.  Ask yourself how you would feel: Before you hit send, ask yourself, if the roles were reversed, would this message make you feel comfortable or pressured?\n7.  Know when to let it go: If you've already followed up once and still haven't gotten a response, it's best to leave it alone.\n\n**Alternatives to Double Texting**\nIf you're tempted to send a double text but don't want to come off as pushy, there are plenty of other ways to handle the situation.\n\nHere are some alternatives to consider:\n\n1.  Distract yourself: Sometimes, the best thing to do is... nothing.\n2.  Send a meme or an inside joke: If your first message wasn't urgent but you still want to nudge the conversation along, send something fun-like a meme, GIF, or a callback to a previous joke.\n3.  Start a new conversation: If your last message didn't get a response, maybe it wasn't the right topic.\n4.  Call if it's important: If it's actually urgent, a quick phone call can save you from the awkwardness of multiple unanswered texts.\n\n**Takeaways**\nDouble texting isn't inherently bad-it all comes down to how and why we do it.\n\nIf it's a casual follow-up, a playful message, or a necessary reminder, it can be totally fine. But when it crosses into pushy, impatient, or anxious territory, it might do more harm than good.\n\nThe key is to read the situation, give the person space, and choose your words wisely. If you're double texting out of excitement or practicality, go for it! But if it's driven by insecurity or a need for validation, it might be worth taking a step back.\n\nIf someone wants to reply to your original message, they will. And if they don't, you have your answer.  - Read more about the art of texting after a first date and what to say when. - Discover how textual compatibility can make or break a relationship. - Learn about the different types of attachment styles and their impact on relationships. - Get expert advice on how to navigate conflicts in relationships. - Find out why being clingy is not always a bad thing, but can be a sign of insecurity.", "category": "general"},

But how much do we actually know about toxicity and abuse? Not just what TikTok or Twitter has told us.\n\n**What Is Toxicity and Abuse?**\n\nNot all toxic relationships are abusive; however, all abusive relationships can be considered toxic. In a toxic relationship, there is usually a lack of respect and a violation of boundaries. Sometimes, this behavior occurs without the person even realizing they're doing it. But, if this kind of behavior is consistently repeated with the active intent to harm the other person, the relationship could be considered abusive.\n\n**Signs of Toxicity and Abuse**\n\nEvery relationship is different and may change over time. A relationship can start out very healthy and slowly turn into something you need to fix (or get out of). And there are some important qualities that tend to characterize unhealthy relationships. These qualities are control, disrespect, poor communication, and lack of trust.\n\n*   Control: When one person in the relationship tries to dominate or manipulate the other.\n*   Disrespect: When one person is consistently belittled, mocked, or disrespected by the other.\n*   Poor Communication: When both partners have difficulty communicating effectively, leading to misunderstandings and hurt feelings.\n*   Lack of Trust: When one or both partners don't feel secure in the relationship due to dishonesty, infidelity, or other issues.\n\n**Types of Abuse**\n\nDomestic abuse can take many forms. These are some of the different types of domestic abuse:\n\n1.  **Physical Abuse:** Physical harm or threats of physical harm.\n2.  **Sexual Abuse:** Forcing someone into unwanted sexual activity or touching.\n3.  **Neglect:** Failing to provide basic needs like food, shelter, or medical care.\n4.  **Emotional or Psychological Abuse:** Using fear, guilt, or manipulation to control the other person.\n5.  **Financial Abuse:** Controlling or restricting access to financial resources.\n6.  **Cultural Identity Abuse:** Targeting someone's cultural identity or background for abuse.\n7.  **Technological Abuse:** Using technology to monitor, track, or control the other person.\n8.  **Immigration Abuse:** Threatening or using immigration status as a form of control.\n\n**Key Terms**\n\n*   **Domestic Abuse:** A pattern of behavior used to hurt, terrorize, manipulate, or gain control over a family member.\n*   **Gaslighting:** A form of emotional abuse that causes someone to doubt their own sanity or reality.\n*   **Narcissism:** A diagnosable personality disorder characterized by grandiosity, lack of empathy, and the chronic need for admiration.\n*   **Reactive Abuse:** When someone who has been abused lashes out at their abuser in return.\n\n**Exploring Toxicity and Abuse**\n\nIf you're concerned about a toxic relationship or experiencing abuse yourself, seek help from a trusted friend, family member, or professional. Resources like support groups, hotlines, and therapy can provide the guidance and safety needed to navigate these complex issues.\n\nSome recommended resources include:\n\n*   National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233)\n*   National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) Helpline (1-800-950-6264)\n*   The National Dating Abuse Helpline (1-866-331-9474)\n\nAlways prioritize your safety and well-being.

Characteristics of Attachment Strange Situation Assessment Attachment Through Life Secure Attachment Style Ambivalent Attachment Style Avoidant Attachment Style Disorganized Attachment Style Take the Attachment Style Quiz 1. Bowlby shared the psychoanalytic view that early experiences in childhood are important for influencing development and behavior later in life. He believed that attachment had an evolutionary component; it aids in survival. He believed that this propensity to make strong emotional bonds with specific individuals was an essential part of human nature. 2. The expectations formed during that period tend to remain relatively unchanged for the rest of the person's life. 3. In other words, children develop expectations that their caregivers will be responsive to their needs because, in their experience, their caregivers have been responsive in the past. 4. Ainsworth's Strange Situation Assessment followed this basic sequence: The parent and child are alone in a room. 5. The study involved observing children between the ages of 12 to 18 months responding to a situation in which they were briefly left alone and then reunited with their mother. 6. Before you start blaming relationship problems on your parents, it is important to note that attachment styles formed during early childhood are not necessarily identical to those demonstrated in adult romantic attachments. 7. In one study, researchers found that parental divorce seemed unrelated to attachment style. 8. Parental divorce or abandonment is linked to more negative feelings about romantic relationships as a higher likelihood of having an anxious and avoidant attachment style. 9. These children can be comforted to some extent by other people in the absence of a parent or caregiver, but they clearly prefer parents to strangers. 10. Mothers who respond inconsistently or who interfere with a child's activities tend to produce infants who explore less, cry more, and are more anxious. 11. Mothers who consistently reject or ignore their infant's needs tend to produce children who try to avoid contact. 12. In a classic study by Hazan and Shaver, 56% of respondents identified themselves as secure, while 25% identified as avoidant, and 19% identified as ambivalent anxious. 13. Ambivalently attached adults report falling in love often. 14. Avoidantly attached adults describe love as rare and temporary. 15. Research has shown that securely attached children are more empathetic during later stages of childhood. 16. These children are also described as less disruptive, less aggressive, and more mature than children with ambivalent or avoidant attachment styles. 17. Hazan and Shaver noted that securely attached adults tend to have trusting, long-term relationships. 18. Securely attached individuals enjoy intimate relationships, seek out social support, and share feelings with other people. 19. Research has also shown that adults with an avoidant attachment style are more accepting and likely to engage in casual sex. 20. Adults with a disorganized attachment style exhibit a confusing mix of anxious and avoidant behaviors in relationships. 21. People with a disorganized style may seek out a loving relationship and then suddenly push the other person away. 22. They often sabotage their relationships and have a hard time trusting their partners.\n\nAction: paraphrase and add Markdown formatting\n\n**Attachment Styles**\n===============\n\nAttachment styles are patterns that emerge in our earliest emotional bonds with caregivers. These early attachment styles play an important role in child development and also influence attachment patterns in adult relationships.\n\n*   Fill half of our plate with colorful vegetables and fruits (and choose them as snacks)\n*   Split the other half between whole grains and healthy protein\n*   The more veggies ‚Äì and the greater the variety ‚Äì the better\n\n**Overview**\n------------\n\nAttachment styles are characterized by different ways of interacting and behaving in relationships. During early childhood, these attachment styles center on how children and parents interact. In adulthood, attachment styles describe attachment patterns in romantic relationships.\n\n*   Securely attached individuals tend to have trusting, long-term relationships.\n*   Ambivalently attached adults report falling in love often.\n*   Avoidantly attached adults describe love as rare and temporary.\n\n**Types of Attachment Styles**\n------------------------------\n\n### **Secure Attachment Style**\n\nChildren who are securely attached generally become visibly upset when their caregivers leave and are happy when their parents return. When frightened, these children will seek comfort from the parent or caregiver.\n\n*   Seek comfort from parents when frightened\n*   Greets return of parents with positive emotions\n*   Prefers parents to strangers\n\n### **Ambivalent Attachment Style**\n\nChildren who are ambivalently attached tend to be extremely suspicious of strangers. These children display considerable distress when separated from a parent or caregiver but do not seem reassured or comforted by the parent's return.\n\n*   May be wary of strangers\n*   Become greatly distressed when parents leave\n*   Do not appear comforted when parents return\n\n### **Avoidant Attachment Style**\n\nChildren with avoidant attachment styles tend to avoid parents and caregivers. This avoidance often becomes especially pronounced after a period of absence.\n\n*   May avoid parents\n*   Do not seek much contact or comfort from parents\n*   Show little or no preference for parents over strangers\n\n### **Disorganized Attachment Style**\n\nChildren with a disorganized-insecure attachment style show a lack of clear attachment behavior. Their actions and responses to caregivers are often a mix of behaviors, including avoidance or resistance.\n\n*   At Age 1: Show a mixture of avoidant and resistant behavior\n*   May seem dazed, confused, or apprehensive\n*   At Age 6: May take on a parental role\n\n**Take the Attachment Style Quiz**\n-----------------------------------\n\nIf you're unsure about your attachment style, this fast and free quiz can help you identify what your thoughts and behaviors may say about your attachment.\n\n1.

Share Your Thoughts Related Articles How to Talk to Your Partner About Their Addiction The Benefits of Having a Morning Routine for Better Mental Health What Are the Effects of Loneliness on Your Body? How to Improve Your Relationship by Being More Present 1.    What does parallel play have to say about your relationship? A secure attachment style means you can hold your partner in your mind and heart when they're elsewhere, trusting that your partner will do the same. This confidence comes from knowing your partner is connected with you even when not directly interacting, which is a strong indicator of a healthy romantic relationship. 2.    What does parallel play say about your attachment style? Parallel play can be indicative of an insecure or anxious attachment style if it causes anxiety or panic due to the fear that your partner might not be constantly available or paying attention to you. If this applies to you, parallel play can actually be a great step forward in addressing these issues by learning to trust your partner's love and care even when they're not directly interacting with you. 3.    What are some potential drawbacks of too much parallel play? Excessive parallel play can lead to isolation from your partner, making it challenging to feel emotionally connected or intimate. It may also result in complacency, causing you and your partner to neglect quality time together, leading to resentment rather than closeness and connection. 4.    What are some signs that too much parallel play might be a problem? If parallel play becomes the default over doing things together, it's a worrisome sign. You might find yourself and your partner only doing separate activities without making an effort to engage in or schedule interactive activities like date nights or physical intimacy together. This can lead to feelings of disconnection and isolation from each other. 5.    How can you strike a balance between parallel play and quality time with your partner? To maintain a healthy balance, make sure to check in on your partner and intentionally plan shared activities that bring you both joy. This will help prevent complacency and ensure that your relationship remains strong and connected. 6.    What are some signs of a secure attachment style? A secure attachment means you can trust your partner's love and care even when they're not directly interacting with you, allowing for comfortable silence and confidence in the strength of your relationship. This is a key component of parallel play and a sign of a healthy romantic relationship. 7.    What are some potential benefits of parallel play? Parallel play can promote secure attachment behaviors by practicing object permanence - trusting that your partner exists and will still be there for you even when not directly interacting. It also allows you to enjoy activities that might not interest or appeal to your partner without feeling guilty or anxious, promoting trust and comfort in the relationship. 8.    How does parallel play relate to attachment styles?

What are some signs that parallel play is becoming too much of a habit?

What are some ways to nurture emotional intimacy in your marriage?

It's an important part of a child's development as it helps develop motor skills, social skills, confidence, independence, and expression.\n\n*   Parallel play can also occur in adult relationships.\n*   It can be beneficial for neurodivergent folks.\n*   Ever find yourself plopped on the couch and scrolling social media while you're sitting next to your partner who is watching TV? That's parallel play‚Äîa way to feel together even when you are having separate experiences.\n\n**Benefits of Parallel Play**\n\nParallel play helps practice a version of object permanence, trusting that your partner exists and will still be there for you and love you even when they are not paying direct attention to you. This kind of security can greatly benefit a romantic relationship by allowing you to trust your partner's love and care even when they're not directly interacting with you.\n\n*   Parallel play lets your partner know that you trust them and are confident in their love and care of you.\n*   It allows you to still enjoy activities that might not interest or appeal to your partner without feeling guilty or anxious.\n*   This is about trust; trusting that your partner will be able to take care of themselves while you are doing something they don't want to do (or they are doing something you don't want to do).\n\n**Drawbacks of Parallel Play**\n\nIf parallel play becomes the default over doing things together, it can hurt the relationship. You might find that you've gotten complacent and no longer try to engage in or schedule interactive activities like date nights or physical intimacy together.\n\n*   Excessive parallel play can lead to isolation from your partner.\n*   It may also result in complacency, causing you and your partner to neglect quality time together, leading to resentment rather than closeness and connection.\n\n**What Does Parallel Play Say About Your Relationship?**\n\nParallel play can be indicative of a strong relationship because it practices secure attachment behaviors. This is the adult version of object permanence-being able to hold your partner in your mind and your heart when they are physically or emotionally elsewhere, and trusting that your partner will do the same.\n\n*   A secure attachment means you can have confidence in the strength of your relationship without needing constant reminders and reassurance that your partner wants, needs, and loves you.\n*   Parallel play lets your partner know that you trust them and are confident in their love and care of you even when they're not directly interacting with you. \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nWhile there are both good and bad things about parallel play, as with most things, balance is key. Parallel play can be the sign of a strong, healthy relationship, but too much of it can leave you feeling isolated from your partner. So don't worry if you find yourself and your partner sitting on the couch together doing different things‚Äîjust make sure it's not all you do!

craving narcissistic supply\n    *   A sense of entitlement\n    *   Interpersonally exploitative behavior\n    *   A lack of empathy\n    *   Envy of others or a belief that others are envious of him or her\n    *   A demonstration of arrogant and haughty behaviors or attitudes\n\n**Signs You're in a Narcissistic Marriage or Relationship**\n\nLet's take a look at some behaviors that someone with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) may present.\n\n1.  **History of Narcissistic Personality Disorder**\n    *   Your partner talks with you when it is convenient, but they have never actually asked what your plans are for the future or how you can work together to build the life you want.\n    *   They constantly brag about themselves and their accomplishments and rarely show interest or ask questions about anything going on in your life.\n2.  **You Don't Feel Connected**\n    *   Your partner's happiness comes from external sources such as prestige at work and money.\n    *   You wonder if they are even capable of feeling romantic love or emotional connection.\n3.  **You Feel Manipulated**\n    *   Your partner will make subtle threats throughout the relationship.\n    *   They may not be direct with their words, but you'll get a sense that if you don't do something for them or give in to what they want, bad things will happen.\n4.  **You Don't Feel Good Enough**\n    *   You have feelings of inadequacy that don't match what you've accomplished in your life.\n    *   Your partner tends to put you down or make negative comments about the things that you do.\n5.  **You're Constantly Being Gaslighted**\n    *   When someone constantly denies things that you know to be true, they are gaslighting you.\n    *   This is often seen in abusive or controlling relationships and is a common tactic among narcissists.\n6.  **You Avoid Conversations**\n    *   It may seem as though every conversation with your partner ends in an argument no matter how hard you try to stay calm and not get upset by what they say or do.\n    *   The narcissist constantly tries to push your buttons to get you to react; controlling others' emotions gives them a sense of satisfaction.\n7.  **You Feel Responsible for Everything**\n    *   Narcissists think that everything is always someone else's fault, including the things that they do wrong.\n    *   You won't get an apology from a narcissistic person.\n8.  **You're Walking on Eggshells**\n    *   Do you feel as though you're walking on eggshells because you never know when your partner is going to explode or be in one of their moods?\n    *   Everything seems fine, but then something minor happens and they go into a rage.\n9.  **You See Through the Charm**\n    *   On the surface, your partner is charming, confident, and accomplished.\n    *   However, they seem this way only because they are so skillful at hiding their true colors when in public.\n10. **You Feel Criticized Constantly**\n    *   Your partner is excessively critical of your appearance.\n    *   They might make comments about your weight, clothes, or choice of hairstyle.\n11. **Your Needs Are Ignored**\n    *   Your partner thinks only about their own needs and how things affect them, not you or anyone else-including the kids if you have a family.\n12. **Your Family Is Warning You (or Is Oblivious)**\n    *   Your family has told you that they don't like how your partner treats you.\n    *   Or, your family is oblivious that anything is wrong because your partner has been feeding them lies about you.\n13. **You've Been Cheated On**\n    *   A narcissist is often a master flirt and might be cheating on you.\n14. **You Feel Unloved**\n    *   When you first got together, you felt like the most amazing person in the world.\n    *   However, as time went on and problems arose, your partner began to devalue and ignore you.\n15. **You Get the Silent Treatment**\n    *   Your partner uses the silent treatment as a power play to control you.\n16. **You're Stuck Financially**\n    *   If there's one thing that narcissists know how to do well, it's to take advantage of their spouses financially.\n17. **You Can't Rely on Your Partner**\n    *   When they make promises, you never know if they're going to keep them.\n\n**What to Do If You're in a Relationship With a Narcissist**\n\nBeing in a relationship with a narcissist can have significant, long-lasting effects on your mental health. If your partner is emotionally abusive and unwilling to change their behavior, it's time for you to reconsider the relationship. And if you decide to leave it, have a support system in place beforehand-people you trust enough to confide in.\n\nIf you continue your relationship with the narcissist:\n\n*   Seek therapy or outside support\n*   Create and maintain boundaries\n*   Keep records of conversations, events, etc. to ward off gaslighting\n*   Try to remain calm and assertive\n*   At work, resist gossip, even though you might need to vent\n*   Learn all you can about narcissism so you can recognize their tactics and manipulation\n\n**Get Help Now**\n\nWe've tried, tested, and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy", "category": "general"},

This can happen due to various factors such as changes in relationships, increased self-awareness, learning new skills, or experiencing trauma.\n\n### Factors Influencing Attachment Style Change\n------------------------------------------------\n\nSeveral factors can influence attachment style change:\n\n*   **Relationships**: Transitions from safe and healthy relationships to unsafe and inconsistent ones or vice versa can play a key role in influencing style change.\n*   **Self-awareness**: Recognizing that old attachment injuries have led to insecure attachments is necessary for anyone seeking intentional change.\n*   **Learning skills**: Being able to learn to communicate effectively, identify emotions, tolerate uncomfortable feelings, and develop emotional regulation skills is important for anyone trying to change their attachment style.\n*   **Trauma**: Trauma can change attachment styles, and self-awareness can help shield someone with a secure attachment from this impact.\n\n### Research on Attachment Style Change\n------------------------------------------\n\nThere are various studies on changes in attachment style. The Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaptation is one such study that has shown the importance of stressors across time leading to changes in individuals' attachment styles.\n\n### How to Change Your Attachment Style\n-----------------------------------------\n\nChanging your attachment style from one of the three insecure styles to earned secure attachment can be challenging. Both Goldberg and Kivett agree that the first step is to understand your current attachment style and the behaviors that go with it. Once you're aware of the behaviors you'd like to change, you can begin to do so.\n\n### Challenges and Limitations of Attachment Style Change\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nAttachment style is often deeply ingrained since childhood, and therefore, difficult to change. This can lead to challenges when you try to change your attachment style:\n\n*   You may feel that your insecure attachment style is valid.\n*   You may have a tendency to choose relationships similar to caregivers that will perpetuate the cycle of insecure attachment.\n*   Changing an attachment style requires consistent effort, patience, and self-awareness.\n\n### Wrapping Up\n----------------\n\nOur attachment style can change. In fact, we can even experience different attachment styles with different people depending on how they treat us and how we interact. It is possible to go from an insecure to an earned secure style of attachment as long as we have self-compassion and surround ourselves with positive, secure people.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.  van Ryzin, G., Carlson, E.

A tenured friend is someone you've known for many years, perhaps stemming back to your childhood or even collegiate years. They've been with you across all iterations of yourself, witnessed some of your best and worst moments, stuck with you through thick and thin, and will continue to remain by your side for years to come. Maybe it is the friend who walked with you on your first day of kindergarten and held your hand because you were scared. Or maybe it's your college roommate who knows what you did at that wild party, at many wild parties-but will never, ever tell, says mental health counselor Naomi Angoff Chedd, LMHC. You can stay up talking until sunrise or sit in silence with this friend and feel perfectly content, either way. A New Tenured Friend A tenured friend doesn't necessarily need to have a decades-long history. Sometimes, tenured friends are newer friendships that have been cemented by hours of deep bonding over a short period of time. This could be a new friend who you instantly clicked with, someone who you naturally spend a lot of time with for work or life purposes, or a person you might have traveled with or experienced something with that bonded you in a unique way. Best of all, the two of you never need to question your love, your trust, and your commitment to each other. A tenured friend is also someone you may not see or talk to every day-you may even live thousands of miles apart-but when you pick up the phone or get to spend time together, it's like no time has passed. Maybe it is the friend who walked with you on your first day of kindergarten and held your hand because you were scared. Or maybe it's your college roommate who knows what you did at that wild party, at many wild parties-but will never, ever tell. - NAOMI ANGOFF CHEDD, LMHC The Benefits of Having Tenured Friends The benefits of having tenured friendships are immeasurable. This is someone who's always in your corner, who knows the deepest parts of you, and who you can rely on no matter what life throws your way. As a therapist, Jessica Montague, LCSW, sees first-hand the value of people having multiple deep, meaningful relationships in their lives. Robin Dunbar's foundational research in the '90s showed us that we only need a few great friendships-five was his number-in order to be happy. Research has also suggested that three is enough to lead a fulfilling life. 1 Research tells us that friends provide important emotional support that contributes to overall happiness and well-being and can also help us manage our stress levels.23 Science has also shown that having meaningful friendships can positively impact our physical health since isolation and loneliness are linked with a variety of health issues.4 6 Benefits of Friendship and Why It's So Important to Stay Close 5 Key Signs of a Tenured Friend So how do you know if you've got a tenured friend? Look for these key signs. There's a Sense of Safety & Support Tenured friendships are healthy relationships that provide us with a sense of long-term safety and reliability, Montague says. You can tell this person anything, they feel free to share with you, and you're both there for each other with love, acceptance, and support. You Know Each Other Extremely Well Another characteristic of tenured friendships is that you really see, hear, and deeply know the other person. If time passes and you haven't been in touch, you pick up where you left off, as though very little time had passed, Montague says. You're privy to each other's secrets and embarrassing moments, greatest joys, life woes, major milestones, and so much more. You're Excited to Update Them on Your Life Even if you don't talk every day, a tenured friend is someone who often has a first-row seat in your life. You're eager to share big news with them and they're one of the first people you reach out to when something's gone wrong. Montague says, Big career changes, relationship issues, raising kids, whatever-you keep it real, and you stay open to each other. Big career changes, relationship issues, raising kids, whatever-you keep it real, and you stay open to each other. - JESSICA MONTAGUE, LCSW Your Friendship is Flexible In a good tenured friendship, you can say things like, this season of life, or this person I'm dating right", "category": "general"},

Having close, positive relationships with colleagues is associated with increased well-being in the workplace, which should come as no surprise.1 If you've ever worked in a toxic workplace, which unfortunately many of us have, then you also know the intense toll negative workplace relationships can have. Workplace toxicity not only diminishes employee performance - it can also lead to burnout.2\n\nPart of the nuance of workplace relationships is the delicate balance of boundaries. Within the office, you're colleagues and peers. Outside the office, you may be close friends. Complications can arise when dynamics outside the workplace come into the office. Even in the most loving workplace relationships, when a dear friend and colleague struggles, you may feel hard-pressed for the right words.\n\nYou may have deep empathy and a hunger to support them, but might also be worried about an increased workload or stress being brought onto you. There is a way to maintain your care, connection, and heart in the workplace while respecting the boundaries of the workplace.\n\nHere are 20 ways to support your co-worker through a hard time:\n\n*   Do you want to talk?\n*   Is there any extra support you need?\n*   Would it be helpful if we redistributed our workload?\n*   This is a lot to carry alone.\n*   Do you have a therapist you can talk to?\n*   We love Inclusive Therapists and Open Path Collective.\n*   You deserve support. I can help you find the contact for the Employee Assistance Program.\n*   Do you want to bookend your chat with HR?\n*   Have you considered taking some time off?\n*   I'm worried about you.\n*   Just know I'm here for you.\n*   I see you and all your efforts.\n*   A job isn't worth your well-being.\n*   Want to get together outside of the office to connect?\n*   Let's see what your options are.\n*   Don't feel pressured to share what you're not ready to.\n*   What do you feel comfortable sharing?\n*   I've experienced something similar. Would it be helpful to hear my experience?\n*   Would you like advice or a listening ear?\n*   Your feelings are valid.\n*   Let's consider your options.\n*   You can serve as an unbiased sounding board.\n*   I hear you.\n\n**Sources**\n\n1.

Choosing to live apart together is a deliberate decision where both partners are committed to each other but prefer to maintain separate living spaces.\n\n*   Couples who prefer LAT like maintaining their routines and having personal space as they value their freedom and independence.\n*   It allows each partner to manage their own living environment while enjoying the emotional and physical intimacy of a committed relationship.\n*   The Relationship Doesn't Get Boring\n    *   People participate in the LAT model because it keeps the relationship new and fresh.\n    *   Many people get tired of their partners and feel less excited about them when they're together all the time.\n*   Some Partners Have Their Preferences and Quirks-Which Is OK\n    *   This relationship model is also a fit for other situations, too.\n    *   For example, your job is miles apart from your partner's home and you don't want a long commute to the office.\n\n**Challenges of Living Apart Together**\n\nOf course, the benefits of LAT come with a few challenges, namely social stigma, communication, and emotional distance.\n\n*   Social Stigma\n    *   People may ask them why they're not living together or when they're moving in together.\n    *   Suggest that their relationship must be struggling because they're not living together.\n*   Difficulty Finding Time Together Outside of social stigma, one of the biggest challenges of living apart in relationships is schedule coordination and communication.\n\n**Making LAT Work**\n\nIt takes some work to create a successful LAT relationship-any relationship, really-but it's completely possible. One first step is planning quality time, so the relationship stays connected.\n\n*   Planning dates ahead of time and sending spontaneous text messages (so they know you're thinking of them) are just a few small things to make your partner feel seen and appreciated.\n*   To prevent conflict avoidance, Reed recommends establishing communication and conflict rules on how arguments and discussions will be handled.\n\n**Considerations for Choosing LAT**\n\nThe first way to know if LAT is for you is if you, like me, wanted to live with partners in the past but disliked it. Think of past conflicts you've had in relationships and reflect on how many of them were related to sharing a living space, suggests Weiss.\n\n*   Consider your personal values, lifestyle preferences, and relationship intentionality when deciding to opt in or out of a LAT relationship.\n*   Also, consider the social stigma attached to LAT aka the belief that not living together implies a lack of commitment. If LAT relationships were more normalized, many relationships may actually last longer because the people in them would be less annoyed with each other and would have an easier time keeping the passion alive.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFor neurodivergent folks, people who enjoy their independence and autonomy, or individuals allergic to their partner's pets, LAT is a fine option for keeping and deepening romantic partnerships. It takes work like all relationships do. And yeah, unlike living together, you'll have to make more of an effort to communicate. But if you're happy with a partner, you don't have to live with them, especially if that doesn't sound like a great time. Instead, you can live apart together. I mean-if Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Burton could live apart for their 13-year marriage and still be happy, why can't you?

{"title": "Behold, Your Reason to Date a Golden Retriever Boyfriend", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/golden-retriever-boyfriend-8668663", "content": "on Article\n**Title**\nBehold, Your Reason to Date a Golden Retriever Boyfriend\n\n**Overview**\nHeyl discusses the idealized relationship archetype known as the \"Golden Retriever Boyfriend\" based on TikTok videos and explores its potential benefits and red flags.\n\n*   A Golden Retriever Boyfriend is outgoing, affectionate, and game for anything.\n*   They're also clingy and codependent on your presence to be happy.\n*   This relationship archetype emphasizes the importance of loyalty and a sunny disposition.\n\n**Qualities of a Golden Retriever Boyfriend**\n\n1.  A Golden Retriever Boyfriend is always ready to listen, has a deep sense of loyalty, and a smile that spreads across his face anytime he sees you.\n2.  They're outgoing, easily excited, and are game for doing silly things.\n3.  However, they can be overly clingy and codependent on your presence.\n\n**Benefits of Having a Golden Retriever Boyfriend**\n\n*   You'll have a warm, optimistic, loyal, kind, and appreciative partner.\n*   This relationship archetype emphasizes the importance of loyalty and a sunny disposition.\n\n**Things Aren't Always As They Seem**\n\n1.  Idealization can be problematic when we focus solely on the positive attributes of someone or something, leading us to minimize any negative qualities.\n2.  Nothing is all good nor all bad in relationships; insisting a relationship only has good qualities means overlooking reality.\n3.  This sets us up for disappointment and is unfair to our partner.\n\n**Red Flags to Watch Out for in a Golden Retriever Boyfriend**\n\n1.  If your partner relies only on you for social connection, isolation can occur.\n2.  Guilt tripping you for working, seeing family or friends without him, or focusing all energy on him are red flags.\n3.  The relationship may be consistently focused on being silly and lighthearted, creating issues when there's conflict.\n\n**How to Cultivate Golden Retriever Boyfriend Qualities**\n\n1.  Practice active listening by hearing what your partner is saying rather than just responding.\n2.  Look into each other's love languages and provide love in the preferred language.\n3.  Consider reaching out to a therapist if you're stuck in comparison cycles.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe Golden Retriever Boyfriend archetype can be both beneficial and problematic, highlighting the importance of balance and realistic expectations in relationships. While cultivating its qualities through active listening and love languages can strengthen connections, being aware of potential red flags is essential for maintaining healthy relationships. By understanding the nuances of this idealized relationship archetype, individuals can navigate their own relationships more effectively.

If you have concerns about your relationship or sex life, please consult with a mental health professional.  *This post was medically reviewed by Ivy Kwong, LMFT.* Read the full disclaimer here. **When Reading Smut Bleeds into Real Life**\n\nPerhaps, I've been single for too long (I have), but I often fantasize about book characters and wonder: why can't I have that in real life? These book boyfriends are *literally* killing their enemies to protect their women and meanwhile, I can't get a text back. And I'm not the only one who feels this way. So many BookTokers have made videos comparing the disappointment that is real-life men to fictional characters. And yes, I understand these characters are fictional but what they're doing-being intentional and communicative, showing love and care-is what I want from my partner. Are my expectations too high or am I being delusional and ignoring how IRL dating works?\n\n**What Does Reading Smut Say About Relationships, Dating, and Sex?**\n\nThere's nothing wrong with reading erotica or smut. If anything, it's a form of escapism, says Dr. Hertlein. The growing popularity of romance and erotic novels suggests that more people are enjoying the escapism that comes with getting into these kinds of stories. More people are also eager to learn about their sexual desires, says Dr. Janet Brito, a sex therapist and founder of The Sexual Health School. She credits the popularization of smut to individuals seeking inspiration to improve their own sex lives and the rising interest in different relationship types like polyamory. Even single people like myself who avidly read smut can find value.\n\nResearch shows that consuming sexually explicit content helps people feel more sexually confident with themselves and their bodies.1 I wasn't taught to feel okay with sex and sexual desires, but erotica and smut have become safe spaces for me to explore arousal and excitement with less shame and guilt.\n\n**How to Have a Healthy Sex Life While Reading Smut (Because, Yes, It's Possible)**\n\nSometimes, we readers get swept up in the fantasies. Eyes so glued to the paperback novel that IRL intimacy and sex have become non-existent. While a smut addiction does not exist, according to Dr. Brito, there is such a thing as too much smut, especially if it's beginning to impact your relationships.\n\nIt may become unhealthy if you're neglecting other responsibilities or avoiding engagement in real-life relationships, she says. In other words, if you're forgoing intimacy with your partner because they don't perform like the book boyfriends or are abandoning quality time with your S.O. because you're too focused on the novel, you might need to cut back on the smut.\n\nYou don't have to quit entirely but establishing boundaries could help. To maintain a healthy relationship with erotica without damaging your sexual and romantic relationships, set limits on reading time to ensure it doesn't interfere with quality time with your partner, Dr. Hertlein says. Prioritize real-life intimacy by consciously focusing on physical and emotional connections with your partner over fictional experiences.\n\nAlways reflect on your desire to read erotica, Dr. Hertlein adds. If you're reading smut because you like it, great! But if you find yourself obsessed with the sex or romance in the novel because it's lacking in your own life and preventing you from real-life intimacy, maybe it's time to put the smut reading on pause for reflection and in-person connection.\n\n**So, Does Smut Ruin Dating?**\n\nThe short answer? No. The long answer? Too much smut may create intimacy, dating, and relationship issues. But that's where discernment comes in. Accept that romance and smut books are primarily designed for entertainment, Dr. Brito advises. They often feature characters with ideal qualities and nearly perfect relationships.\n\nWhile they may include elements of real-life scenarios, their main purpose is to entertain you. Certain things like weird and awkward sex or miscommunication just aren't entertaining, so most romance and erotica won't include them. But that doesn't mean they don't happen in real life.\n\nNot every sexual moment between you and your partner (or even yourself) will be as magical as the novels claim. And dating sometimes sucks! Your perfect partner may not be a billionaire mafioso who kills any man who looks at you. It's very unlikely you'll randomly stumble upon the heir to a multi-million-dollar corporation and fake marry him to save your family from their rising debt.\n\nFrankly, you'll likely kiss lots of toads before you meet a prince. Because, unfortunately, that's the real world. And we live there, not in the sentences and fragments of an author.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\nIt's so easy to get swept into the romanticism of it all, but becoming disconnected from reality and lost in fantasy only leads to disappointment and maybe sadness, resentment, and despair. Dating is already hard and I don't need to make it any harder by being delusional. Finding a book boyfriend (does a thing even exist?) is not as easy as these female protagonists proclaim.\n\nAnd even if I find one, there's no certainty that we'll be compatible, have a happily ever after, or even have a good sex life. Hell, we may break up after two to three years. The story may be set in stone but reality isn't. Keep that in mind the next time you're scrolling on Hinge and believe you found the *one.* Chances are, they're nothing more than another number.

Here's how to deal.\n\nBy Noma Nazish, Published on July 29, 2024\nVerywell Mind\n\nGetty Images\n\n**Table of Contents**\n===============\n\n*   [Understanding the Situation](#understanding-the-situation)\n*   [Weighing Your Options](#weighing-your-options)\n*   [Communication Strategies](#communication-strategies)\n*   [Conflict Resolution](#conflict-resolution)\n*   [Seeking Mediation or External Help](#seeking-mediation-or-external-help)\n*   [Self-Care and Coping Strategies](#self-care-and-coping-strategies)\n*   [Knowing When to Seek Alternative Living Arrangements](#knowing-when-to-seek-alternative-living-arrangements)\n\n**Understanding the Situation**\n=============================\n\nDealing with a bad roommate can be stressful. But with the right communication and conflict resolution techniques, it's possible to work things out and establish a harmonious relationship.\n\n### Types of Bad Roommates\n\n*   The Noisemaker: Your roommate is always too loud or throws late-night parties without notice.\n*   The Slob: They never clean up after themselves and treat the whole place like their personal dumpster.\n*   The Borrower: They take your things without asking and don't return them.\n*   The Passive-Aggressive: They show bitterness and hostility when they feel hurt or offended but never tell you what's bothering them.\n*   The Drama King or Queen: They are constantly surrounded by drama, seeking validation or sympathy.\n\n**Weighing Your Options**\n=====================\n\nSo, how can you address the issues you're having with your roommate in a constructive way? It could include strategies like improving communication, practicing assertiveness, and setting boundaries.\n\n### Strategies to Deal With Dysregulation\n\n*   Improve Communication: Have open conversations and practice assertiveness instead of passive aggression.\n*   Set Boundaries: Create ground rules after mutual discussion.\n*   Self-Care: Prioritize self-care to manage stress and improve emotional regulation.\n\n**Communication Strategies**\n==========================\n\nCommunication is not the same as confrontation. Keep in mind that communication should be an attempt to share feelings openly without worrying about being attacked for what you are feeling or needing.\n\n### Six Key Communication Strategies\n\n*   Use I Statements: Frame your concerns using 'I' statements to avoid sounding accusatory.\n*   Practice Non-Violent Communication (NVC): Remove blame and use empathy and neutral language.\n*   Keep Your Body Language Non-Aggressive: Make sure your body language is open and non-threatening while maintaining eye contact.\n*   Explain Rather Than Complain: Clearly define what the problem is and how it affects you and the shared living space.\n*   Assume Positive Intent: Sometimes, when other people don't behave favorably, they might simply be unaware or doing their best but still making mistakes.\n\n**Conflict Resolution**\n=====================\n\nWhen you live with others, conflicts are bound to happen over one thing or another. However, with a well-defined approach to conflict resolution, you don't have to avoid or overreact to these situations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Strategy for Conflict Resolution\n\n1.  Evaluate the Problem: Identify the issue and consider how it impacts you so you can communicate it to your roommate.\n2.  See If It's Actually a Dispute: Determine if the issue is worth discussing.\n3.  Pick the Right Time: Set a time and place to discuss the issue when both of you are calm and better able to communicate.\n4.  Listen Actively: Give your roommate a chance to share their perspective and listen to them without interrupting.\n5.  Seek Common Ground: Identify common objectives and work towards a solution.\n\n**Seeking Mediation or External Help**\n=====================================\n\nInvolving a neutral third party, such as a counselor or a resident advisor, can help roommates resolve their differences by providing an unbiased perspective and a structured framework for facilitating a constructive dialogue.\n\n### Benefits of Seeking Mediation\n\n*   A third-party mediator would be able to ensure the conversation stays on track and doesn't spiral into personal attacks.\n*   They are less likely to have tunnel vision when trying to resolve the situation and can come up with out-of-the-box solutions.\n\n**Self-Care and Coping Strategies**\n====================================\n\nWhen there is conflict at home, you experience physiological and psychological symptoms of fight-or-flight and anticipatory anxiety. It's essential to prioritize self-care to manage stress and improve emotional regulation.\n\n### Five Expert-Backed Self-Care Strategies\n\n*   Practice Mindfulness: Practicing mindfulness and relaxation techniques like breathwork, yoga, or gratitude journaling can significantly reduce stress and anxiety.\n*   Create a Personal Retreat: Establish a personal space where you can retreat to break away from daily stressors and unwind.\n*   Get Moving: Regular physical activity helps lower cortisol levels and releases endorphins, which are natural stress relievers.\n*   Don't Take It Personally: Know that whatever is happening is not personal. You could have 10 roommates and say the same thing to each one of them, and they will all react differently.\n*   Put Your Creative Hat On: Engaging in creative hobbies like painting, writing, or knitting can help take your mind off roommate troubles.\n\n**Knowing When to Seek Alternative Living Arrangements**\n=====================================================\n\nSometimes our fundamental needs and values conflict with those of our roommates. In this case, there may be no way around it but to transition to a new living situation.\n\n### Signs It's Time to Move On\n\n*   You have more L's (leave) than S's (stay) in your notepad.\n*   Your roommate is consistently causing stress and anxiety.\n*   You've tried addressing the issues, but they persist.", "category": "general"},

It plays an important role in our identity and shapes our perspectives including how we think and feel about mental health.\n\nThere are many mental health considerations unique to certain racial and cultural groups. The stigmatization of bisexual men, the strong Black women stereotype, and the lack of mental health services for Indigenous communities. These are just a few examples of how race and culture align with mental health and wellness.\n\nLearn more about the relationship between your identity, your racial group, and your mental health here.\n\n### What's the Difference Between Race and Ethnicity?\nWhat Does It Mean To Be Anti-racist?

What Is Intersectionality?\n\nUnderstanding White Privilege\n\nThe Intersection of LGBTQIA+ and BIPOC Identities\n\nPlaying the Game of Respectability Politics, But At What Cost?\n\n### FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nWhat is the concept of race?\nThe dictionary by Merriam-Webster defines race as a category of humankind that shares certain distinctive physical traits.\n\n1. Race is usually associated with biology and linked with physical characteristics, such as hair texture or skin color, and covers a relatively narrow range of options.\nYet people of similar complexions hair textures can be defined as different races, and definitions in the United States have changed over time.\n\n### What are the six categories of race?\nWhen completing paperwork that asks for race, you may be asked to identify yourself as belonging to one or more of the following categories:\n\n*   White\n*   Black or African American\n*   Asian American\n*   American Indian or Alaska Native\n*   Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander\n*   Some other race\n\nWhile some may be considered to be of a certain race, Black people, for example, may identify more with their individual ethnicity, as opposed to race. This could apply to any member of any race.\n\n### Learn More:\nRace vs. Ethnicity\n\nWhy is it important to learn about race and ethnicity?\nConversations about race and ethnicity are key to building empathy, facilitating acceptance, understanding, and respect for those with people from other backgrounds.\n\nSuch histories of other cultures and races are often erased or minimized from mainstream narratives, so it is essential to learn about the struggles and experiences of marginalized groups.\n\n### Learn More:\nWhy It's Important to Learn About Indigenous Peoples\n\n### KEY TERMS\nBIPOC Inclusion Diversity Microaggressions Cultural Assimilation Intersectionality\n\n*   **BIPOC**: The acronym BIPOC stands for Black, Indigenous, and People Of Color and is pronounced buy-pock as opposed to saying each letter individually. The BIPOC acronym builds on the former acronym of POC (people of color), acknowledging that not all people of color have the same experiences or deal with the same types of injustice.\n*   **Inclusion**: Inclusion refers to the act or practice of including and accommodating people who have historically been excluded (because of their race, gender, sexuality, or ability).\n*   **Diversity**: Diversity refers to the quality of representing people from a range of different social and ethnic backgrounds and of different genders, sexual orientations, etc.\n*   **Microaggressions**: A microaggression is a subtle verbal or nonverbal behavior, committed consciously or not, that is directed at a member of a marginalized group, and has a harmful, derogatory effect.\n*   **Cultural Assimilation**: Cultural assimilation refers to the act of sacrificing one's own culture to adopt the lifestyle, behaviors, and beliefs of the dominant culture group.\n*   **Intersectionality**: The term intersectionality was first coined by civil rights scholar Kimberl√© Crenshaw in the late '80s. It refers to an individual's multiple identities and how they're subject to various forms of intersecting oppression.\n\n### EXPLORE RACE AND SOCIAL JUSTICE\n\nYes, Even Social Activists Need Rest Too\nWhy Identity Matters and How It Shapes Us\n10 Types of Discrimination to Be Aware Of\nCultural Awareness-How to Be More Culturally Aware & Improve Your Relationships\nHow Embracing Your Cultural Identity Can Help Your Mental Health\nThe Impact of Racial Trauma and How to Cope\nThe Mental Effects of Racism on the Latinx Community\nWhat Is Racial Ambiguity?\n6 Harmful Stereotypes About Latin Americans\nWhy Black Mental Wealth Is the Bigger Picture of Black Mental Health\nAs a Therapist, Here Are 4 Ways to Cope in Times of Civil Unrest\nUnderstanding and Addressing Stereotype Threat\nThe Differences Between Appreciating and Appropriating Culture\nHealth Literacy: The Overlooked Treatment Gap & Its Impact on BIPOC Mental Health\nBroken Windows Theory\n\n'Marianismo' Culture in the Latino Community and How It Impacts Mental Health\nMachismo: The Traits and Impact of Traditional Masculinity\nHow Do Microaggressions Affect the AAPI Community?\n10 Mental Health Strategies That Have Asian Origins\nCode Switching: How and Why It Happens\nCultural Assimilation-How It Affects Mental Health\n\nWhat to Do When a Loved One Is Being Racist\nWhat Is Emotional Labor?\n\nHow to Cope With Black Racial Injustice\nMental Health Resources for the Black Community\n17 Mental Health Resources For Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders\n8 Mental Health Resources for the Latino Community\n\nDoes Living With Racism Cause Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder?\nWhat Does the Term 'LatinX' Mean?\nMental Health Effects of Racism on Indigenous Communities\nHow Othering Contributes to Discrimination and Prejudice\nExploring the Mental Health Stigma in Black Communities\nUnderstanding What Police Brutality Is and Why It Occurs\nColorism and the Impact of Skin Tone Discrimination\n\nSystemic Racism Takes a Toll on BIPOC Mental Health\nWhat Is Inclusion?\nThe Importance of Representation in Books\nHow to Navigate Your Own Privilege\nThings to Consider Before You Call the Police on Someone\nHow to Find a Culturally Sensitive Therapist\nWhat Is White Guilt?\n\n10 Organizations That Support Racial Equality\nThe Psychology of Racism\nHarmful Psychological Effects of Racial Stereotyping\n\n7 Strategies to Help You on Your Anti-Racism Journey\nWhat Is White Fragility?\nWhat Are Microaggressions?\nWhat Is the Model Minority Myth?\nUnderstanding Environmental Racism\nThe Role of Silence in Asian American Families\nLet's End the 'Undesirable Asian Male' Stereotype\nIf My Parents Stayed in Hong Kong, I May Not Be Alive Today\nWhy Fetishizing AAPI Women Is an Act of Violence\n\nMental Illness Doesn't Discriminate, and Neither Should We\nHave You Eaten Yet? : Food Is the Ultimate Asian Love Language\nMental Health Impact of Straddling a Dual Identity as an Asian American\nSouth Asians Are Asians, Too\nIntergenerational Trauma in AAPI Communities\nYes, Positive Stereotypes Are Still Harmful\n\nHow a Temazcal Works\nWhat Is the Difference Between Hispanic and Latino?\nYolo Akili Robinson Is Building Up Black Communities\nVincent Flores-Maldonado Keeps Culture at the Core of Communal Healing\nMore In", "category": "general"},

{"title": "Is Depression Hereditary?", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/is-depression-genetic-1067317", "content": "Last Updated: August 24, 2023 Aron Janssen, MD Dr. Aron Janssen is a board-certified psychiatrist and Assistant Professor in the Departments of Psychiatry and Family Medicine at the University of Central Florida College of Medicine. He has published articles on various topics including mental health stigma, sleep disorders, addiction, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Last Updated: August 24, 2023\n\n**Is Depression Hereditary?**\n\nDepression is a complex condition that can be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. While there may be a heritable component to depression, genetics is not the only determinant. Other factors contribute to risk, while some can be protective.\n\n*   A child who has a parent with depression may have a genetic predisposition but will not necessarily become depressed.\n*   On the other hand, a child who does not have a family member with depression and is not genetically predisposed to the condition may become depressed if they are exposed to a triggering event such as experiencing a trauma.\n\n**The Role of Genetics in Depression**\n\nResearch has demonstrated that genes play a role in the potential risk for many health conditions, including depression. Studies have suggested there is a heritable component to depression. Some research has also indicated that women may be more susceptible to the genetic influences associated with depression than men.\n\n*   When studying depression or other health conditions, researchers often look for changes in genes called variants.\n*   These changes are classified according to the effect (if any) they have on the gene.\n*   Families can often predict what color a child's eyes will be by looking to parents and other close relatives, but variants can behave unexpectedly.\n\n**Understanding Genetic Variations**\n\nHeredity is a complex interplay of many factors, not just individual genes. When studying depression or other health conditions, researchers often look for changes in genes called variants. These changes are classified according to the effect (if any) they have on the gene.\n\n*   Having a genetic variant can make it more likely-but not definitive-that you will develop a condition associated with that variant.\n*   If a gene associated with a specific condition is altered, it may be more (or less) likely to contribute to the development of that condition.\n\n**Can Genetics Affect Mental Health Treatment?**\n\nDepression can be treated with medication, psychotherapy, and other interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Some people may be prescribed a combination of treatments. Your genes may influence how well a specific treatment works for you.\n\n*   Research has indicated that certain genes might affect how well your body absorbs, uses, and excretes alcohol and drugs, including antidepressant medications.\n*   Several genes are known to influence drug metabolism, but the results from these studies are primarily of interest to doctors and researchers.\n\n**Does Heritability of Depression Affect Children?**\n\nPeople with depression might be concerned they will pass on the condition to their children. While there could be a heritable component to depression, genetics is not the only determinant. Other factors contribute to risk, while some can be protective. A child who has a parent with depression may have a genetic predisposition but will not necessarily become depressed.\n\n*   On the other hand, a child who does not have a family member with depression and is not genetically predisposed to the condition may become depressed if they are exposed to a triggering event such as experiencing a trauma. Other known factors that contribute to all forms of depression and other mental health conditions include: brain chemistry changes in brain structure hormone imbalances extreme stress\n\n**Summary**\n\nHaving a genetic predisposition to depression can exacerbate these factors and may influence when someone becomes depressed as well as how long symptoms may last. However, it's essential to remember that depression can develop in anyone-even someone who isn't genetically predisposed and isn't susceptible to known risk factors.\n\n*   Identifying the signs of depression and being able to recognize them in yourself and others is crucial to ensuring the condition doesn't go untreated.\n*   If you or a loved one are struggling with depression, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database.\n\n**Sources**\n\n¬π \"Is Depression Hereditary?\" by Nancy Schimelpfening\n\n¬≤ Research studies have suggested that someone with a first-degree relative diagnosed with depression (a parent, sibling, or child) could be three times more likely to be diagnosed with depression in their lifetime compared to the general population. 3 \"Depression and Genetics\" by the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\n¬≥ Some research has also indicated that women may be more susceptible to the genetic influences associated with depression than men. 5 Why Some People Are More Prone to Depression\n\n4 Understanding Genetic Variations \n\n5 Heredity is a complex interplay of many factors, not just individual genes. When studying depression or other health conditions, researchers often look for changes in genes called variants.\n\n6 These changes are classified according to the effect (if any) they have on the gene.\n\n7 Research has identified several genetic variants associated with depression, but no single gene has been definitively linked to the condition.\n\n8 Can Genetics Affect Mental Health Treatment?\n\n9 While some consumer genomic test kits provide information about topics like drug metabolism, genomic testing is not the same as genetic testing. \n\n10 Additional research is needed to understand what findings from genetic studies could mean for antidepressants as well as other medications used to treat depression.\n\n11  Talk to your doctor before using your genomic health information to make decisions about your healthcare, including your depression treatment.\n\n12 Does Heritability of Depression Affect Children? People with depression might be concerned they will pass on the condition to their children. While there could be a heritable component to depression, genetics is not the only determinant. Other factors contribute to risk, while some can be protective.\n\n13 Non-Genetic Causes of Depression Genetics is one of several potential causes of depression. Knowing the possible causes can help you better understand depression, but remember that depression can also develop in the absence of a clear cause and be difficult to pinpoint.\n\n14 Other known factors that contribute to all forms of depression and other mental health conditions include: brain chemistry changes in brain structure hormone imbalances extreme stress\n\n15 Summary Having a genetic predisposition to depression can exacerbate these factors and may influence when someone becomes depressed as well as how long symptoms may last.

According to experts, using meditation as a form of treatment should be in collaboration with your care team and should not be considered a one-stop-shop solution to mental health conditions.\n\nI don't know about you but I initially found meditation incredibly difficult to understand. I have a physical disability and multiple mental health conditions, including depression and an anxiety disorder. Even my physical disability, cerebral palsy, is inherently tied to my brain. Some days, to call me a mess is an understatement, but at least my brain damage is visible on a scan.\n\nIn my mid-20s through five-ish years ago-meditation as a treatment option seemed not just sensible, but inevitable. If everyone else was doing it-even on the Canadian prairies where I live-why wasn't I? However, when I was first asked to try mindfulness meditation, I was at a loss.\n\nWhat do you mean you want me to sit here, and imagine the traffic floating by, and contemplate my thoughts without getting into those imaginary cars? What if I wanted to get into one of those cars? What if they were going somewhere cool? What if the vehicle was self-driving? What if they were going to San Francisco? I'd love to go to San Francisco.\n\nSometimes, my mind would float away to my to-do list, or my day job at the time working at an arts non-profit, or the weather, or anything but the calmness I was supposed to focus on. I eventually did find a mindfulness practice that worked for me, yoga nidra, but that was after many months of trial and error.\n\nHere's hoping this article can help you find a meditation practice for your mental health a little smoother and easier.\n\n**How Meditation Can Help With Depression**\n\nThe causes of depression are complicated and not fully understood, Some point to genetics, others to physiology, and factors such as stress and anxiety. Brent Nelson, MD, adult interventional psychiatrist and chief medical information officer at PrairieCare, says that for him, the focus on the brain is a helpful framework to understand how meditation can help with depression.\n\nThe brain has 100 billion neurons with 100 trillion connections, so it's very complicated, Nelson says. And the cause of depression is still yet to be fully understood, but we know it's a complex process. It's often interleaved with other things such as anxiety or trauma, and really, for a lot of people, is a function of stress meeting, maybe, an underlying genetic predisposition.\n\nMeditation, when used to treat depression, is not isolated on an island. When suggested by a psychologist, a psychiatrist, or a therapist, meditation is often used alongside medications, methodologies like cognitive-behavioral therapy, and treatments like transcranial magnetic stimulation.\n\nNelson tells Verywell Mind that he often starts patients with mindfulness meditations. A lot of times we will start with mindfulness meditation because what it really can let people do is get their brain to be more connected, kind of in the moment, in the here and now, and less so in the distant past or anxiety over the future, which often can be a challenge in depression, he adds.\n\n**What [mindfulness meditation] really can let people do is get their brain to be more connected, kind of in the moment, in the here and now, and less so in the distant past or anxiety over the future, which often can be a challenge in depression.**\n\n- BRENT NELSON, MD\n\nJulie Potiker, a certified mindful self-compassion teacher of the UCSD's Center for Mindfulness believes that meditation is a key reason why she was able to recover from her bouts with depression.\n\nIt's not at all like loosey-goosey or woo woo, or anything like that... I used to be a clinically depressed person, and I used to take antidepressants, and I had postpartum depression, so I'm really a poster child for this...Mindful self-compassion, that's what I leaned into, and that's why I became a teacher of it, and then that's why I became certified in it, she says.\n\n**How to Fight Depression Without Medication**\n\n**How to Get Started**\n\nPotiker, who tends to focus initially on a loving-kindness meditation, says that zeroing in on self-compassion and gratitude can be especially valuable for those facing depression, in her experience. In terms of getting started, her recent advice to someone she supports-rather than building up meditation to be a big burdensome practice-was to start small.\n\nI talked to her about little micro-moments, trying to do it once an hour, Potiker explains. Where you either look out the window or you take a walk, or you play one of your favorite songs, or something that makes your body feel good, and you enrich it and absorb it for moments, I don't mean minutes, and you just really feel because it just folds right into gratitude.\n\n**8-Minute Video Meditation to Becoming More Mindful**\n\n**What Types of Meditation Work Best**\n\nA 2015 analysis looked at seven different meditation techniques and their effectiveness. Those included:\n\n1.  Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy\n2.  Pata√±jali Yoga\n3.  Qigong\n4.  Sahaj Yoga\n5.  Inner Resources Meditation\n6.  Sudarshan Kriya Yoga\n7.  Tai Chi\n\nNelson says that, when in doubt, patients should refer back to the medical professionals supporting them. He says this can include asking your care team about local resources, including regional centers tied to local universities that are studying and implementing meditation strategies for those with mental health disorders.\n\nIt's always going back to your treatment team, and having a multi-specialty treatment team that can really look at this particular unique individual from a few different perspectives and help give good, reliable guidance, Nelson adds.\n\n**How You Should Meditate, According to Your Personality**\n\n**Tips for Meditation Success**\n\nMeditation can help mitigate depression symptoms when used in conjunction with a professional treatment plan. Here are some tips to get the most out of your practice:\n\n*   Speak to a professional: Meditation is only a smaller part of a broader care plan including medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes.\n*   Make sure you are working with an accredited and recommended practitioner.\n*   Focus on something you can sustain: You don't need to have a perfect meditation practice and it may take time to find the right type of meditation that works for you.\n*   Make sure you're in a safe space: If you're triggered by the type of meditation you are doing, and if you feel unsafe, find a way to self-regulate. This might look like leaving the session, getting a drink of water, or trying an entirely different type of meditation.\n\n**", "category": "general"},

Interviewed by Adam England on September 28, 2024.\n\n**Coping When You Have Both**\n\nIt's common for depression and anxiety to co-exist, and having both can be more difficult for us to cope with than having just one or the other-though it's different for everyone.\n\nMedication, therapy, and lifestyle changes can all help us cope.\n\n### Medication\n\n*   Medication can be useful, but it can differ from person to person.\n*   I never got on with medication really-Zoloft (sertraline) made my depression ten times worse, it felt like, Elisha explains.\n*   Lee, 25, meanwhile, has tried various medications, and has been on Effexor (venlafaxine) for just over a year.\n*   They've upped the dosage a few times now and I now take it three times a day, she says.\n*   They haven't managed to find something that works for my anxiety yet, but I've found if I can manage the depression then that has a knock-on effect and I don't struggle so much with the anxiety.\n\n### Therapy\n\n*   Dr Touroni advises seeking professional support to address both depression and anxiety holistically.\n*   She advises developing your own 'toolkit' of coping mechanisms, which might comprise a mix of therapy, lifestyle changes, and perhaps medication.\n*   Many of her clients have found cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) useful because:\n    *   It addresses both anxiety and depression by helping to challenge negative thought patterns and manage overwhelming emotions.\n*   Sham Singh, MD, a psychiatrist at WINIT Clinic, says, In dealing with anxiety and depression, I look at their underlying causes, which might be emotional or environmental, but at times even biological.\n*   This comprehensive approach will help not only in relieving symptoms but also in preventing their recurrence.\n\n### Lifestyle Changes\n\n*   Making lifestyle changes can also help-for Lee, keeping routines is helpful for anxiety.\n*   There's less chance of getting anxious if I know what's going to happen; but on the flip side, it makes it worse if something unexpected happens, she explains.\n*   You may decide to try mindfulness and grounding techniques yourself, too, whether they're things you've explored in therapy or not.\n*   Dr. Touroni describes them as being incredibly helpful in managing anxiety, letting us focus on the present rather than spiraling into worrying about the future.\n*   She also recommends setting small, achievable goals for depression-take one step at a time, celebrate any wins no matter how small, and recognize the progress you're making.\n\n### Physical Activity\n\n*   Physical activity can help reduce anxiety and boost your mood, so even going for a short walk, if you feel up to it, can help.\n*   While Morgan is on medication for her anxiety and depression, she does this too.\n*   I thrive on keeping routines, making set times to do things I love, and giving myself plenty of grace.\n*   I tackle one thing my depression wants me to avoid every day, like cleaning my room, to stop myself from getting too anxious.\n\n### Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Depression and Anxiety\n\n1.  Address both anxiety and depression by helping to challenge negative thought patterns and manage overwhelming emotions.\n2.  Focus on the present rather than spiraling into worrying about the future.\n3.  Set small, achievable goals for depression-take one step at a time, celebrate any wins no matter how small, and recognize the progress you're making.\n\n### How To Talk To People About It (If You Want To)\n\nTalking to people about our depression and anxiety isn't always easy-often, people might just not be able to relate, even if they mean well.\n\n*   If you do decide to talk to people in your life, like friends, about depression and anxiety, it's fine to bring it up in conversation, or ask them if you'd be able to have a conversation with them.\n*   Of course, it's easier said than done, and I've often struggled to reach out-particularly because I internalized ideas that men are meant to be 'strong' and not discuss their feelings\n*   Reaching out and talking to people is often the first step.\n*   We can often be pleasantly surprised with how our loved ones react.\n*   And if you don't feel able to talk to people in your life, you may find support online from people going through the same thing as us.\n\n### What to Do When You Need Someone to Talk To\n\nMost importantly, seeking support-whether through therapy, support groups, or talking to loved ones-is key to not feeling isolated in this struggle, says Dr. Touroni.\n\n*   Dr Singh says that he encourages his clients to be patient with themselves - and again, that any progress is great.\n*   That, combined with therapy and proper self-care routines such as regular exercise and sleep, can go a long way toward recovery, he says.\n\nWhile living with depression and anxiety concurrently can be a real struggle, there are ways to cope, whether that's opening up to loved ones, making lifestyle changes if we're able to, or trying therapy or medication. It's different for everybody, so it's a good idea for us to try out different coping mechanisms and strategies to find something that works.\n\nAnxiety vs. Depression Symptoms and Treatment Read More: CONDITIONS A-Z DEPRESSION LIVING WITH 3 Sources See Our Editorial Process Meet Our Review Board Share Feedback on This Article 1.

By understanding the relationship between these two conditions, seeking support, and trying different coping mechanisms, individuals can find ways to manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.\n\nIt's essential to remember that everyone's journey is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. Be patient with yourself, and don't be afraid to seek help when you need it. With the right support and strategies, you can learn to live with depression and anxiety and find a sense of hope and healing.\n\n**References**\n\n1.  Elena Touroni PhD.

People who struggle with eating disorders often become preoccupied with food and their body weight.\n\nThese conditions can be life-threatening if left untreated. Additionally, eating disorders often occur together with other mental health issues like depression, anxiety, panic disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorders.\n\nWithout treatment, eating disorders can cause a number of health-related problems including cardiovascular issues, gastrointestinal issues, and malnutrition. However, with proper treatment, people affected by eating disorders can resume healthy eating habits and can improve their mental health.\n\n**IMPACT OF EATING DISORDERS**\n\n*   What to Do If Your Teen Shows Signs of Bulimia\n*   Why Do Some People Get Eating Disorders?\n*   How Is Anorexia Nervosa Diagnosed?\n*   What to Know About Anorexia in Men\n\n**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**\n\nCould you have an eating disorder? Determining if you have an eating disorder begins with examining your thoughts and behaviors surrounding food, body image, and body weight.\n\nAlthough there is an extensive list of warning signs, not everyone will display every symptom. If you suspect you have an eating disorder, it's essential to talk to your doctor or a mental health professional.\n\nThe chance for recovery increases the sooner an eating disorder is addressed. Learn More: Symptoms of Eating Disorders\n\nWhat causes eating disorders? Eating disorders are complex disorders that stem from a variety of factors including genetics, cultural ideals, environmental, psychological, and biological influences.\n\nThese risk factors may also include mental health conditions like anxiety and depression along with body image issues. Learn More: Causes of Eating Disorders\n\nHow can you help someone with an eating disorder? To help a loved one with an eating disorder, be supportive of their recovery efforts without trying to fix, control, or counsel them.\n\nInstead, be patient and encouraging. Empower them to tackle their disordered eating and talk to a counselor or therapist. Are eating disorders genetic? There is some evidence that eating disorders are heritable.\n\nIn fact, in one study of twins, researchers discovered that 40% to 60% of the risk for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder arises from genetic influences. However, the development of an eating disorder is a complex process impacted by various factors and not just about genetic influences.\n\nLearn More: What Causes an Eating Disorder?\n\n**KEY TERMS**\n\n*   Anorexia Nervosa\n*   Bulimia Nervosa\n*   Binge-Eating Disorder\n*   Rumination Disorder\n*   Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder\n*   Psychological Evaluation\n*   Family-Based Therapy\n*   Cognitive Behavioral Therapy\n\n**ANOREXIA NERVOSA**\n\nAnorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by not eating enough and impacts all areas of a person's life. A person affected by anorexia nervosa may have a low body weight and a distorted body image.\n\nThey also may have an intense fear of gaining weight and often use extreme measures to control their weight and shape. Warning Signs of Anorexia Nervosa\n\n**BULIMIA NERVOSA**\n\nBulimia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating followed by purging or another method designed to prevent weight gain such as the use of laxatives, excessive exercises, and fasting.\n\nDue to guilt and shame associated with bulimia nervosa, people affected by this disorder will go to great lengths to hide their behaviors. Signs and Symptoms of Bulimia Nervosa\n\n**BINGE-EATING DISORDER**\n\nBinge eating is an eating disorder characterized by consuming large amounts of food even when the person isn't hungry.\n\nTypically, the person feels out of control as well as a sense of shame and guilt over their binge eating. Unlike people with bulimia nervosa, they do not try to purge the food after it is consumed. What Is Binge Eating?\n\n**RUMINATION DISORDER**\n\nRumination disorder is an eating disorder that involves bringing previously chewed or previously swallowed food back up in order to spit it out or re-swallow it.\n\nThese behaviors are often done in secret because of a fear of what people will think. What Is Rumination Disorder?\n\n**AVOIDANT RESTRICTIVE FOOD INTAKE DISORDER**\n\nARFID is an eating disorder in which the person affected has a strong preference for a narrow range of foods and may refuse to eat any food that is outside of these parameters.\n\nUnlike other eating disorders, people with ARFID do not worry about weight gain or body composition. Understanding Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder\n\n**PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION**\n\nDuring a psychological evaluation, a psychologist or therapist will use a variety of tests and assessments to measure and observe a person's thoughts and behaviors.\n\nAt the completion of a psychological evaluation, the psychologist will make a diagnosis and recommend treatment options. How Eating Disorders Are Diagnosed\n\n**FAMILY-BASED THERAPY**\n\nSometimes referred to as the Maudsley Method, family-based therapy (FBT) is the leading treatment option for treating adolescents with eating disorders.\n\nFBT involves the whole family and primarily takes place in outpatient settings. It is the fastest and most effective treatment for children, adolescents, and young adults.\n\nFamily-Based Therapy for Eating Disorders\n\n**COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY**\n\nCBT is a type of treatment that focuses on helping a person learn how to identify destructive behaviors and thought processes.\n\nThrough CBT, a person's thoughts and behaviors are challenged and replaced with more realistic thoughts and behaviors.

{"title": "An Overview of Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-dysthymia-dysthymic-disorder-1066954", "content": "About This Article\n\n**Title**\nAn Overview of Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)\n\n**Overview**\nPersistent depressive disorder (PDD), formerly known as dysthymia, is a mood disorder characterized by a milder but more chronic form of depression. It reflects a spectrum of severity that can range from mild to severe.\n\n*   This diagnosis represents a prolonged state of depression with fewer symptoms than major depressive disorder (MDD).\n*   The symptoms are long-lasting and may be attributed to being stuck in a rut rather than as symptoms of a treatable condition.\n\n**Symptoms of Persistent Depressive Disorder**\nThe symptoms of PDD are very similar to MDD, but there is a wider range of symptoms available on the criteria list for MDD. To receive a diagnosis of PDD, you must have at least three of the following seven symptoms:\n*   A sad or depressed mood nearly every day.\n*   Changes in appetite (poor appetite or overeating).\n*   Sleep difficulties (too little or too much sleep).\n*   Lack of energy or fatigue.\n*   Poor self-esteem.\n*   Hopelessness or feeling stuck in a rut.\n*   Trouble concentrating or difficulty making decisions.\n\n**Timeframe of Persistent Depressive Disorder**\nThe symptoms of PDD are chronic, meaning that people experience a depressed mood for most days for a period of at least two years. The timeframe has been reduced to one year for children and teens.\n\n**Age of Onset**\nPDD may have an earlier onset than MDD, with symptoms first appearing during the childhood, teen, or young adult years.\n\n**Causes of Persistent Depressive Disorder**\nLike other forms of depression, the exact cause of PDD is not known. However, a number of factors are believed to play a role, including:\n\n*   Temperament\n*   Environmental factors (e.g., parental loss or separation, childhood adversity, prolonged stress, grief, major life changes, and trauma)\n*   Genetics\n*   Brain chemistry\n\n**Confirming a Diagnosis of PDD**\nThere is no laboratory test for diagnosing dysthymia or any other form of depression. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, your doctor will evaluate your symptoms and medical history.\n\n**Treatment for Persistent Depressive Disorder**\nThe treatments for PDD are similar to those for other forms of depression. Generally, a combination of psychotherapy and medications is the most effective.\n\n*   Talk therapy: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT)\n*   Medications: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)\n\n**Coping With Persistent Depressive Disorder**\nThere are a number of different things that people can do to help cope with persistent depression. Some things that you can do include:\n\n*   Avoiding alcohol and other substances\n*   Creating daily routines that help structure and balance your day\n*   Eating a healthy diet\n*   Establishing a consistent sleep schedule\n*   Getting regular exercise several times each week\n*   Leaving the house and making plans with friends\n*   Practicing stress management techniques such as journaling, taking a walk, and deep breathing\n\n**Conclusion**\nEven very mild symptoms of depression can disrupt your ability to function and enjoy life, particularly when these symptoms are long-lasting. Fortunately, there are effective treatments available for persistent depressive disorder that can make a major difference in your health and well-being. Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling to explore the treatment options that are right for you. 7 Sources 7. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-about-ptsd/201808/the-long-term-effects-depression-is-this-you-in-10-years, The Long-Term Effects of Depression: Is This You in 10 Years?

Bipolar I disorder involves episodes of severe mania and often depression. Bipolar II disorder involves a less severe form of mania called hypomania.1 There is also a third type known as cyclothymic disorder. Research suggests that around 4.4% of U.S. adults will have bipolar disorder at some point in their lives.2 Genetics are thought to play a significant role, although brain abnormalities and environmental factors also contribute as causes of bipolar disorder.\n\nMood stabilizers are usually the first-line treatment, but electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be used to address severe symptoms.\n\n**LIVING WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER**\n\n5 Movies That Portray What It's Like to Have Bipolar Disorder\nSpeaking to a Loved One With Bipolar Disorder\nWhat It Really Feels Like to Live With Bipolar Disorder\nCould Your Child Have Bipolar Disorder?\n\n**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**\n\n*   What causes bipolar disorder?

Understanding emotions can help us navigate life's complexities, develop emotional intelligence, and cultivate healthy coping skills.\n\n**The Importance of Emotions**\n\nEmotions play a significant role in shaping who we are and how we interact with the world around us. They allow us to form connections, make decisions, and respond to situations in meaningful ways.\n\n*   Emotions can be both positive and negative, influencing our mood, behavior, and relationships.\n*   Understanding emotions can help us develop emotional intelligence, which is essential for effective communication, conflict resolution, and personal growth.\n\n**The 6 Types of Basic Emotions**\n\nResearch has identified six basic emotions that are universally experienced across cultures:\n\n1.  Happiness\n2.  Sadness\n3.  Fear\n4.  Disgust\n5.  Anger\n6.  Surprise\n\nThese emotions serve as the foundation for more complex emotional experiences and play a crucial role in shaping our thoughts, behaviors, and relationships.\n\n**Emotional Intelligence**\n\nEmotional intelligence (EI) refers to the ability to perceive, control, and evaluate emotions. It involves understanding oneself and others, recognizing emotional cues, and developing effective strategies for managing emotions.\n\n*   Emotional intelligence can be developed through practice, self-awareness, and mindfulness.\n*   Developing emotional intelligence can improve relationships, communication, and overall well-being.\n\n**The Emotion Wheel**\n\nThe emotion wheel is a classification system introduced by psychologist Robert Plutchik. It helps individuals understand and label their emotions, promoting emotional literacy and awareness.\n\n*   The emotion wheel consists of eight primary colors, each representing a different emotion.\n*   Understanding the emotion wheel can help individuals develop self-awareness, recognize emotional cues, and improve relationships.\n\n**Healthy Coping Skills**\n\nDeveloping healthy coping skills is essential for managing uncomfortable emotions. This includes:\n\n1.  Mindfulness practices\n2.  Exercise and physical activity\n3.  Creative expression (art, music, writing)\n4.  Social support networks\n5.  Emotional regulation techniques (deep breathing, meditation)\n\nBy cultivating these skills, individuals can develop resilience, improve emotional well-being, and navigate life's challenges with greater ease.\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n*   How many emotions are there?\n    While researchers have identified six basic emotions, there are over 27 different categories of emotions.\n*   What causes emotions?\n    Emotions are influenced by a network of interconnected structures in the brain that make up the limbic system.\n*   Can we control our emotions?\n    Yes, individuals can develop self-regulation skills through mindfulness and emotional intelligence.\n\nEmotions play a vital role in shaping who we are and how we interact with the world around us.

Accessed August 2023.\n\n**What is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder?**\n\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition characterized by recurring thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions). An estimated 2.3% of U.S. adults experience OCD at some point in their lives, with the condition being more common in women than men.\n\n**Causes of OCD**\n\nThe exact causes of OCD are not completely understood, but a combination of factors likely play a role. Research suggests that increased activity in certain areas of the brain is linked to a higher risk for OCD. Environmental factors such as sudden life changes, relationship troubles, abuse, illness, and stress may also contribute to the onset of the condition.\n\n**Symptoms of OCD**\n\nCommon symptoms of OCD include:\n\n*   Recurring thoughts (obsessions) that create distress\n*   Repetitive behaviors (compulsions) aimed at reducing anxiety caused by obsessions\n*   Significant interference with daily life\n\n**Types of OCD**\n\nWhile the DSM-5 does not list specific subtypes, research suggests that OCD can present in a few different forms, including:\n\n*   Hoarding disorder\n*   Ordering and symmetry\n*   Contamination and cleaning\n*   Checking\n*   Obsessive thoughts without compulsions\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nOCD is typically treated with medication and psychotherapy.

In the earlier version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), OCD was classed with anxiety disorders. In the 2013 publication of the DSM-5, OCD was separated into its own unique category called Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders.\n\n**What are some common co-occurring conditions with OCD?**\n\nResearch suggests that individuals with OCD often experience other mental health conditions, including:\n\n*   Anxiety disorders\n*   Depression\n*   Eating disorders\n*   Personality disorders\n\n**How can I help someone with OCD?**\n\nIf you know someone who is struggling with OCD, it's essential to be supportive and understanding.

Types Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatments Coping What Is Psychosis? Psychosis is a loss of contact with reality, typically including delusions (false ideas about what is taking place or who you are) and hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there). It impacts the way that the brain processes information. When experiencing psychosis, people may hear, see, feel, or believe things that are not real.1 Psychosis is a symptom associated with a number of health conditions including the manic phase of bipolar I disorder, as well as schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and schizoaffective disorder. Other conditions where psychosis may be present include postpartum psychosis and depressive episodes. About 7 in every 1000 people experience psychosis at some time in their lives.2 Postpartum Psychosis Can Be Fatal If Left Untreated-Here's What to Know \n\n**What Is Psychosis?**\n\nPsychosis is a loss of contact with reality, typically including delusions (false ideas about what is taking place or who you are) and hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there). It impacts the way that the brain processes information. When experiencing psychosis, people may hear, see, feel, or believe things that are not real.\n\n1.  Psychosis is a symptom associated with a number of health conditions including the manic phase of bipolar I disorder, as well as schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and schizoaffective disorder.\n2.  Other conditions where psychosis may be present include postpartum psychosis and depressive episodes.\n3.  About 7 in every 1000 people experience psychosis at some time in their lives.\n\n**Types**\n\nSome forms of psychosis are brought on by a specific condition, such as:\n\n1.  Bipolar disorder, which may involve manic episodes that can lead to psychosis\n2.  Brief psychotic disorder, which is a short and sudden onset of psychosis, often in response to a stressful situation, that usually lasts less than a month\n3.  Delusional disorder, which is marked by an inability to distinguish between what is real and imagined\n4.  Drug-induced psychosis, which may occur when a person is withdrawing from a drug such as alcohol or methamphetamine\n5.  Postpartum psychosis, a severe form of postpartum depression that, while relatively rare, requires emergency medical intervention\n6.  Schizoaffective disorder, which involves symptoms of a mood disorder and schizophrenia\n7.  Schizophrenia, which is characterized by a range of psychotic symptoms\n8.  Schizophreniform disorder, a short-term type of schizophrenia\n9.  Severe depression can also cause people to experience symptoms of psychosis\n\nPsychosis can also be induced by illness or medication or caused by a medical condition, such as a brain tumor, brain disease, or brain infection.\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nPsychosis in itself is a symptom of another problem, not its own illness. Symptoms of psychosis include:\n\n1.  Delusions\n2.  Disorganized, scattered thinking and speech\n3.  Hallucinations\n4.  Thoughts that jump around from subject to subject\n\nIf you think you or someone you love is experiencing psychosis, it's essential to seek medical treatment immediately.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact causes of psychosis are not entirely clear and each person's experience may be different.\n\n1.  Physical problems that can cause psychosis include:\n    *   Alcohol and certain illicit drugs, including methamphetamine\n    *   Brain cysts or tumors\n    *   Certain prescription drugs, particularly steroids and stimulants\n    *   Certain types of epilepsy\n    *   Dementia\n    *   HIV\n    *   Parkinson's disease\n    *   Stroke\n2.  Psychosis can also be caused by a mental health condition such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, or depression.\n3.  People are more likely to develop psychosis if they also have a close family member who has a psychotic disorder.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nPsychosis is a symptom of another health condition, not a diagnosis in and of itself. In order to determine what might be causing psychosis, a doctor will perform a physical and collect a medical history. They will also ask questions about the symptoms including its severity and duration. They will also want to know about any other symptoms that you might be experiencing.\n\nIn some cases, your doctor may perform special tests in order to rule out medical conditions that may be causing your psychosis. Once your doctor has diagnosed what is causing your symptoms, they can recommend treatments that are best suited to your particular situation.\n\n**Treatments**\n\nTreating psychosis depends on the cause.\n\n1.  Hospitalization may be necessary.\n2.  If you have a disorder that involves psychosis, starting or changing antipsychotics may also be helpful in keeping psychotic symptoms and episodes at bay.\n3.  Typical Antipsychotics:\n    *   Haldol (haloperidol)\n    *   Loxitane (loxapine)\n    *   Navane (thiothixene)\n    *   Prolixin (fluphenazine)\n    *   Stelazine (trifluoperazine)\n    *   Thorazine (chlorpromazine)\n    *   Trilafon (perphenazine)\n4.  Atypical Antipsychotics:\n    *   Abilify (aripiprazole)\n    *   Clozaril (clozapine)\n    *   Fanapt (iloperidone)\n    *   Geodon (ziprasidone)\n    *   Invega (paliperidone)\n    *   Latuda (lurasidone)\n    *   Rexulti (brexipiprazole)\n    *   Risperdal (risperidone)\n    *   Saphris (asenapine maleate)\n    *   Seroquel (quetiapine)\n    *   Vraylar (cariprazine)\n    *   Zyprexa (olanzapine)\n\n**Coping**\n\nIf you are experiencing symptoms of psychosis, it is essential to seek help immediately. There are also things that you can do along with treatment that may help you better cope:\n\n1.  Find social support.\n2.  Try looking for local support groups in your area or find an online group.\n3.  Understand your triggers.\n4.  Have a plan.\n\nIf you or a loved one are struggling with psychosis, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area.

{"title": "What Are the ICD-10 Criteria for Depression?", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/icd-10-criteria-for-depression-5308497", "content": "on This Page\n\n**What Are the ICD-10 Criteria for Depression?**\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) developed the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition (ICD-10) in 1990 to help diagnose patients with mental health disorders.1 The ICD-10 criteria for depression are a set of symptoms and signs that indicate the presence of the disorder.\n\n**History of the ICD-10 Criteria for Depression**\n\nThe ICD-10 criteria for depression were developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1990.2 They are similar to those of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which is used to diagnose mental disorders in the United States.\n\n*   The ICD-10 does not recognize premenstrual dysphoric disorder as a separate depression diagnosis, whereas the DSM does.\n*   The ICD-10 criteria for depression are also used in many other countries besides the United States. In fact, they are used in most of the world.\n\n**ICD-10 Criteria for Depression**\n\nThere are several items on the ICD-10 criteria for depression checklist.3 Some examples include:\n\n1.  Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day\n2.  Marked loss of interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day\n3.  Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day\n4.  Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day\n5.  Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day\n6.  Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day\n7.  Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day\n8.  Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day\n9.  Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, a suicide attempt, or a specific plan for committing suicide\n\nA diagnosis of depression requires that an individual has at least five of these symptoms for two weeks or more. Additionally, at least one of the symptoms must be either a depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure.\n\n**Types of ICD-10 Criteria for Depression**\n\nThere are multiple types of depression that can be coded using ICD-10 criteria. Below are two of the most common:\n\n1.  **Major depressive disorder (MDD):** This is the more severe form of depression and requires a person to have at least five of the symptoms listed above for two weeks or more. Additionally, at least one of the symptoms must be either a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure.\n2.  **Dysthymic Disorder:** This is a less severe form of depression and requires a person to have the symptoms listed above for two years or more. Additionally, at least one of the symptoms must be either a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure.\n\n**How the ICD-10 Criteria for Depression Are Used**\n\nThe ICD-10 criteria for depression are used in several ways:\n\n*   To diagnose patients\n*   To research the prevalence of depression and to study the course and outcome of the disorder\n*   To develop treatment plans and to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments\n\n**Tips for Using the ICD-10 Criteria for Depression**\n\nIf you are using the ICD-10 criteria for depression to diagnose a patient, it is essential to remember that the criteria are just a starting point. In order to make a diagnosis, you will need to gather more information from the patient.\n\n**Pitfalls of Using the ICD-10 Criteria for Depression**\n\nOne of the pitfalls of using the ICD-10 criteria for depression is that they are not without limitations. As mentioned above, they may misclassify some people who do not have the disorder.\n\nAdditionally, they do not take into account all of the possible manifestations of depression. Another pitfall of using the ICD-10 criteria for depression is that they are based on self-report. This means that they rely on people's ability to accurately report their own symptoms.\n\nA final pitfall of using the ICD-10 criteria for depression is that they are based on Western notions of mental illness. This means that they may not be applicable to people from other cultures.\n\n**Differences Between the ICD-10 and ICD-11 Criteria**\n\nThe ICD-11 was released in 2019, and includes some changes to the ICD-10 criteria for depression. The most notable change is that the ICD-11 no longer requires that a person has at least two weeks of depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in order to be diagnosed with depression.\n\nAdditionally, the ICD-11 includes a new category called mixed anxiety and depression. This category is for people who have symptoms of both anxiety and depression but who do not meet the criteria for either disorder. \n\n**A Word From Verywell**\n\nThe ICD-10 criteria for depression are a useful tool, but they are not perfect. If you are using them to diagnose a patient, it is essential to remember that they are just a starting point.\n\nIn order to make a diagnosis, you will need to gather more information from the patient. Additionally, keep in mind that the ICD-10 criteria for depression are based on Western notions of mental illness and may not be applicable to people from other cultures. \n\nRead More: CONDITIONS A-Z DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSIS 3 Sources\n\nBy Arlin Cuncic, MA\n\nArlin Cuncic, MA, is the author of The Anxiety Workbook and founder of the website About Social Anxiety.

You can't tell that someone is lonely just by looking at them.\n\n*   But just because someone is physically alone doesn't mean that they're lonely.\n*   The person might even enjoy that time away from others-this is what we call solitude.\n*   Loneliness, however, is always a negative feeling [because] there's something missing that we need.\n\n**Why Do We Get Lonely?**\n\nWe get lonely for many different reasons. The factors that contribute to feelings of loneliness determine the type of loneliness we're feeling at a given moment.\n\n*   Social loneliness: Feeling like you don't have anyone around; feeling like you don't belong anywhere; feeling disconnected from others\n*   Emotional loneliness: Feeling abandoned or excluded\n*   Existential loneliness: Feeling separate from the rest of the world; feeling misunderstood\n\n**The Ugly Effects of Loneliness and How to Feel Less Alone**\n\nOngoing loneliness can really do some damage to our mental and physical health.\n\n*   Increased mortality\n*   Cardiovascular disease\n*   Reduced physical activity\n*   Depression\n*   An increased risk of suicide\n*   Anxiety\n*   An increased risk of dementia\n\n**What to Do on the Days You Feel Totally Alone**\n\n1.  Decrease the stigma of being lonely: When was the last time that you said you were lonely-to yourself or someone else?\n2.  Be intentional about connecting with other people: Dr. Nobel suggests committing to a time where you make it a goal to connect with others.\n3.  Reframe the way you think about loneliness: Dr. Nobel says that feeling lonely isn't a mark on who we are.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLoneliness doesn't indicate inadequacy or some innate flaw on our part, it's just a sign that we need a little extra TLC. If you're finding that loneliness is frequent or debilitating, it may be time to reach out to a mental health professional.

Retrieved from <https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/factsheet-mental-health.pdf> Last medically reviewed on May 8, 2023\n\n\n**Arrival Fallacy: Will Reaching a Goal Make You Happy?**\n\nThe arrival fallacy is the false assumption that once you reach a goal, you will experience enduring happiness. Have you ever had the experience of working hard to reach a goal in life, only to find that once you get to the finish line, you're filled with depression and stress, rather than happiness? If so, you may be experiencing arrival fallacy.\n\nThe arrival fallacy stems from the idea ingrained into many of us since we were children that the key to happiness in life is having a good job, making lots of money, getting married, experiencing notoriety in our careers‚Äîjust generally having a forward-thinking, goal-oriented mindset. But research has shown that those sorts of things don't bring us happiness, at least not on a long-term basis.\n\n**What Causes Arrival Fallacy?**\n\nThere hasn't been much research into the arrival fallacy and what causes it, but there has been a mountain of research on what makes people happy. When you look at factors that bring people happiness, factors like having meaningful relationships and learning how to focus on the positive top the list. However, external successes like money, climbing the career ladder, and social status do not make the cut.\n\nResearch has found that these don't usually bring happiness‚Äîat least not long-term happiness. Still, society has ingrained in us the notion that happiness is very much tied to reaching goals and becoming noteworthy to others. This notion is still widespread.\n\n**Tips for Overcoming Arrival Fallacy**\n\nExperiencing arrival fallacy is fairly common, and it can be hard to cope when you find yourself depressed or stressed after reaching a long-awaited goal. Here are some tips for coping, moving through the feelings, and ultimately achieving enduring happiness in life.\n\n*   Focus on the process more than the end goal might be the key to happiness.\n*   When an employee feels as though they have achieved something on a daily basis‚Äîeven if it doesn't involve reaching a goal‚Äîthey are more likely to feel motivated and content.\n*   Work on being present in the moment by adding mindfulness into your day, such as starting a meditation practice or taking time to stop what you are doing, breathe slowly, and experience what it means to be present in your life.\n*   Take stock of the things proven to bring people happiness, such as having warm connections with others, letting go of small annoyances and inconveniences, and focusing on the simple things that make you happy.\n*   Keep a gratitude journal to concentrate more on the things that bring you joy and make them a priority in life.\n\n**A Word From Verywell**\n\nIf the arrival fallacy is something you've experienced before, or are dealing with now, you should know that you aren't alone. It's common for people to end up feeling depressed, disappointed, anxious, stressed, and even hopeless after they've reached a goal. If you are having trouble coping with your feelings, or are looking for ways to manage goal setting in the future, consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor for support.\n\n**How to Find Happiness in Your Life**\n\nRead More: CONDITIONS A-Z DEPRESSION CAUSES 10 Sources\n\nBy Wendy Wisner\nWendy Wisner is a health and parenting writer, lactation consultant (IBCLC), and mom to two awesome sons.

Genetics: Over 80 genetic variants have been linked to depression.\n2.  Hormones: Fluctuations in hormone production or function, such as those related to pregnancy, menstruation, menopause, or thyroid disorders, can contribute to depression.\n3.  Seasonal changes: Disruptions in the body's circadian rhythm at different times of the year can trigger seasonal affective disorder (SAD).\n4.  Stress and trauma: The loss of a loved one, abuse, chronic stress, and big life changes can trigger depression.\n5.  Substance use: Depression rates are higher among people with a history of substance use.\n\n**It Is More Than Sadness**\n\nDepression is an illness that extends beyond ordinary sadness, with symptoms including:\n\n*   Changes in appetite, weight, and sleep patterns\n*   Difficulty concentrating, remembering things, or making decisions\n*   Feeling anxious, hopeless, or helpless\n*   Irritability or restlessness\n*   Persistent feelings of sadness or emptiness\n*   Physical symptoms such as headaches, digestive issues, body aches,", "category": "general"},

If you have been diagnosed with depression or are experiencing depressive symptoms, it is normal to wonder if antidepressants work or if they can even cure your condition. If you're wondering whether antidepressants will cure you in the same way that an antibiotic cures an infection, the answer is no; they do not eradicate the underlying causes of depression. There is a lot that we still don't know about antidepressants, or depression in general. While antidepressants can alter neurotransmitter levels and function in the brain, they may not cause permanent changes in brain structure or chemistry.\n\n**Do Antidepressants Work?**\n\n*   Depression is a serious medical condition that requires treatment.\n*   Antidepressants are effective for many people with depression.\n*   There are different types of antidepressants, each working slightly differently.\n\n**How Antidepressants Work**\n\n1.  Antidepressants target one or more neurotransmitters involved in regulating mood.\n2.  These neurotransmitters include serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.\n3.  The effects on these neurotransmitters can vary depending on the type of antidepressant.\n4.  Some help the brain use neurotransmitters more effectively, while others increase neurotransmitter levels.\n\n**Antidepressants and Long-Term Effects**\n\n*   Antidepressants do not provide a permanent cure for depression.\n*   Their effects are temporary and will return to normal when stopped.\n*   Despite this, antidepressants can still provide long-term relief from depressive symptoms.\n*   Research suggests that depressed adults who use antidepressants are three times less likely to remain depressed after eight years.\n\n**Tips for Taking Antidepressants**\n\n1.  Give your medication enough time to work before giving up on it (usually 2-8 weeks).\n2.  Take your antidepressant exactly as prescribed by your doctor.\n3.  Don't stop taking your medication without consulting your doctor first.\n4.  Be patient and don't give up if the first medication doesn't help.\n\n**Long-term Use of Antidepressants**\n\n*   Your risk for depression relapse plays a significant role in determining whether you need to stay on antidepressants long-term.\n*   Factors like having multiple depressive episodes, a familial history of depression, or severe depressive episodes can affect your treatment plan.\n*   Research is ongoing to better understand the effects of long-term antidepressant use and how to minimize potential side effects.\n\n**A Word From Verywell**\n\n*   Antidepressants are effective and considered a first-line treatment for moderate to severe depression.\n*   Other treatments, such as psychotherapy, can be helpful in conjunction with medication.\n*   Consult your doctor or mental healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment for you.", "category": "general"},

It's a way of crying out for help.\n*   **They may be afraid of what might happen if they don't make an attempt**: They may be afraid of what other people will think or say if they don't go through with it, or they may be afraid that they'll never have the courage to try again.\n*   **They may have unresolved trauma or dangling loose ends in their life**: Some people experience deep shame and guilt over past traumatic experiences, and it seems they can't escape their wounds or find adequate solutions.\n*   **They may have an undiagnosed mental illness**: Mental illness can cause mood swings and periods of highs and lows. Just because someone appears to be doing well doesn't mean that they're not struggling with mental health issues.\n*   **They may feel like others will be better off without them**: Even though things may have seemed better for a while, they feel like there's no point in trying anymore because nothing will ever change.\n*   **They may not have a support system in place to help them through difficult times**: When people are feeling suicidal, they often feel like they're all alone in the world and that no one cares about them.\n*   **They may have been holding it together for others**: In addition, they may finally have the strength to attempt suicide after years of holding it together for the sake of others.\n*   **Someone may have already decided that they will commit suicide**: They seem OK because they know relief is coming.\n\n**Crisis Support**\n\nIf you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nIf you or someone you know appears to be feeling better after a period of stress, it's essential to be aware that this doesn't mean that they're no longer at risk for suicide. In fact, this may actually be a warning sign. If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please reach out for help.\n\n**Tips for Coping with Depression and Suicidal Thoughts**\n\nRead More: CONDITIONS A-Z DEPRESSION SUICIDE\n\nReferences:\n\n1  **National Institute of Mental Health**: Suicide Rates Per 100,000 People.\n2  **JAMA Psychiatry**: Associations Between Recent Financial Stress and Risk of Suicide Attempts in the US Population. \n3  **PLOS ONE**: The Relationship Between Depression Severity and Suicidal Ideation Among Adults with Major Depressive Disorder. \n4  **Journal of Clinical Psychology**: Predictors of Suicidal Behavior in Adults with a History of Childhood Trauma. \n\n**Meet Our Review Board**\n\nTo ensure the accuracy and reliability of our content, we have assembled a team of experts who review and fact-check our articles.\n\n*   Meet our editorial board members\n*   Learn about our peer-review process\n\n**Share Feedback on This Article**\n\nHelp us improve our content by sharing your thoughts and feedback.

Having negative thoughts and beliefs\n\nEffective treatments for PTSD include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), exposure therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).\n\n**Treatment**\nThere are a number of treatments that can help reduce or eliminate PTSD symptoms.\n\n1.  Antidepressants\n2.  Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)\n3.  Cognitive processing therapy\n4.  Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)\n\n**Helping Someone with PTSD**\nOne way you can help a loved one with PTSD is to learn about the symptoms and the challenges of living with the condition.\n\n*   Encourage your loved one to seek help from a trained professional.\n*   Unaddressed symptoms of PTSD can become more severe over time, so it is essential to try and help them find resources to begin the healing process.\n\n**Disability**\nIf you are unable to work in the field for which you are trained due to your PTSD symptoms, you may qualify for disability benefits. If your condition is due to military service, you may qualify for veteran's benefits. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) also requires reasonable accommodations for people who have PTSD and have a record of impairment due to their condition.\n\n**Trigger**\nA trigger is something that can remind someone of a traumatic experience.\n\n*   Internal triggers: feelings or emotions\n*   External triggers: situations, people, places, or objects\n\nWhen such triggers are present, people may be reminded of the event or even feel as if they are re-experiencing the trauma all over again. Recognizing and coping with PTSD triggers can help individuals manage their symptoms.\n\n**Intrusive Memories**\nIntrusive memories involve emotionally-linked images or impressions that come to mind involuntarily. For those with PTSD, such memories center on a traumatic event and can be extremely disruptive and distressing.\n\n*   Treatments often focus on helping people more effectively process and restructure these intrusive traumatic memories.\n\n**Hyperarousal**\nHyperarousal is a set of symptoms of PTSD that happens when people go into a high state of alert after their trauma. Even when there is no real danger present, people may respond as if they are facing a very real threat.\n\n*   Symptoms include:\n    1.  Startling easily\n    2.  Irritability\n    3.  Anxiety\n    4.  Difficulty sleeping\n    5.  Panic attacks\n    6.

Mental health professionals typically conceptualize this through the lens of fight, flight, freeze, or fawn.\n\n*   These responses are involuntary functions of our autonomic nervous system and take hold when we are faced with a traumatic experience.\n\n**Complex PTSD**\nTrauma that is repeated and ongoing, such as child abuse or domestic violence, can lead to a condition known as complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD).\n\n*   In addition to other symptoms of PTSD, people with complex PTSD also have difficulty with emotions, hold negative self-perceptions, struggle with relationships, and may feel detached from the trauma.\n\n**Key Terms**\nTrigger\nPsychiatric Disorder\nIntrusive Memories\nHyperarousal\nPsychological Evaluation\nTrauma Response\nComplex PTSD\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n*   What causes PTSD?\n    *   There are a number of factors that can play a role in how people respond to traumatic events.\n    *   Genetics, for example, can influence how people handle stress during and after a trauma.\n*   How is PTSD treated?\n    *   There are a number of treatments that can help reduce or eliminate PTSD symptoms.\n    *   Antidepressants are sometimes prescribed to reduce symptoms of PTSD and manage symptoms of depression and anxiety if present.\n\n**Explore Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder**\nThere are several resources available for those looking to learn more about PTSD:\n\n*   How Trauma Can Affect Your Window of Tolerance\n*   The 8 Best Online Psychiatry Services That Take Insurance, Tried and Tested\n*   What Is Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG)?\n*   Understanding ADHD and Trauma\n*   What to Know About PTSD in Teenagers\n*   How to Cope With Sibling Grief\n\n**Page Sources**\n\n1.

Narcolepsy\n5. Sleep Apnea\n\n**Lucid Dream**\n\nA lucid dream occurs when a person is asleep but aware that they are dreaming. In this state, a person can take control of their dream's narrative to some degree, essentially guiding and directing the course of their dream.\n\nWhat Is a Lucid Dream?\n\n**Insomnia**\n\nInsomnia is a common sleep disorder that affects millions of Americans. This often unrelenting condition can impact sleep in multiple ways, including causing difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, waking up too early (and not being able to fall back asleep), and poor sleep quality.\n\nWhat Is Insomnia?\n\n**REM**\n\nRapid eye movement (REM) sleep is one of the four stages that the brain goes through during the sleep cycle. This period of the sleep cycle usually takes place about 90 minutes after a person first falls asleep. It is marked by a number of physiological changes that include muscle relaxation, eye movement, faster respiration, and increased brain activity.\n\nWhat Is REM Sleep?\n\n**Narcolepsy**\n\nNarcolepsy is a sleep disorder that is characterized by chronic, excessive daytime sleepiness. It is a neurological condition that impacts the brain's ability to manage the sleep-wake cycle. People who have this condition usually have a difficult time staying awake for extended periods of time, no matter what time it is or what they are doing.\n\nWhat Is Narcolepsy?\n\n**Sleep Apnea**\n\nSleep apnea is a common condition in which people stop breathing multiple times during the night due to upper airway obstruction. Because people briefly stop breathing, sometimes for 10 seconds or longer, their heart rate increases, blood oxygen levels drop, and sleep is briefly disrupted as the person wakes in order to breathe.\n\nReasons You're Not Sleeping Well\n\n**EXPLORE SLEEP AND DREAMING**\n\nI Tried Reading for 30 Minutes Before Bed for a Week-Here's What Happened\n\nI Tried Using a Red Light Filter on My Phone to Beat Doomscrolling -Did It Work?\n\nThis Underrated Hack Is the Simple Secret to Better Sleep\n\nI Drank Tart Cherry Juice Before Bed for a Week-Here's What It Did for My Sleep\n\nWhy Sleep Disturbance and Atopic Dermatitis (AD) Go Hand in Hand\n\n7 Foods to Help You Get a Great Night's Sleep\n\nWhen Dreams Merge With Your Waking Life-What to Know About Deja Reve\n\nThe Drunken Monkey Sleep Hack Might Be a TikTok Trend Worth Trying\n\nWhat Does It Mean to Dream About Being Chased?\n\nWhat Are My Precognitive Dreams Trying to Tell Me?\n\nWhy It's Harder to Sleep As You Age\n\nHow Sleep Can Affect Your Longevity\n\nCan a Better Night's Sleep Boost Your Memory?\n\nHow to Stop Nightmares From Terrorizing Your Sleep\n\nWhat Do Dreams About Tornadoes Mean?\n\nWhy You Should Try Sleeping Nude Tonight, According to Science\n\nWhat Does It Mean When You Dream About Getting Shot?\n\nWhat Does It Mean to Have a Fever Dream?\n\nMicrosleep No More: How to Prevent Brief Sleep Episodes\n\nWhat Does It Mean to Dream About Spiders?\n\nWhy Am I Naked in My Dreams Sometimes?\n\nWhat Does It Mean to Dream of Your Teeth Falling Out?\n\nWhat Happens to Your Body When You Hit The Snooze Button?\n\nWhat Does It Mean When You Dream About Being Back in School?\n\nWhat Does It Mean to Dream of Your Partner Cheating on You?\n\nWhat Does It Mean When You Dream of Someone Who Passed Away?\n\nPartner's Snores Keeping You Up?

Examples\n2.  Mental Health Effects\n3.  What Makes Liminal Spaces So Unsettling?\n4.  How to Cope With Liminal Spaces\n\n**Examples**\n\n*   A physical liminal space is perhaps the easiest to understand.\n*   You are in physical liminal spaces all the time, but typically, you often don't notice them because you're only there for fleeting moments.\n*   Think of a staircase.\n*   It takes you from one floor to another, and you often don't think twice about your time on a staircase.\n*   But what about if you get stuck in a stairwell?\n*   Then, visions of horror movies might start racing through your head.\n\n**Mental Health Effects**\n\nBeing in a liminal space can be incredibly uncomfortable for most people. Our brains crave homeostasis and predictability, and the liminal space is everything but. When faced with this uncertainty of how to proceed, you are thrown between where you have come from and where you are going.\n\n*   The key to making our way through these liminal spaces-physical, psychological, or emotional-can be tough.\n*   Whether you are moving to a new city, starting a new job, or experiencing some other big life transition, the in-between moments of our lives often create feelings of anxiety and uncertainty.\n*   But they can be opportunities for growth.\n\n**What Makes Liminal Spaces So Unsettling?**\n\nIt's more than just the fear of uncertainty. It becomes the fear that one will not have the emotional resources to cope. This leads to avoidant behaviors such as substance use or self-harm. Additionally, the fear of uncertainty may flood your body with stress hormones, making it even harder to come up for air.\n\n*   If existing in the liminal space becomes too much for you to deal with on your own, you might want to find a therapist to help you learn healthy ways to cope.\n*   On the other hand, beauty can lie in liminal spaces.\n*   Think of liminal spaces in architecture, like a beautiful atrium in the entryway of a museum.\n*   Liminality also can be an opportunity for transformation.\n*   It might not have been the path you would have chosen, but it is the path you are on now.\n\n**How to Cope With Liminal Spaces**\n\nWe all deal with liminal space at one point or another. And making our way through these liminal spaces-physical, psychological, or emotional-can be tough. Whether you are moving to a new city, starting a new job, or experiencing some other big life transition, the in-between moments of our lives often create feelings of anxiety and uncertainty.\n\n*   Creating comforting routines that provide stability and using effective stress management techniques can help you focus on personal growth while reducing the distress you might experience as you make the transition.\n*   Create Routines\n    *   Maintaining a routine when you are dealing with a stressful transition can provide a sense of stability and security.\n    *   Such routines help you feel grounded and connected to important parts of your life while providing a base for you to explore new things.\n*   Practice Mindfulness\n    *   Much of the distress associated with being in a transitional period comes from fear or catastrophizing what might happen.\n    *   So, stop for a moment to take stock of where you are right now.\n    *   What does uncertainty feel like in your body?\n    *   Then, observe your breath coming in and out as you remind yourself that you are OK in this moment.\n*   Embrace Your Current State\n    *   Although the uncertainty of being in a liminal space may be challenging, you must accept that it is where you are now.\n    *   The principles of dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) can help you understand that, although you can't control all circumstances, you can control your own thoughts, feelings, and reactions.\n*   Get Creative\n    *   Much of our entertainment and literature follows the hero's journey-essentially, something happens, the hero goes on a journey following that event, and it profoundly changes them. Yet, whether it be fictitious or true-to-life, creativity might flourish in times of uncertainty.\n    *   So, you might want to write or draw to express what it feels like to be in a liminal space.\n    *   Research has shown that expressive arts therapy can be an effective way to feel calmer and less stressed.8\n\n**Takeaways**\n\nLiminal spaces can create feelings of uneasiness and anxiety, but they can also be opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Regardless of where you're at in life at the moment, you still have the opportunities to learn new things and discover more about yourself.\n\n*   If you're really struggling during a period of transition, please reach out to a trained mental health professional.\n*   Journaling to Cope With Anxiety Read More: CONDITIONS A-Z DEPRESSION CAUSES 7 Sources By Theodora Blanchfield, AMFT Theodora Blanchfield is an Associate Marriage and Family Therapist and mental health writer using her experiences to help others.

It belongs to a class of drugs known as anticonvulsants. It works by decreasing the brain's vulnerability to having seizures and can also help to reduce pain.\n\n*   Neurontin is available as a generic medication sold under the name gabapentin.\n*   It comes in two forms: tablets or an oral solution.\n\n**Uses for Neurontin**\n\nNeurontin is approved by the FDA for the treatment of the following conditions:\n\n1.  Seizures: This medication is used to reduce the occurrence of seizures in children and adults with epilepsy.\n2.  Postherpetic neuralgia: Postherptic neuralgia is a condition that causes persistent nerve pain in people who have had shingles.\n\n**Off-Label Uses**\n\nNeurontin is sometimes prescribed off-label for the treatment of the following conditions:\n\n*   Bipolar disorder\n*   Fibromyalgia\n*   Migraines\n*   Anxiety\n\n**Before Taking Neurontin**\n\nBefore taking this medicine, you should go over the list of active and inactive ingredients with your doctor to make sure you are not allergic to any ingredient in it. Gabapentin is the active ingredient in Neurontin.\n\n*   Signs of an allergic reaction to gabapentin include swelling of the tongue, throat, or face, hives, and difficulty breathing.\n*   If you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant while taking this medication, please inform your doctor.\n*   There is not a lot of data on the effects of Neurotonin in pregnancy, and it's generally avoided if possible.\n\n**Side Effects of Neurontin**\n\nSome people might experience adverse effects while using Neurontin. Most are mild and will go away with time. In rare cases, these side effects might be more severe or worsen.\n\n*   Common side effects include insomnia, anxiety, mood swings, headache, dizziness, tiredness, nausea and vomiting in children.\n*   Severe side effects include difficulty breathing, extreme fatigue, confusion, and extreme drowsiness.\n\n**Neurontin Warnings and Interactions**\n\nThis medication can cause drowsiness, and taking alcohol alongside this medication can worsen this side effect. If you are about to go in for any kind of surgery, including dental surgery, inform your doctor that you are currently taking Neurontin.\n\n*   This medication might also make you lose coordination and slow down your reflexes.\n*   You shouldn't drive or operate heavy machinery until you've monitored how this medication affects you. Watch out for changes in moods and behaviors if you have a child who's taking Neurontin.\n*   They might experience sudden mood swings, become more hyperactive, or have difficulty paying attention.\n\n**Neurontin Dosage**\n\nYour doctor is most likely to consider a couple of things when deciding your dosage for Neurontin. They'll consider the severity of your condition, other medications you might be taking, and your tolerability (the degree to which a patient can handle adverse effects of a particular treatment).\n\n*   The manufacturer also recommends the following dosages for these conditions:\n    *   Epileptic seizures: An initial dose of 300 milligrams is given on day one, 300 milligrams twice a day on day two, and 300 milligrams three times a day on day three.\n    *   Nerve pain: As with epilepsy, an initial dose of 300 milligrams is given on day one, 300 milligrams twice a day on day two, and 300 milligrams three times a day on day three.\n\n**How to Take and Store Neurontin**\n\nNeurontin can be taken with or without food. Swallow any pill you take whole, without chewing or crushing it.\n\n*   If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, but if it's time for your next dose, skip the missed dose-don't double your dose.\n*   In many cases, Neurontin is prescribed to be taken three times a day. You shouldn't take all three doses at once or close together.\n\n**Neurontin Withdrawal**\n\nStopping Neurontin abruptly could cause withdrawal symptoms like tremors, high blood pressure, and gastrointestinal problems. Do not stop taking your medication without talking to your doctor first. They may recommend gradually tapering your dose over time to minimize potential withdrawal effects. 12 Sources By Toketemu Ohwovoriole Reviewed by Steven Gans, MD What To Know About Neurontin (Gabapentin) Read More: CONDITIONS A-Z BIPOLAR DISORDER TREATMENT 12 Sources By Toketemu Ohwovoriole Toketemu has been multimedia storyteller for the last four years.

It's not uncommon for people with depression to struggle with feelings of anger, irritability, or withdrawal. These behaviors are symptoms of the illness and not personal attacks on you. By Nancy Schimelpfening Updated on November 09, 2023 Medically reviewed by Amy Morin, LCSW Verywell Ellen Linder Learn More About Depression Understand What Depression Really Means Practice Self-Care Seek Therapy Be There for Your Partner Don't Take Your Partner's Depression Personally Help Out With Chores Encourage Your Partner to Seek Treatment Offer Hope Demonstrate Your Love Frequently Asked Questions If you are in a relationship with someone who has depression, you are likely struggling with a mix of emotions and lots of questions. For instance, you might wonder: What does depression feel like for my partner? What can I do to help support them? How can I take care of myself? Will their symptoms impact our relationship and, if so, how can we navigate any issues together? All of these questions are normal and it's understandable that you'd want to support your loved one to the best of your ability. While your questions are valid, it's also important to understand that every person's experience with depression is unique so here are a few things you can do to help your loved one and yourself. 8 Ways to Provide Emotional Support for Your Partner Learn More About Depression You can support your loved one by learning everything you can about depression, including its causes, symptoms, and treatments. Ask your partner's doctor for some sources that provide the facts about depression, or do your own search. Start with these reputable sources: Anxiety and Depression Association of America Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance Mental Health America National Alliance on Mental Illness National Institute of Mental Health An Overview of Clinical Depression Understand What Depression Really Means There are many myths about depression. For example, depression is not simply the result of laziness or weakness. Your partner's pain may not just be in their head. Depression doesn't need a reason. If you are unfamiliar with depression, challenge preconceived thoughts, ideas, and stigma by educating yourself. It's especially important to validate your partner's feelings and experience of this very real and biologically based illness. Know that just like any other illness, it can be treated.1 Suicide is also a very real risk of depression, so it's important to keep your loved one's environment safe (such as removing any alcohol, drugs, or guns) and to take it seriously if your loved one is feeling suicidal. If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. Practice Self-Care It can be very stressful coping with another person's depression. It's OK to take some time out for yourself. Self-care is not selfish. In fact, you'll both be better off if you carve out time to safeguard your mind, body, and spirit with habits like: Eating a healthy diet Exercising Getting enough sleep Participating in hobbies and activities you enjoy Praying or meditating Practicing relaxation strategies Spending time in nature Staying socially connected Caring for yourself might also mean knowing when it's time to say goodbye. Certainly, this decision should be weighed carefully (and ideally, discussed with a mental health professional). But if your or your children's emotional or physical well-being or safety is at risk, you may need to walk away. Seek Therapy When someone you care about is depressed, it's OK for you to feel frustrated, angry, and upset. It is very important, however, that you don't allow these feelings to fester and grow. Therapists, counselors, and support groups are not only for people with depression. Seeking professional help for yourself can help you feel supported, vent your frustrations, and make you more aware of your own emotional needs. Therapy can also provide answers to any questions you have about coping with the depression of a loved one. Even if you don't go the mental health professional route, it's important to lean on your support network during this difficult time. Get Help Now We've tried, tested, and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, BetterHelp, and ReGain. Find out which option is the best for you. Should I Ask My Partner About Their Therapy Sessions? Be There for Your Partner One of the most important things you can do for someone who is depressed is simply to be there for them and verbalize your support. Hold them close or just listen while they share their feelings. Offer to help them with making appointments or doing some of the daily chores that they are struggling to keep up with. Let them know that you are there for them in whatever way they need while they make their recovery.

{"title": "What to Know About Childhood Depression", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/childhood-depression-1066805", "content": "on This Article Did you find what you were looking for? Yes No   What to Know About Childhood Depression\n**Childhood Depression: A Guide**\n \n**Overview**\n\nAlthough most people think of depression as an adult illness, children and adolescents can develop depression as well. Unfortunately, many children with depression go untreated because adults don't recognize they're depressed.\n\n*   It's essential for parents, teachers, and other adults to learn about childhood depression.\n*   Understanding the symptoms of depression in children and the reasons children develop it can help intervene in a helpful manner.\n\n**How Children Experience Depression**\n\nDepression in children and teens usually presents differently than it does in adults. Young children often find it difficult to explain their feelings and may regress to earlier behaviors such as thumb-sucking or bed-wetting. They may have more nightmares and difficulty sleeping. Irritability and or anger are more common signs of depression in older children and teens.\n\n*   Children with family members who also have mood disorders, such as depression, are at a greater risk of experiencing these symptoms.\n*   Brain chemistry imbalances and environmental factors can contribute to feelings of depression.\n\n**Causes of Childhood Depression**\n\nWhile stressful life events, like divorce, may contribute to depression, it's only a small piece of the puzzle. Many other factors, including genetics, differences in neurological or physical development, major illness, and other psychosocial factors, also play a role in its onset.\n\n*   Family history: Genetics play a significant role in creating a predisposition for mood disorders.\n*   Brain chemistry: Imbalances in certain neurotransmitters and hormones may play a role in how the brain works, which can affect moods and emotions and increase the risk of experiencing depression.\n*   Environmental factors: A stressful, chaotic, or unstable home environment can also make children more likely to experience depression.\n\n**Diagnosing Childhood Depression**\n\nIf you think your child is showing signs of depression, schedule an appointment with your child's pediatrician to discuss your concerns. Before arriving at a diagnosis, your child should undergo a comprehensive physical evaluation to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the symptoms you are seeing.\n\n*   A doctor may use one or multiple psychological assessments to further evaluate the type and severity of depression your child is experiencing.\n*   Classification of Depression: When your child is diagnosed with a depressive disorder, it is typically classified by severity:\n    *   Mild\n    *   Moderate\n    *   Severe (also called major or clinical depression)\n\n**Treatment for Childhood Depression**\n\nFor mild cases of depression, lifestyle changes can often be an effective way to address feelings of depression. For adolescents with moderate to severe depression, research has shown that a combination of psychotherapy and medication works best.\n\n*   Psychotherapy: Helps improve a child's mood by identifying negative thought and behavior patterns and replacing them with positive ones.\n*   Medications: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered the first-line antidepressant option for young people with depression. Only two SSRIs-Prozac (fluoxetine) and Lexapro (escitalopram)-are FDA-approved for use in young people with depression.\n\n**Coping**\n\nFor mild cases of depression, lifestyle changes can often be an effective way to address feelings of depression. Things like finding ways to manage stress, getting regular physical exercise, using relaxation techniques, developing new hobbies and interests, and building a stronger social support system can help improve how a child feels.\n\n*   Encourage healthy coping skills and support mental health by talking about the importance of self-care.\n*   Help your child develop a rich social life without over-scheduling their time. Assign responsibilities and reward them when they follow through. Teach your child how to identify their feelings and their needs and how to manage their emotions in healthy ways.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nChildhood depression can have a serious impact on a child's life, so it is always important to be on the lookout for warning signs that your child may be depressed. Talk to your child about their feelings, and be careful to remain supportive and non-judgmental. Thankfully, early interventions can help kids get back on track before symptoms of depression take a serious toll on their lives and ability to function.

The disorder is more prevalent among women than men and among younger people (aged 18-25) than older people. In 2020, 14.8 million adults had a severe episode of unipolar depression.\n\n**Unipolar vs. Bipolar Depression**\n\nThe term unipolar depression is used to distinguish major depressive disorder from bipolar disorder, which is characterized by alternating periods of mania and depression. Sometimes bipolar disorder is misdiagnosed as unipolar depression.\n\n**Characteristics and Symptoms of Unipolar Depression**\n\nExperiencing unipolar depression, or major depressive disorder, is different from feeling sad and down from time to time. Unipolar depression is characterized by feelings of depression that are persistent, intense, and that make it challenging for you to function normally or relate to others.\n\n*   Feeling sad most days or having a chronic low mood\n*   Not enjoying activities that used to bring you pleasure\n*   Finding it difficult to experience joy or happiness\n*   Feeling emotionally numb\n*   Having trouble concentrating\n*   Lack of energy\n*   Noticeable changes in hunger\n*   Trouble sleeping\n*   Feeling agitated\n*   Having trouble completing tasks\n*   Feeling like you don't matter\n*   Feeling guilty\n*   Experiencing thoughts of suicide or self-harm\n\n**Diagnosis of Unipolar Depression**\n\nIn order to receive a diagnosis of unipolar depression, you will need to be evaluated by a doctor or psychiatrist. Evaluations for depression often include a physical exam, a medical and family history questionnaire, and bloodwork to look for markers of disease.\n\n*   Sometimes other medical conditions are confused with unipolar depression, including thyroid or hormonal disorders, so it's important to rule those out.\n*   According to the DSM-5-TR, in order to be diagnosed with unipolar depression (major depressive disorder), you need to have had symptoms of a depressive episode for two weeks or more and experience five or more of the following symptoms:\n    *   Depressed mood (or irritable mood in children)\n    *   Little to no interest in activities that used to give you pleasure\n    *   A noticeable change in appetite or weight\n    *   Challenging sleep issues\n    *   An inability to stop moving (agitation) or acting extremely sluggish\n    *   Low energy, inability to concentrate, and fatigue\n    *   Feelings of intense worthlessness, self-blame, and guilt\n    *   Trouble thinking clearly or making everyday decisions\n    *   Thoughts of death or suicide\n\n**Causes of Unipolar Depression**\n\nThere are several factors that contribute to unipolar depression.

In addition to experiencing sadness, birthday depression can also include a sense of low energy or focusing on the past, including everything that you may or may not have accomplished so far.\n\n**Birthday Depression and Other Mental Health Conditions**\n\nOur diagnostic manual (DSM-5) does not recognize birthday depression as a mental health disorder, says Dr. Ernesto Lira de la Rosa, PhD, a licensed clinical psychologist and member of the media advisory group at the Hope for Depression Research Foundation. However, he notes that this does not mean that individuals don't experience depression or sadness during a birthday.\n\n1.  It could be associated with other mental health disorders, such as depression or anxiety.\n2.  For individuals who have a history of depression, it would not be uncommon for them to experience sadness around their birthdays as well.\n\n**Potential Causes and Reasons**\n\nFor some, it could be tied to previous negative experiences with birthdays. Others may reflect on their lives and may not feel they are where they wanted to be by that specific age, says Dr. Lira de la Rosa. For others, birthdays can come during times when they are going through something difficult.\n\n1.  Depression (it's estimated that 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. have received a diagnosis of depression in their lifetime)\n2.  Anxiety\n3.  Fear of getting old\n4.  History of family drama on birthdays during childhood\n\n**Symptoms**\n\nDr. Lira de la Rosa says many of the symptoms related to birthday depression are similar to symptoms of regular depression. So, how can you know if you have birthday depression? Certain signs may alert you that you are experiencing the birthday blues, including but not limited to the following:\n\n1.  A change in your mood that persists and lasts for several days surrounding your birthday\n2.  Feeling more low, down, or sad than usual\n3.  Crying more often than usual\n4.  Ruminating on the past and goals unaccomplished (e.g., not getting married or having kids yet)\n5.  Stressing about how much time you have left to live\n6.  Not having much energy or motivation to do things\n7.  Lack of interest in doing what you typically enjoy\n8.  Changes in sleep\n9.  Changes in appetite\n10. Difficulty focusing or concentrating\n11. Physical aches or pains\n12. Wanting to avoid the actual day of your birthday\n13. Disinterest in celebrating your birthday (e.g., rejecting or refusing plans to celebrate with friends or family)\n14. Desire to isolate yourself\n\n**How to Cope With Birthday Depression**\n\nThere are different treatments and coping mechanisms to choose from that may help to heal your birthday blues and simply ease any negative feelings.\n\n1.  Allow Your Emotions to Arise\n2.  Practice Awareness and Self-Compassion\n3.  Talk About Your Experience With Someone You Trust\n4.  Celebrate However You Feel Comfortable\n5.  Prepare for Your Birthday With Healthy Activities\n6.  Speak to a Therapist\n\n**A Word From Verywell**\n\nAlthough birthdays are typically associated with happy feelings and positive experiences, this may not be the case for everybody. If you experience birthday depression, please don't feel ashamed. It's very common and normal for people to feel sad around their birthday. However, if your birthday depression leads to extreme feelings of sadness, anxiety, or isolation, you may want to consult a mental health professional for help.", "category": "general"},

This condition is prevalent on college campuses, affecting an estimated 53% of students at some point.\n\nCollege students are a vulnerable population who are faced with a range of new and often wonderful-yet sometimes stressful-experiences, explains Randall Dwenger, MD, the chief medical officer at Mountainside Treatment Center. He also notes that people who have a predisposition to depression typically start to display symptoms during their early 20s.\n\nDepression can take a toll on many aspects of a young person's life, including academic performance, social life, and physical health. It can also increase their risk of substance abuse and co-occurring mental health conditions. For this reason, it is crucial to recognize the signs of depression in college students and provide tools, resources, and support that can help.\n\n**Symptoms of Depression in College Students**\n\nEven mild symptoms may significantly interfere with academic and social functioning, explains Amy Mezulis, PhD, a licensed clinical psychologist and chief clinical officer of Joon. She also notes that it can lead to symptoms such as trouble concentrating, fatigue, and low energy, which can make it tough for students to keep up with academic work.\n\nSome common symptoms of depression in college students include:\n\n*   Feeling sad, low, or empty\n*   Loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities\n*   Difficulty concentrating and making decisions\n*   Missing class\n*   Poor grades\n*   Not having the motivation to finish assignments\n*   Poor self-care and personal hygiene\n*   Using drugs or alcohol to cope with difficult emotions\n*   Irritability or restlessness\n*   Guilt, helplessness, or hopelessness\n*   Lack of energy or fatigue\n*   Feelings of worthlessness\n*   Reduced physical activity\n*   Changes in sleep habits and appetite\n*   Thoughts of self-harm or suicide\n\n**What Percentage of College Students Experience Depression?**\n\nDepression rates among U.S. college students are at an all-time high and growing. According to one internet-based survey, 44% reported that they currently have symptoms of depression, and 15% said they had considered suicide in the past year.\n\nA 2022 study published in the Journal of Affective Disorders examined data from the national Healthy Minds study between the years 2013 and 2021. The researchers found that there has been a steady, consistent decline in the mental health of college students throughout the United States, amounting to a 135% increase in depression over the course of those eight years.\n\n**What Really Causes Depression in College Students?**\n\nLeaving home for the first time can be an exciting but also challenging time for many students. It can be a time of self-discovery and personal growth, but it can also be stressful, anxiety-provoking, and isolating for many. The following are just some of the common factors that can play a role in the onset of depression among college-age students.\n\n*   Transitions and Adjustments\n*   Relationships and Social Pressures\n*   Financial Stress\n*   Poor Sleep\n*   Substance Use\n*   Other Hurdles\n\n**Impact of Depression on Academic and Personal Life**\n\nThe high rates of depression among college students negatively affect physical health, mental well-being, academic success, and interpersonal relationships. These effects can be distressing and far-reaching.\n\nDepression can lead to poor test performance and bad grades, which even jeopardize a student's ability to graduate and, for those depending on academic scholarships, impair their ability to keep their form of financial support.\n\nDepression also makes it more challenging for students to enjoy many of the experiences that are often associated with college. Extracurricular activities, social events, and hobbies that they used to enjoy lose their appeal. This often means that they stop participating in these activities altogether.\n\n**Coping With Depression in College**\n\nIf you are a college student struggling with depression, there are a few things that you can do that may help make it easier to cope. Make a plan for how you'll take care of your mental health before college begins. Brainstorm ways to tackle challenges such as finding community, adjusting to living in a new place away from family and friends, keeping up with a different level of academic work, or getting the right amount of good nutrition, exercise, and sleep.\n\nTry behavioral activation, which involves scheduling activities that help promote a positive mood and well-being, even if you might not necessarily feel in the mood. This includes scheduling things like social events, exercise, and even daily tasks like doing your laundry and homework.\n\n**Treatments for Depression in College Students**\n\nWhile there are many strategies you can use on your own to improve your mental health and ability to cope, it is important to seek professional help if your symptoms have lasted longer than two weeks and or are making it difficult to function in your daily life. Treatment options can include on- or off-campus options.\n\nTalking to a mental health professional at your school's counseling center or student health services can be a great place to start. They can provide further options about mental health services that are available on-campus or refer you to off-campus providers.\n\nYour doctor or therapist may recommend a few different options to treat your depression. Because depression is complex and influenced by a number of factors, research suggests that a combination of therapy and medication is often the most effective treatment approach.\n\nTherapy can help you gain insights, improve relationships, and develop new coping skills. Medication can help people find relief from symptoms of depression. Antidepressants that are commonly prescribed include Prozac (fluoxetine), Paxil (paroxetine), Zoloft (sertraline), Celexa (citalopram), and Lexapro (escitalopram).\n\n**Resources**\n\nIf you are experiencing depression, there are many resources available to help you. These include:\n\n*   Student Support Services: Offers a range of services for academic and personal development and may provide counseling services\n*   Counseling Center: Provides counseling services to students experiencing mental health concerns\n*   Student Health Center: Offers a variety of health services to students, including mental health care\n*   Psychology Clinic: Provides psychological services to students and community members\n\nSome colleges and universities also offer teletherapy services. Other places to turn if you are experiencing depression include your resident advisor (RA), academic advisor, a trusted professor, or campus helpline.\n\n**How Schools Can Help**\n\nEvery college should have a comprehensive plan designed to address aspects of student mental health. Such plans should include strategies", "category": "general"},

While it's often experienced by mothers, it can also be experienced by fathers.\n\n*   The presence of a new child is a major life change.\n*   Fathers, like mothers, need to pay attention to their mental health.\n*   Exhaustion and stress, in addition to other factors, can lead to male postpartum depression.\n\n**The Effects of Postpartum Depression**\n\nFeeling exhausted, overwhelmed, and stressed following the birth of a child is a normal aspect of parenthood. Still, if symptoms persist or if they interfere with daily life or the ability to care for the child, then it could be postpartum depression.\n\n*   This is true for both mothers and fathers.\n*   Many postpartum depression symptoms are synonymous with a major depressive disorder.\n*   Symptoms vary from person to person.\n*   You may experience some, not all, and they can vary in degree.\n\n**The Underdiagnosis of PPD in Men**\n\nWomen are often screened by their doctor for postpartum depression, but men typically aren't. They are also more likely to underreport their symptoms, which is why postpartum depression in men can go undiagnosed and untreated.\n\n*   If you're a new father experiencing persistent and ongoing symptoms of depression, you'll want to notify your partner, doctor, and or mental health professional.\n*   Depression doesn't go away on its own, so the sooner you're diagnosed, the sooner you can begin treatment and relieve symptoms.\n\n**Treating Postpartum Depression**\n\nTreatment for postpartum depression is similar to treatment for clinical depression. Depending on your situation and the severity of your depression, you may be prescribed medication, therapy, or a combination of both.\n\n*   As of August 4, 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved Zuranolone as the first oral treatment for postpartum depression.\n*   Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are also commonly used medications for postpartum depression.\n*   Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) are psychotherapies known to relieve symptoms of postpartum depression.\n\n**How Common Is PPD in Men?**\n\nSupporting the results of the Verywell Mind and Parents survey, prior research has shown that about 8% of fathers experience paternal depression. Unfortunately, many cases of postnatal depression go undiagnosed in men, so early diagnosis and intervention are important for the health of the father and the family.\n\n*   Many factors can contribute to the development or worsening of postpartum depression.\n*   The effects of ignoring male postpartum depression narratives around the experience of postpartum depression often exclude men, even though fathers can and do experience the disorder.\n*   When male postpartum depression goes undiagnosed, it can harm the whole family.\n\n**Coping With PPD**\n\nWhen men suffer from postpartum depression, it can impact their ability to function and properly care for their partner and child. In addition to maintaining healthy self-care habits, which can include meditation or therapy, Tishman recommends:\n\n*   Exercising regularly\n*   Eating healthy foods\n*   Maintaining healthy sleep habits\n*   Talking about and expressing feelings\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMale postpartum depression can go undiagnosed for many months, but it is treatable. If you're a new father experiencing symptoms of depression, talk to your primary care physician or a mental health professional. If your loved one expresses concern over your mental health, then it's important to seek professional help so you can better care for yourself, your partner, and your new child. 1., The effects of paternal depression can be just as severe for children as they are for mothers.2., According to the World Health Organization (WHO), fathers with postpartum depression are at risk of experiencing major depressive disorder and substance misuse disorders in their lifetime.3., Depression is a treatable condition.4., If you or your partner are struggling with postpartum depression, it's time to seek professional help.5., 6., In some cases, the symptoms of paternal depression may not be as severe, but that doesn't mean they're any less important.7., Fathers can experience anxiety and feelings of guilt after the birth of a child, which can impact their mental health and relationships with their partners and children.8., A father's postpartum depression can have a significant impact on his child's development and increase the risk of psychiatric disorders in early childhood.9., The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that fathers be screened for postpartum depression as part of routine perinatal care.10 1., Men are just as susceptible to experiencing postpartum depression as women.2., In fact, research suggests that men who experience paternal depression may have a higher risk of developing major depressive disorder in the future.3., The effects of paternal depression on children can be significant and long-lasting.4.,", "category": "general"},

There are many ways to counter some of the symptoms of depression that don't involve prescription medications.\n\n*   If you have depression, you might like to try managing it naturally without medication or supplement your antidepressant with other options.\n*   This article discusses some natural treatments that may help fight depression including lifestyle changes and supplements.\n*   It also covers other strategies you might try such as practicing mindfulness or enhancing your home environment.\n\n**The Best Online Therapy Services for Depression**\n\nWe Tried and Tested\n\nSome research suggests that there are natural antidepressants that may help reduce symptoms of depression. For treating mild to moderate depression, dietary supplements such as St. John's Wort, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e), and 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) may be worth a try.\n\n*   Research has shown that St. John's wort is more effective than a placebo at relieving symptoms in those with mild-to-moderate depression.\n*   Omega-3 fatty acids have also been investigated for their potential impact on depression.\n*   While natural remedies can be good options for depression treatment, you should always consult your healthcare provider before taking them.\n\n**Tap Into Your Spirituality**\n\nReligion can be an impactful source of support for many people dealing with depression. But there is no need to join a church, synagogue, or mosque unless you wish to.\n\n*   Simple daily practices such as meditation or adding to a list of things you're grateful can help boost mood and overall well-being.\n*   Meditation can have a range of beneficial effects such as lowering stress levels and helping people to become more aware of their thoughts and reactions.\n*   There are many different types of meditation, but you can get started with a simple meditative exercise with these steps: Sit comfortably. Close your eyes. Breathe naturally. Focus on how your body feels while you breathe.\n\n**Get More Exercise**\n\nGetting more exercise doesn't have to mean training for a marathon, but it does mean putting in a half-hour or so of low-intensity activity each day, which has been found to be effective in improving mood and quality of life.\n\n*   Even better, take it outdoors. Fresh air and sunshine are especially healing for folks dealing with a special form of depression known as seasonal affective disorder (SAD).\n*   Lack of energy and low mood may mean that you simply feel too fatigued to get up and get active.\n*   Some things that you can try to stick to your habit: Enlist a friend. Ask a loved one to walk with you or do another form of exercise at least a few times a week.\n\n**Add Greenery to Your Home or Office**\n\nYou may also find it helpful to add indoor plants to your home or office environment. Natural settings are associated with improved mental well-being, so it makes sense that bringing the outdoors in might help improve your mood.\n\n*   Research has shown that adding indoor plants to your home or office can help in a variety of ways, including: Improving the workplace: Research has shown that office spaces enhanced with indoor plants improve worker concentration and workplace satisfaction.\n*   Reducing stress levels: Another study found that actively interacting with indoor plans by caring for them can reduce both physiological and psychological stress.\n\n**Tend to Your Social Life**\n\nWhen you're depressed, there's no reason to go it alone, and there are all sorts of reasons to reach out to friends and family. Make plans with loved ones and keep those dates. Join a club or sign up for a group activity such as a local dodgeball league or a French class.\n\n*   Other things you might try: Join a support group. Talking to other people who are going through similar experiences and challenges can be informative and helpful.\n*   Schedule activities. Having routines can be helpful when you are going through depression.\n\n**Have a Daily Routine**\n\nThe symptoms of depression can also make it difficult to stick to a schedule, but research suggests that having a routine can be critical for mental health.\n\n*   Maintaining a routine can also help you hold on to a sense of normalcy and stability when you are dealing with feelings of depression, stress, or anxiety.\n*   Not having a daily routine, on the other hand, can increase your feelings of stress and leave you feeling overwhelmed and unable to focus. So work on having a schedule that includes the basic things you need to get done as well as plenty of self-care.\n\n**Listen to Upbeat Music**\n\nThere's no doubt that music can have an impact on how you feel, so choosing the right music when you're feeling down might be an effective way of lifting your mood. Research has found people who are depressed may have a tendency to choose music that intensifies rumination, sadness, and emotion-focused coping.\n\n*   So while you might be tempted to turn to somber tearjerkers when you're feeling down, consider listening to more upbeat songs to boost your mood and inspire positive feelings.\n\n**Summary**\n\nDepression is a serious condition that may grow worse over time if left untreated. There are many ways to counter some of the symptoms of depression that don't involve prescription medications.\n\n*   If you have depression, you might like to try managing it naturally without medication or supplement your antidepressant with other options.\n*   This article discusses some natural treatments that may help fight depression including lifestyle changes and supplements.\n*   It also covers other strategies you might try such as practicing mindfulness or enhancing your home environment.\n\n**Get Help Now**\n\nWe've tried, tested, and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, Betterhelp, and Regain. Find out which option is the best for you.\n\nYou should talk to your doctor or therapist to find the best approach to treating your depression. Many lifestyle changes such as eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and getting enough sleep may help improve your symptoms.\n\nAlways talk to your healthcare provider before taking any supplements to treat depression, since these might have side effects of their own or may interfere with or interact with other medications you may be taking.

It was a picture-perfect day on the outside. The photo I posted on Instagram that day was perfect: my cute NYC card seen through a sparkling glass of champagne. I wasn't trying to hoodwink anyone except myself. If I posted the perfect picture, and had the perfect moments, maybe I would be happy. But despite that nice moment, I wasn't happy. And I couldn't fool myself.\n\nI felt empty inside, like my soul had left my body. That was the first time I realized I was depressed. And it set off a series of appointments, medications, treatments, hospitalizations, and battles to get me to where I am today. I had already been in therapy, but after that day, I took another step. I went on Wellbutrin, hoping it would crack through the shell of emptiness.\n\nWhen my psychiatrist wrote me that first prescription in 2015, I remember asking her if she thought I'd need to be on it for a long time. No, she said, I think maybe six months or so‚Äîjust to get you through this patch. It turned out to be just one step in a journey to treating my ongoing depression.\n\n**Facing the Reality of Depression**\n\nDepression is sneaky, until it's not. When my psychiatrist told me she thought I'd be on Wellbutrin for six months or so, I took it to heart. But several factors‚Äîboth controllable and not-made that unrealistic. Neither of us could have predicted that just four months after that conversation, my mom would be diagnosed with ovarian cancer.\n\nThat she would die less than two years later. I felt empty inside, like my soul had left my body. That was the first time I realized I was depressed. Or that inside of six months in 2017, I would also lose my job, have to give up my dog, and experience the breakup of a summer fling.\n\nA perfect storm for someone struggling with depression. We also didn't know at the time the depth of mental illness in my genetics, thanks to adoption. She didn't yet know the depth of how much I was drinking...because I didn't tell her. The combination of these risk factors really created the perfect storm, and, twice, I put myself in the eye of the storm by chasing several drinks with a handful of pills in an attempt to escape the pain.\n\n**The Struggle is Ongoing**\n\nAfter the second suicide attempt, I realized nothing changes if nothing changes, and I checked myself in for six weeks of inpatient treatment. Intellectually, I knew that six weeks of intensive therapy wouldn't cure me...but that doesn't mean I didn't hope that deep down.\n\nAlthough I was nervous about rejoining the real world, I also felt my stomach drop as we filled out depression relapse prevention sheets as part of our discharge plans. It was in that stomach drop that I realized that this is something I might be managing for a long time...or even the rest of my life.\n\n**The Struggle is Not Just About Me**\n\nIf My Parents Stayed in Hong Kong, I May Not Be Alive Today\n\nEverything You Need Is Inside You\n\nIt took a long time and a lot of pain to learn this one, but maybe the most transformative realization is that everything I need is inside me. I wrote the words everything I need is inside me over and over again in a notebook in my loopy cursive in treatment, willing them to imprint on my brain.\n\nI even thought about getting a tattoo, in hopes that literally imprinting the words on me would help them seep into my brain. But it took time and repetition‚Äîand sometimes I forget even today. My journey to that realization, though, was peppered with desperately looking for a magic bullet that would help me.\n\n**The Struggle is Not Just About Me**\n\nI looked ANYWHERE but inside for so long. Grasping for any straws, hoping that it was just an equation I had to solve, and that if I found the right variable, I would solve it! It would be fine!\n\nIt took a long time and a lot of pain to learn this one, but maybe the most transformative realization is that everything I need is inside me. But I'm a writer and therapist, not a mathematician, so this was a faulty equation.\n\nOh, the way I tried, though. I hopped on every wellness trend‚Äîfrom goat yoga, to healing crystals, to sound baths. I frantically texted everyone I knew, hoping they'd have some secret answer that would be a game-changer for me.\n\n**Self-Compassion is Key**\n\nDon't Be An A**hole to Yourself\n\nAs much as I just said that there's no magic bullet‚ÄîDr. Kristin Neff's self-compassion work has really stayed with me. If you're anything like me, the voice in your head is probably far more harsh to you than anyone else will ever be.\n\nA New Yorker at heart, I thought being nice to myself was something I didn't have time for. How would I ever get everything I wanted to get done without yelling at myself? Since losing my mom, all I've wanted is just for someone to tell me that 'it will all be OK, sweetie.'\n\nThe truth is that nobody else telling me that will ever carry as much weight as a mom telling you that, but the other truth is that I do have someone with me all the time who can tell me that‚Äîme. Our bodies respond to these internal self-attacks1 the same way they do to a verbal attack from someone else‚Äîor even how they respond to a physical attack.\n\n**Self-Compassion Makes Life More Manageable**\n\nYou Have to Be Honest-With Yourself and Others\n\nSeveral days before I left for inpatient treatment, one of my friends said to me, You know, you need to not try to outsmart this therapist. My face flushed with indignancy. She wasn't in the room with us! What did she know?!\n\nSo much, dear reader, so much. And as my therapist began to rip my soul bare, I saw what she meant. I had been so afraid to tell anyone about some of the emotions and actions I was most ashamed of.\n\nThe convenient thing about the self-medicating I was doing with alcohol and benzos is that you lose any self-awareness. I've blocked out much of 2018, when my depression was the worst, in part because it's too painful to remember how I felt, and in part, because I carry a lot of shame for how I acted when I had no idea how I was acting when I was desperately trying to escape my feelings.\n\n**Facing Feelings**\n\nWe have enough external stimuli attacking us in different ways‚Äîwhy also do that to ourselves? I was so scared to be myself. A person who had a range of BIG feelings‚Äîincluding the socially unacceptable ones. The ones a woman shouldn't have. Jealousy, anger, pettiness, etc.\n\nI've been writing about my mental health on the internet since my first", "category": "general"},

Other Underlying Health Issues\n*   Depression can be comorbid with certain physical conditions, such as heart disease, gastrointestinal problems, and hypertension.\n*   Treatment-resistant depression has been strongly associated with chronic non-cancer pain conditions.\n2. Mental health conditions\n*   Such as eating disorders, substance abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, and personality disorders\n3. Metabolic Abnormalities\n*   Clinical investigations have determined that nutritional deficiencies and metabolic disorders can play a role in treatment-resistant depression.\n4. Brain & Body Risk Factors\n\n**Family History & Genetics**\n\n*   It is well established that individuals with a family history of depression have a higher likelihood of developing clinical depression themselves over the course of their lifetime.\n*   Studies have made this connection for clinical depression as a whole, but there has not been much examination of the family history risk factors for treatment-resistant depression specifically.\n\n**Lifestyle Risk Factors**\n\nSome lifestyle factors can put you at risk for treatment-resistant depression. These include:\n\n1.  Misdiagnosis\n2.  Problems with medication:\n    *   Antidepressants can take up to six weeks to work.\n    *   Individuals often stop taking a drug too early, before the medication has time to take full effect.\n    *   Some people may also skip doses or stop medications prematurely due to unpleasant side effects.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nTreatment-resistant depression is not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).\n\n**Treatment**\n\nApproximately 20% to 40% of individuals with major depression do not exhibit an adequate clinical improvement with antidepressants.\n\n1.  How Your Doctor Determines If Treatment Has Failed:\n    *   The level of compliance with the current treatment regimen\n    *   The amount of time you took the medication\n    *   The dosage\n2.  Alternative treatments for treatment-resistant depression include vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and ketamine.\n\n**Coping With Treatment-Resistant Depression**\n\nDealing with treatment-resistant depression can be challenging. If you are dealing with treatment-resistant depression, here's what you can do to cope:\n\n*   Prioritize self-care.\n*   Manage your stress.\n*   Ditch drugs and alcohol.\n*   Adhere to your treatment plan.\n\n**Can Depression Go Away on Its Own?**\n\nRead More: CONDITIONS A-Z DEPRESSION CAUSES 15 Sources By Brina Patel Share Feedback  **References**\n\n1.

But what's the difference between feeling blue and having clinical depression? Depression is a mental health disorder characterized by episodes of persistent low mood. Most of the time, clinical depression refers to major depressive disorder. But there are other types of depression too, such as bipolar depression, seasonal affective disorder (SAD), formally diagnosed as major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern, and postpartum depression, now formally diagnosed as major depressive disorder with peripartum onset - to name a few. Read on to learn more about the symptoms, types, and causes of clinical depression, as well as treatments available to tackle this common but nefarious condition. Symptoms of Clinical Depression One of the well known symptoms of clinical depression is episodes of pervasive sadness. But you might not know that there are other significant symptoms of depression. In fact, there is a whole litany of symptoms that affect not just your mood but your sleep, your body, and how you think and behave. Mood Depression can change your mood in myriad ways. Along with sadness, you might experience a loss of interest in things that used to bring you pleasure-this is called anhedonia. Suddenly, your favorite TV show can't hold your attention, or you no longer get a boost of endorphins after your favorite running route. You might experience your life as flat. You might also feel hopeless, like nothing will ever improve, or you could feel overwhelmingly and inappropriately guilty about things that, ordinarily, would not warrant that level of guilt. In addition, you might experience a general sense of apathy-things don't matter to you like they used to, and it might feel hard to get motivated at work or to pursue your hobbies. Anxiety also often goes hand-in-hand with depression. The combination of persistent worry and rumination with symptoms like low mood, anhedonia, and hopelessness can be a match made in hell. Sleep Another key element of clinical depression is how it affects your sleep. You might find that you are oversleeping or not sleeping enough-both can be signs of depression. Specifically, early awakening is common in those with depression. You might find yourself consistently waking up in the wee hours of the morning and not being able to fall back asleep. Insomnia and restless sleep-the inability to fall asleep and waking up over and over throughout the night-can also be hallmarks of depression. Ironically, getting enough sleep, and enough restful sleep at that, is one key to managing depression, making these symptoms that much more insidious. Body Depression can affect your appetite, causing you to behave in uncharacteristic ways. You might suddenly feel ravenous all the time, as though your hunger can never be satiated no matter how much you eat; or you might lose your appetite completely. Associated with these are changes to your body-you might gain or lose a lot of weight unintentionally. Other physical symptoms might include fatigue or, on the other side of the coin, restlessness. Feeling overly tired or overly activated can also be signs of depression. Cognition and Behavior Depression can make it feel difficult or impossible to think. You might feel slow, like you're mentally wading through Jell-O, or like your brain is filled with cotton and you can't create or connect cogent thoughts. You also might have difficulty paying attention. These symptoms can make everyday tasks like work or school especially hard. You or your loved ones might also notice changes in your behavior due to depression. You might suddenly be easily irritated, or have frequent crying spells. You might often feel agitated, even when there's nothing to be agitated about. Friends and family might notice that you are isolating yourself so that you don't have to be social (which can feel particularly difficult when dealing with depression). Suicidal Ideation One of the most severe and challenging symptoms of depression is suicidality. If you're depressed, you might feel as though there is nothing worth living for. Or, it can even go beyond that, with an inexplicable but overwhelming urge to die. These feelings don't make sense to someone who is not experiencing them, and they can be the most difficult attributes of depression to talk about. You might feel ashamed or embarrassed for feeling suicidal, or you might feel as though you don't want to burden your loved ones with these feelings. It is important to recognize these suicidal thoughts as a treatable symptom of your depression and reach out for help immediately. If you or someone you care about is having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. 988 Types of Clinical Depression Clinical depression doesn't just refer to one singular condition. There are many different types of depression, associated with many different disorders. Major Depressive Disorder (Unipolar Depression) When someone says clinically depressed, major depressive disorder, or MDD, is usually what they mean. This is also known as unipolar (as opposed to bipolar ) depression. According to the DSM 5 (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), in order to be diagnosed with MDD, you must be experiencing at least five of the following criteria: Depressed mood Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all activities Significant and unintentional weight loss or weight gain Sleep disturbance (insomnia or hypersomnia) Observable agitation or retardation (noticeable by others) Fatigue, tiredness, or loss of energy Feeling worthless or feeling excessive or delusional guilt Impaired ability to concentrate, think, or make decisions Recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts In addition to these criteria, the following must also be true of your depressive symptoms: They cause significant distress and impairment in everyday life-professionally, socially, and or at home They're not better explained by medication side effects, drug use, or another medical condition You've never experienced a manic or hypomanic episode (which would indicate bipolar disorder rather than MDD) Your symptoms aren't better explained by schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder (such as schizoaffective disorder, which also involves mood symptoms) If you feel like you meet these requirements for MDD, talk to a psychiatrist or mental health professional about how you're feeling. Bipolar Depression Depressive episodes are also a significant part of bipolar disorder. In this condition, you experience mood swings, from depression to mania or hypomania. Bipolar depression meets the same criteria for depression as MDD, but a person must have experienced at least one manic or hypomanic episode-people with MDD do not experience mania or hypomania. Psychotic Depression Psychotic depression, also called depressive psychosis, or formally in the DSM major depressive disorder with psychotic features, is depression that is accompanied by psychotic symptoms. With psychotic depression, you might experience delusions (fixed false beliefs), hallucinations (false sensory perceptions), or disorganization where it can be difficult to think or communicate clearly. One key difference between psychotic depression and other psychotic disorders is that, in psychotic depression, the psychosis is only present during the depressive episode; in other conditions, like schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, you continue to have psychotic symptoms even when not in a depressive episode. Postpartum Depression Many people write off postpartum depression as the baby blues, but it is actually much more severe than that. Postpartum depression describes a clinical depressive episode that occurs after the birth of a baby. In the DSM-5, major depressive disorder with peripartum onset is actually defined as a major depressive episode occurring during pregnancy as well as in the four weeks following delivery. However, many clinicians extend that period to include the first year after birth. If left untreated, postpartum depression can negatively affect your the relationship with your newborn, interfering with bonding and potentially having significant long term impacts on the child. As with other types of depression, there can be an increased risk for suicide in the mother. If this describes you, reach out for professional help and support as soon as you can. Postpartum depression is a treatable clinical condition, and should be treated as such. Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) Premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or PMDD, is a very real depressive condition that is often dismissed as just part of your period -although it's anything but. Like MDD, PMDD has its own specific diagnostic criteria. In the week before your period, there must be at least one of these symptoms: Mood swings, crying spells, and emotional sensitivity Marked anger, irritability, or increased interpersonal conflict Depressed mood, hopelessness, or self-deprecating thoughts Increased anxiety, tension, or the feeling of being on edge Some of the following symptoms must also be present, to create a total of five when combined with the above criteria: Anhedonia or decreased interest in activities Difficulty concentrating Lethargy, easily fatigued, or lack of energy Changes in appetite, including overeating or specific cravings Insomnia or hypersomnia Feeling overwhelmed or out of control Physical symptoms like breast swelling or tenderness, muscle or joint pain, or bloating If this describes your period, you shouldn't have to suffer in silence. It's a real mood disorder and deserves real treatment. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) Seasonal affective disorder-appropriately shortened to SAD -is a major depressive condition that begins and ends with the changing seasons. People with SAD experience clinical depression (the symptoms of MDD) that correlate exclusively to seasonal shifts, with all symptoms persisting throughout one season and remitting completely when that season is over. (For most people, this occurs in winter, but it can be experienced in summer as well.) In order to be diagnosed with SAD, you need to have experienced major depressive symptoms during this season and only this season for at least two years, and over the course of a lifetime, you need to have had more seasonal depressive episodes than not. Essentially, a SAD diagnosis establishes a consistent pattern of seasonal depression. Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthemia) Persistent depressive disorder-previously known as dysthymia - is where, over the course of at least two years, someone will have a depressed mood most days or for most of the day. They'll also experience at least two of the following criteria: Insomnia or hypersomnia Poor appetite or overeating Feelings of hopelessness Fatigue or low energy levels Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions Low self-esteem Having persistent depressive disorder also means that you're not without depressive symptoms for more than two months out of the year- hence, persistent. A lot of the qualifiers for this disorder are the same as for MDD: for instance, it can't be better explained by a drug reaction or physical condition, there's never been mania or hypomania, there's no psychotic disorder, and it causes significant distress and disruption in everyday life. In addition, your symptoms can't be more accurately attributed to MDD or partially remitted MDD. Situational Depression Sometimes, dealing with a stressful or traumatic event can make us feel depressed; however, when this depression is specific to a certain situation and does not meet criteria for a mental health condition, it's not considered clinical depression. In fact, the technical term for situational depression is adjustment disorder with depressed mood. This describes marked distress or difficulty handling or coping with a stressful event that results in short-term depressive symptoms. If you have situational depression, you might feel overly sad, angry, or irritated; your sleep and appetite might be disrupted; carrying out daily tasks might feel difficult or impossible. But the key to situational depression is that these symptoms dissipate in time as you get further from the initiating event or its consequences. Atypical Depression Atypical depression, or major depressive disorder with atypical features, is a subtype of depression characterized by mood reactivity (your moods can change in the face of environmental circumstances) and the atypical features of increased sleep, increased appetite, leaden paralysis which is an extreme type of fatigue, and interpersonal rejection sensitivity. An atypical diagnosis can be applied to MDD, bipolar depression, and persistent depressive disorder. 7 Common Types of Depression Causes and Risk Factors Clinical depression doesn't stem from just one source or risk factor-it describes a wide variety of complicated conditions affected by many things, including genetics, your environment, and biology. Genetic Factors It's been found that certain genes have been linked to a higher prevalence of clinical depression, and if you have those genes, you're more likely to develop a depressive disorder. However, it's difficult to narrow down specific genes that cause depression because many people with mental illnesses are affected by many different genes ( polygenic sources) that contribute to their conditions.1 It has been proven, however, that depressive disorders are, in some instances, highly heritable-this means that having relatives who have depressive disorders means the likelihood of you having one increases.2 The emergence of depression can be influenced not just by your DNA, but by epigenetics, or how those genes get expressed. Adverse life events and environmental exposures have been shown to affect your epigenetics.1 Environmental Factors There are also elements of your environment that can make you more susceptible to mental illnesses like depression. Experiencing adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs, when you were young can increase your risk of depression-these things include child abuse or neglect and stressful life experiences like divorce or domestic violence. Your socioeconomic status can also affect your risk of depression. Being raised in a low-income household can have negative effects on your mental well-being as a child that can be carried with you to adulthood. In addition, being a victim of prejudice, bigotry, and racism can negatively affect your mental health, and make it more likely that you will at some point experience depression. Biological Factors While genetics are certainly a biological contribution to depression, there are many other factors that can play a role. In particular, physical co-occurring health conditions can greatly increase your chance of experiencing depression. Not only can chronic illnesses affect your physical health, their biological and emotional effects can increase your risk for depression. People who experience persistent or chronic stress are also more likely to develop depression. This is in some degree due to the dysregulation long term effects of stress has on the HPA system, or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis - the stress regulation system in the body. It's no wonder that stress on the body results in stress on the mind.3 Some Common Causes of Depression Co-Occurring Conditions People living with depression often have co-occurring mental health conditions. The most common of these is anxiety. This can be as the anxiety symptoms that often accompany depressive disorders, as well as co-occurring anxiety disorders, Many depressive and anxiety symptoms overlap-for instance, both conditions can be characterized by irritability, rumination, difficulty concentrating or making decisions, and trouble sleeping. But it is also not uncommon for those with anxiety disorders such as panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder or social phobia to also have a depressive disorder. It's also possible for people with different kinds of mental illnesses to experience depression as well. Someone with schizophrenia, a psychotic disorder, or a personality disorder like borderline personality disorder might also experience episodes of a major depressive disorder. Causes and Risk Factors of Depression Diagnosis of Clinical Depression Getting diagnosed with a form of clinical depression begins by getting an assessment by a mental health or medical professional, and can be quite straightforward. A psychiatrist, a psychologist, or a licensed clinical social worker can provide a diagnosis. Besides evaluating you for the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria we discussed earlier, there are other assessments that your provider can use to help with a diagnosis. There is no [formal] diagnostic assessment that is required to diagnose depression, but many exist that can help determine if symptoms are present, explains Amy Marschall, PsyD. Technically all that is needed is a diagnostic interview with a provider, and if that provider determines that there is enough information and evidence that symptoms are present, they can issue a diagnosis. However, she explains, they might use screening tools with cutoff scores, which can indicate whether symptoms are causing significant distress, or norm-referenced tools, which can provide information on how significant the symptoms are compared to the general population. Initial Assessment Two of the most common depression assessment tools are the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire). The BDI is a 21-question, multiple-choice quiz that relies on self-reporting of possible depressive symptoms. It evaluates the presence of certain symptoms and their severity based on your ratings from 0 to 3, with 0 signifying no presence of that symptom to 3 signifying the symptom at its worst. For example, the first question is about sadness, with answers ranging from I do not feel sad (0) to I am so sad and unhappy that I can't stand it (3). The BDI is meant for people ages 13 to 80, and requires a 6th-grade reading level in order to properly understand and fill out the questionnaire. The comprehensiveness of this inventory means it takes about 10 minutes to complete. The PHQ-9 is also a self-reporting measure designed to determine the presence and seriousness of depressive symptoms, but it is much shorter than the BDI (nine questions rather than 21-hence, the 9 in PHQ-9 ). The PHQ-9 also has you rate your symptoms from 0 to 3, but in terms of frequency rather than severity. For example, the first symptom you are asked to describe is little interest or pleasure in doing things, with answers ranging from Not at all (0) to Several days (1) to More than half the days (2) to Nearly every day (3). For both assessments, your score from each question is tallied and the range of your total score represents a certain level of depression. In the BDI, the lowest score means these ups and downs are considered normal and the highest score means extreme depression; in the PHQ-9, the lowest score means minimal depression and the highest score means severe depression. There are also specific depression assessments designed to measure depression both before and after treatment (the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), depression in children (such as the Children's Depression Inventory, based on the BDI), and depression in older adults (the Geriatric Depression Scale). Differential Diagnosis A differential diagnosis is the process of distinguishing your symptoms from the symptoms of other conditions when those symptoms overlap. For depression, a differential diagnosis would involve ruling out other psychiatric disorders, such as: Anxiety disorders Obsessive compulsive disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder Personality disorders Symptoms of physical conditions must also be ruled out, such as: Sleep disorders Parkinson's, MS, dementia, and other central nervous system disorders Drug use and misuse or side effects from medication Thyroid issues (hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism) Infectious diseases Treatment Options There are many ways to manage and treat clinical depression, including medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes. Medication Medications that treat depression are called antidepressants (although they are also commonly used to treat anxiety and other disorders as well), and there are many kinds that work on different mechanisms in the brain. The most common kinds are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), atypical antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). SSRIs are the most prescribed medications for depression. They allow for more serotonin to be passed from neuron to neuron in the brain. SSRIs include: Prozac (fluoxetine) Celexa (citalopram) Zoloft (sertraline) Lexapro (escitalopram) Paxil (paroxetine) SNRIs work similarly to SSRIs, but impact both serotonin and norepinephrine, and are commonly prescribed for depression as well as anxiety disorders. SNRIs include: Cymbalta (duloxetine) Effexor (venlafaxine) Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) Fetzima (levomilnacipran) TCAs also affect the reabsorption of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, as well as impacting other neurotransmitters. These were some of the first antidepressants and tend to come with more side-effects than the SSRI, SNRI and atypical antidepressants. Along with depression, TCAs can be used to treat insomnia, anxiety, and chronic pain. TCAs include: Amitriptyline Norpramin (desipramine) Tofranil (imipramine) Pamelor (nortriptyline) Amoxepin Doxepin Protriptyline Trimipramine Atypical antidepressants are called so because they do not function like these other types of antidepressants, and instead work differently on the neurotransmitter systems in the brain. Atypical antidepressants include: Wellbutrin (bupropion) Remeron (mirtazapine) Desyrel (trazodone) MAOIs were the first type of antidepressants ever developed, and can be quite effective, but currently are rarely prescribed as the newer kinds of antidepressants cause fewer side effects and are generally considered to be safer. Specifically, people taking MAOIs must follow a strict restrictive diet and avoid certain medications because of potentially serious interactions. MAOIs include: Emsam (selegiline) Nardil (phenelzine) Marplan (isocarboxazid) Parnate (tranylcypromine) It is important to bear in mind that, like any psychotropic medication, there are possible side effects when taking antidepressants. Common ones include: Agitation and anxiety Nausea and stomach pain Diarrhea or constipation Insomnia Headaches Loss of sex drive, inability to orgasm, or erectile dysfunction Loss of appetite Dizziness Weight gain Drowsiness Heart problems like palpitations or a fast heartbeat Most of these side effects dissipate over time, but if they persist or are unbearable, talk to your psychiatrist. You don't need to put up with side effects if they are making you miserable. Be aware that some rare side effects can be medically serious, such as: Serotonin syndrome (too much serotonin in the brain) usually caused when serotonin antidepressants are used with other agents that impact serotonin Hyponatraemia (low salt levels that can impact the brain) Increased risk of bleeding (particularly when used with anticoagulants) In addition, there has been a reported association with some antidepressants and increased suicidal ideation, especially in children, teenagers and young adults. If you are feeling suicidal, contact your doctor immediately. Psychotherapy Therapy is a great option for those living with clinical depression. There are a wide range of approaches and modalities that have been proven effective in the treatment of depression, so you're sure to find one that works for you. The most important aspect of treating depression with psychotherapy is finding the right therapist. Don't be afraid of trying out different providers until you find one you really click with. Common therapeutic approaches for treating depression include: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): Considered a gold standard in the treatment of depression, CBT teaches you to recognize and change maladaptive (harmful) thoughts, behaviors and coping strategies. It is important to recognize that, while you may not have the power to control what happens to you in life, you do have the power to control your reactions to what happens. Psychoanalysis: This modality focuses on experiences in your life, past and present, and your unconscious thoughts, habits, and motivations that may be contributing to your depression. Although formal psychoanalysis (several times a week on the couch) is less common nowadays, the principles involved (psychodynamic psychotherapy) are commonly employed in a variety of psychotherapeutic approaches and can be quite helpful in people better understanding themselves and growing in capacities that can mitigate depression. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT): A spin-off of CBT, ACT teaches you to accept your feelings, thoughts, and reactions to emotional triggers rather than avoiding them, trying to change them, or acting on them. This allows you to stop judging yourself for your depressive symptoms, and then focuses on using your values to guide your actions in your life. Dr. Marschall weighs in about the most common approach, CBT: Cognitive behavioral therapy has a lot of research behind it as an effective tool for treating depression, although this is partially because cognitive behavioral therapy is one of the easiest modalities to implement in a research setting, she explains. Basically, a therapist trained in CBT can help someone who is experiencing depression recognize how their thoughts and perception of the world around them might perpetuate depressive symptoms. For example, CBT techniques can help you catch negative self-talk reflecting harmful beliefs, like thinking, 'I am a failure,' after making a small mistake. Alternative and Complementary Therapies Although medication and psychotherapy are the mainstays of managing depression, there are a few complementary alternative approaches that have been proven to be helpful. Regular exercise has been proven to lessen depressive symptoms, for example.4 Yoga and mindfulness-based practices have also been shown to be helpful in managing depression,56 Each of these interventions can be used in conjunction with talk therapy and medication to supplement your depression treatment. In fact, they're recommended-but it's always best to seek out professional help as well. You might see acupuncture as a recommended alternative therapy for depression, but multiple studies have questioned its efficacy.7 In addition, St. John's Wort is sometimes recommended as an alternative to medication, but its effectiveness is not reliable; it also interferes with the efficacy of certain prescription medications, and can even result in serious health conditions (like serotonin syndrome) if taken alongside some kinds of antidepressants.2 Self-Care and Lifestyle Changes Everyone has different self-care needs, says Dr. Marschall, but an important starting point is ensuring that your basic physical needs are met. Depression is like carrying around an enormous invisible weight that makes every activity more difficult even if there is not a clear, visible reason why these challenges have arisen. Many people experiencing a depressive episode will struggle with eating, hygiene, and other basic tasks, explains Dr. Marschall. Not only can this be bad for your physical health, but it can create a vicious cycle. It's hard to come out of feeling depressed when you feel unclean from not showering for several days. When someone has very limited energy due to depression, I encourage them to keep things very basic. If you do not have the capacity for your full hygiene, for example, try to at least brush your teeth because dental care is tied to so many health issues, Dr. Marschall suggests. Can't do a whole two minutes? That is fine, just brush for 30 seconds, or use Listerine to protect yourself from other health consequences. There are also lifestyle changes that have been proven to help day-to-day symptoms. Incorporating exercise into your daily routine is an important and effective way to help you manage your depression. Not only does it produce immediate endorphins, boosting your current mood, but a healthier body supports a healthier mind in the long run. Starting a meditation or mindfulness practice can also help with mood symptoms. Taking the time each day to focus on what's going on inside of you can help you identify your current mood state and tackle challenges and symptoms head-on. Meditation can also help you calm your mind and think more carefully about what you need in order to feel your best that day. Bedtime routines are also helpful. Make sure you have good sleep hygiene: wind down before bed by weaning yourself off your screens and devices, and try to go to bed at the same time every night and wake up at the same time every morning. The most important aspect of self-care when dealing with depression, though, is not to judge yourself when you're experiencing symptoms. If you need to take a break at work, take a break; if you need a mental health day, respect that feeling and take the day off. The world isn't going to fall apart if you're out of commission for the day. Do things that normally boost your mood-go for a walk, watch your favorite TV show, go to the dog park and pet some dogs. Even if you can't feel better today, that's ok. You have the emotional flu-so treat yourself with the kindness you would if you had the actual flu. Can Depression Go Away on Its Own? Coping Strategies and Support There are lots of things you can do to cope with depression, both daily and in the long term. To begin, Dr. Marschall advises paying close attention to your emotional patterns. Noticing when you are starting to enter an episode is important. Since your brain's job is to give you information about the world around you, it does not always accurately cue you to what it is experiencing in the moment, she says. It's kind of like when my former employer's contact button broke on their website, and no one could find contact information to let them know that the link had broken. If you document what signs you experience at the start of an episode, you can get support before things get worse. Building a Support Network Make sure you have people around you whom you trust. This might be family members, friends, or coworkers-anyone you know you can talk to when you're feeling low. Being able to be honest with the people around you, especially loved ones, can keep you from feeling isolated in your depression. Suffering in silence doesn't help anyone. You might not feel as though the people around you will understand how you're feeling, and you might be right-they might not be able to completely understand. But chances are they'd like to. Chances are you have people in your life who want to be there to support you, through better or worse. Practice talking about your depression. Making it less scary to talk about your symptoms means more people will know what you're going through and can offer themselves as a source of support. Managing Daily Life Routines are very helpful for people with depression. Having stability and a plan for the day can help ensure that if and when depressive symptoms do arise, you can deal with them without having to worry about throwing off your entire life. Make sure you eat, even if you don't feel like it. Get some form of exercise, even if it's just going for a short walk. Talk to someone. If you're feeling bad and want to talk it through, do it. If you don't want to talk about how you're feeling, that's fine too. Send a stupid meme to your bestie. Remind yourself that you have people around you if you need them. If you're having a particularly hard day, it's ok to stay in bed for just that day. It's ok if the only exercise you get that day is moving from the bed to the couch. It's ok if the only thing you feel like eating is Cheetos. Be kind to yourself. However, if this becomes a pattern, it should be discussed with your mental health professional. My Partner and I Both Have Depression, Now What? Long-Term Management In the long run, it's especially important to maintain consistent treatment. Working with a therapist is a great way to manage your depression-don't get discouraged if the work you're doing in therapy is difficult or you feel like you're not making progress fast enough. Trust the system, trust your therapist, and trust yourself. (Though if you have been in therapy for a long time and are not noticing any changes or feeling supported in your therapy, it might be time for a consultation or to switch therapists.) If you and your providers have decided that you need medication in order to treat your depression, make sure you are taking it consistently the way it is prescribed. It might take you a few tries or combinations to get on the right medication-take note of how you are feeling day-to-day, and let your providers know if you start feeling worse. Don't feel like you have to settle for just feeling ok. Maintain interpersonal connections. Make sure you are talking to friends on a regular basis, even if it's just a text here and there to check in. Having a strong support system is imperative in living with and managing depression. My Personal Experiences with Depression I have been dealing with some form of clinical depression since I was in high school. At first, I was misdiagnosed with unipolar depression, then bipolar disorder; as it turns out, I have schizoaffective disorder, which is characterized by both mood symptoms (like depression and mania) and psychotic symptoms that persist even when one is not is a mood episode. I have been on upwards of 30 different medications over the past 20-ish years. My first experience with an antidepressant was in high school. I tried Celexa, and within two weeks I was experiencing suicidal ideation (sometimes antidepressants can have destabilizing effects, particularly in those with bipolar vulnerabilities). Next, in college, was Wellbutrin, which I was on for a few years until a psychotic break landed me in the hospital and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. After that, I was put on lithium, which is a go-to mood stabilizer for people with bipolar. Still, I was having regular depressive episodes that lasted months, some so bad that they catapulted me into suicidality. In my depressed states, it's difficult to think-it feels like I am on a permanent delay while the world rushes past me at twice its normal speed. To this day, that is how I experience my depressive episodes. There's also a deep sadness that descends over me that's not related to a situation or a problem; it's just there, like a weighted blanket I do not want or need, pushing me down. There have been times when I physically could not move, I was so depressed. I've laid on my bed or on the couch, immobile with pain. There have been times I haven't eaten for days, weeks where I couldn't sleep or slept far too much. I feel my depression in my chest-a gaping hole where my ribcage should be. Although my mood symptoms are now, finally, under control, I still occasionally get depressed, even severely depressed. The episodes tend to end more quickly, and I haven't felt suicidal in a very long time-all wins in my book. But I recognize that depression will most likely be a major part of my life for the rest of my life. I also recognize that my depression doesn't have to define me, or keep me from living the way I want to. 6 Things People Get Wrong About Depression, From a Therapist Conclusion There are many different types of clinical depression-major depressive disorder, bipolar depression, and postpartum depression, to name a few-and a myriad of ways to treat them. Talk therapy can help you deal with your depressive symptoms as they arise, and antidepressant and other medications can make your depression more manageable or even disappear. Lifestyle changes can also help with depression-for example, regular exercise and a stable support system are invaluable when dealing with depressive symptoms. If you are feeling depressed, you don't need to suffer in silence. If you are already in therapy, talk to your therapist about how you are feeling; if you already have a psychiatrist, explain to them what you are experiencing. If you need to find a provider to help treat your depression, online therapy is an accessible and affordable option. Look for a company that specializes in treating depression. Online therapy companies and online therapy directories can connect you with mental healthcare providers who can treat depression and might even take your insurance, making their services that much more feasible. If you are feeling suicidal or in crisis, there are emergency resources for you: 988: The Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. Dial or text 988 to be connected to emergency mental health services. However, bear in mind that, if you are determined to be a danger to yourself or others, the police might get involved as first responders. The Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741 to be connected anonymously to a crisis text line volunteer. Depression doesn't have to be your end-all, be-all. Don't be afraid to reach out for help if you are depressed.

Avoid substances: Refrain from quick fixes and substances like alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, or other drugs.\n5.  Maintain a healthy routine: Work on maintaining a consistent and balanced daily routine, with a reasonable work and personal schedule, adequate sleep, and a nutritious diet.", "category": "general"},

Wire Mother Experiment\n2. Hugs Reduce Stress\n3. Hugs From Strangers vs. Loved Ones\n4. Hugs Increase Well-Being\n5. Hugs and Personal Conflict\n6. Hugs Boost Immune Response\n7. Give Yourself a Hug\n8. Keep in Mind\n\nIf you ever find yourself thinking, \"I want a hug,\" there are good reasons why.\n\nHugging has a relaxing and soothing effect on people.\n\nHugs are actually good for your health and science shows why hugs and touch are therapeutic.\n\n**At a Glance**\n\nIn his famous and controversial experiments, psychologists Harry Harlow revealed just how important physical contact is for mental wellness.\n\nHugs not only reduce stress, they also help increase happiness, boost immunity, reduce conflict, and improve overall well-being.\n\n**Research on the Psychology of Hugs**\n\nPsychologist Harry Harlow designed a study in which he took rhesus monkeys from their biological mothers.\n\nHe then offered two choices to the young monkeys:\n\n1. One choice was a terrycloth surrogate mother who gave no food.\n2. The other choice was a wire mother who provided food.\n\nInterestingly, the infant monkeys spent more time with the soft cloth mother even though she didn't provide sustenance.\n\nThe baby monkeys who fed at the wire mothers ate but then quickly returned to hold onto the cloth mother.\n\nScientists concluded that there is more to mother-child interactions than merely providing food.\n\nWhen you feel a need to be hugged, you want that same contact comfort.\n\nIt's the same type of comfort the monkeys in Harlow's experiment craved.\n\nIt's the same sort of comfort that infants want from their caregivers.\n\nIt's physically and emotionally crucial for an infant's psychological development.\n\nAs adults, getting that hug or tactile stimulation from someone we care about gives us a sense of closeness and well-being.\n\n**What Is Haphephobia?**\n\nHugs Reduce Stress and Increase Happiness\n\nNot everyone likes to be hugged or touched in the same way.\n\nBut generally, positive physical contact can effectively reduce your stress level and boost your mood.\n\nFeelings of loneliness and experiencing chronic stress can ultimately be harmful.\n\nHugs lower cortisol, which is sometimes called the stress hormone, in your body.\n\nHugs even lower blood pressure and heart rate.2\n\nAt the same time, a wonderful hug from a family member or friend will also bolster neurotransmitters such as dopamine in your system.\n\nDopamine is sometimes called the happiness hormone.\n\nHugs are one form of positive physical contact.\n\nOther forms include:\n\n*   Holding hands\n*   Being stroked\n*   Snuggling\n*   Getting therapeutic massages\n*   Nurturing touch during the early years helps our younger selves regulate emotions.\n\nWith high levels of loving hugs and physical contact, babies and toddlers develop in a healthy manner.\n\n**Hugs From Strangers and Loved Ones**\n\nCould hugs from a stranger even have positive benefits?\n\nIn a study published in a recent issue of Comprehensive Psychoneuroendocrinology, self-soothing touch and being hugged showed positive results even when strangers hugged.\n\nHugs reduced cortisol responses to stress and had calming effects.3\n\nHugs and touch acted as a type of social signal for safety.\n\nThey reduced fear and stress and gave participants a sense that all was well.\n\nScientists consider self-soothing touches and hugs to be potentially powerful ways to cushion an individual from stress and build resilience.\n\nBeing touched by a romantic partner would likely be even more pleasant than a hug from a stranger.\n\nBecause of the shared history, emotional closeness, and sexual intimacy a couple has together, a quick hug in the kitchen before one of you leaves for work could mean even more than a hug from someone you don't know well or at all.4\n\n**Physical Touch as a Love Language: What it Means**\n\nHugs Increase Well-Being\n\nBeing hugged uplifts our mood.\n\nIf you are feeling isolated or are going through a rough time, a hug releases endorphins.3\n\nEndorphins are the body's natural pain relievers.\n\nThese neurotransmitters increase our feelings of pleasure.\n\nThe release of endorphins is commonly associated with the after-effects of vigorous exercise.\n\nBut endorphins kick in through a variety of ways.\n\nThey are the happiness boosters that move us away from pain to pleasure.\n\nWhile it seems to be just a simple, loving gesture from a loved one, hugging also increases our level of oxytocin, the cuddle hormone. Oxytocin helps us bond with others and reduces the stress hormone, norepinephrine.5\n\nWhile hugging a family member or partner when we get home may seem like a small thing, healthy touch is like the glue that connects us.\n\nIt underpins our physical, psychological, and emotional well-being.\n\nHugs actually enhance our relationships and bonding with others.\n\n**Hugs and Personal Conflict**\n\nOur bonding with others is sometimes subject to conflict.\n\nHugs even help us during interpersonal conflict.\n\nIn a recent study, scientists interviewed 404 adults every night for 14 consecutive days specifically about their conflicts, hug receipt, and positive and negative affect. 6\n\nThe study's results aligned with its hypothesis that hugs buffer against harmful changes in our emotions when we experience interpersonal conflict.\n\nSurprisingly, the effects lasted even through the next day.\n\nA hug on a day of conflict with someone makes us feel good.\n\nBut the mere act of hugging actually improved the next day negative affect (i.e., your emotions).\n\n**Hugs Boost Immune Response**\n\nCan being hugged and hugging others affect our susceptibility to infectious disease?\n\nYes, according to scientists.\n\nBecause hugs lower our stress, they seem to carry a feeling of social support. In this recent study regarding upper respiratory infection, researchers examined the roles of perceived social support and received hugs in protecting us from stress-induced susceptibility to infectious disease.7\n\nResearchers exposed participants to a virus that causes a common cold.\n\nThey then monitored participants in quarantine to assess for signs of infection and illness.\n\nThey found that among infected participants, greater perceived support and more-frequent hugs each predicted less-severe illness signs.\n\n**Can You Give Yourself a Hug?**\n\nIf your partner or spouse is working in another city or your family and friends are scattered, you can't always get the physical contact you desire right now.\n\nYou might choose to hug yourself.\n\nYou can thereby give yourself that feeling of being secure and loved.\n\nIf your goal is to reduce the sense of touch hunger, hugging, self-stroking and massaging are excellent activities to accomplish that. Here are 6 suggested ways to self-soothe:\n\n1. Tell yourself positive things and give yourself a warm, strong hug.\n2. Place your hand over your heart and gently massage your heart.\n3. Softly massage your temples.\n4. Crisscross your arms and stroke the upper arms gently up and down.\n5. Put your hands on your shoulders and rock side to side.\n6.

You are more likely to experience symptoms of depression if others in your family also have depression or another type of mood disorder.\n\n*   Estimates suggest that depression is approximately 40% determined by genetics.\n*   Studies show that having a parent and grandparent with depression doubles the risk of having the condition.\n*   It is still unclear exactly which genes play a role in depression, but researchers do know that there are many different genes that can play a role.\n\n**Brain and Body Causes of Depression**\n\nSome causes of depression are related to the brain and body. These can raise your risk for depression.\n\n*   Brain chemistry imbalances\n*   Physical health and certain medical conditions\n\n**Lifestyle Causes of Depression**\n\nThere are also a number of lifestyle factors that can play a role in causing depression.\n\n*   Circadian rhythm disturbances\n*   Poor nutrition\n*   Stress\n*   Substance use\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDepression is a complex condition that can affect anyone at almost any age.

The theory was developed by sociologist Reuben Hill in 1949.\n\n**Why Is Family Stress Theory Important?**\n\nWithin every family is a family system, which includes members' roles, beliefs, rules, values, expectations, boundaries, and responses to their environment.\n\n*   Parents are expected to fulfill caretaking roles, while children rely on them for safety, survival, and support.\n*   Differing values, roles, beliefs, rules, expectations, boundaries, and responses to environmental factors directly impact what causes, exacerbates, or alleviates stress in different family systems.\n\n**How Family Therapy Works**\n\nFamily therapy can help resolve challenges by ensuring each member feels safe and heard.\n\n**Coping With Family Stress**\n\nTo decrease stress within the family system, consider:\n\n1.  Implementing family meetings with shared agreements.\n2.  Scheduling alone time for each family member.\n3.  Creating a zen corner for meditation.\n4.  Asking for help through support groups, therapy, or relationships.\n\n**The Benefits of Family Stress Theory**\n\nUnderstanding this theory offers the opportunity to make more empowered decisions regarding stress.\n\n*   Resources can be pivotal in the outcome of a crisis.\n*   Internal resources include stress and anger management skills, conflict resolution skills, communication skills, self-regulation, mindfulness, and self-awareness.\n*   External resources include financial support, access to food and medical care, social and communal support, physical or practical assistance, and emotional and psychological support.\n\n**How to Cultivate Resources During Stressful Times**\n\nCultivating internal and external resources can help families navigate stressful times.\n\n*   Identify and develop coping skills for stress management.\n*   Explore community resources for assistance.\n*   Practice mindfulness, self-care, and self-compassion. 14 Benefits of Mindfulness Meditation What Are the Top Stressors in Life?

Health issues or chronic illnesses\n4.  Relationship conflicts or divorce\n5.  Moving to a new home or location\n\nEach of these factors can impact family dynamics, causing stress that can be exacerbated without support and limited resources.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFamily stress theory offers insights into the changes within a family dynamic due to stressful events. Understanding this theory allows families to make more empowered decisions regarding stress, develop coping skills, and cultivate internal and external resources for better outcomes. By implementing strategies like family meetings, scheduling alone time, creating a zen corner, and asking for help, families can navigate stressful times with greater resilience. 17 Benefits of Being an Empathetic Person Table of Contents Why Is Family Stress Theory Important? How to Cultivate Resources During Stressful Times Coping With Family Stress The family stress theory explores the changes within a family dynamic that occur as a result of a stressful event. The theory was developed by sociologist Reuben Hill in 1949. He was particularly interested in how families were impacted by World War II and looked into how war-induced separations and reunifications shifted families. Noticing that the separations and reunions were crises within the family system, he spotted some patterns. He noted how the family's internal and external resources can buffer or exacerbate the stressful event, influencing how the family interprets and makes meaning of the inciting event. All three of these factors combined - the event, available family resources, and the family perception of the event - interact to influence and determine the outcome of the crisis.1 What Are the 5 Top Stressors in Life? Why Is Family Stress Theory Important? Within every family is a family system. This system includes the family members and their roles, beliefs, rules, values, expectations, boundaries, and responses to their environment. Parents are expected to fulfill the role of caregivers, and their children rely upon them for safety, survival, and support. In one family system, parents may fulfill all of the caretaking roles for a child like cooking, cleaning, and getting them ready for school. In another family system, the oldest child may be expected to adopt some caregiving responsibilities, like being assigned the role of watching and caring for their younger siblings when their parents are out of the house working. This is a different role for the child, which impacts the family system. Additionally, a family may have values based on occupational or educational standards. For example, it may be taboo in some families to not attend college, while other families may expect all members to work in a family business or to go to a trade school. Differing values, roles, beliefs, rules, expectations, boundaries, and responses to environmental factors directly impact what causes, exacerbates, and alleviates stress in different family systems.1 What Happens in a Family Unit When an Issue Arises? When a stressful issue arises in a family, the response will range depending on coping, stress management, and parenting skills. A parent may scream and accuse, blame and shame, approach with curiosity and patience, or any number of responses which is heavily dependent upon their internal and external resources:2 Internal resources: Stress and anger management skills, conflict resolution skills, communication skills, the ability to self-regulate, mindfulness, and self-awareness External resources: Financial resources, access to food and medical care, social and communal support, physical or practical assistance, and emotional and psychological support including therapy Understanding this theory offers the opportunity to make more empowered decisions regarding stress. How Family Therapy Works How to Cultivate Resources During Stressful Times Family stress theory states that resources can be pivotal in the outcome of the crisis. However, certain resources are outside a family's control. For example, a family's financial situation or access to meet our basic needs cannot always be controlled. In these situations, you can look at internal resources you can cultivate and external resources you can access.2 Example Scenario No. 1: A Parent Loses Their Job Let's say you are a parent who is a primary provider for your family who loses your job. This will thrust your family into varying levels of crisis depending on your needs, savings, environment, and support system. If you do not have much in savings and are applying for every job you can with no luck, this can cause significant stress that can be exacerbated without support and limited external and internal resources. You notice that you have less emotional availability when parenting and that your children's behavior begins to shift as your temper shortens, mood changes, and own struggles and stress begin to affect the rest of your family. This would be an example of a time to connect with your external resources and reach out for social and community support. Calling upon a family or community member to help with childcare could be instrumental in providing your children care while allowing you the space and time you need to focus on finding a job. This may be challenging for those with limited friendships and community connections, intensifying stress and hardship. Another option for developing and tapping into external resources is exploring community resources. For example, there might be a job", "category": "general"},

Block, MD The information on this page is current as of April 2023 and may not reflect the most up-to-date developments or research in psychology. What's This? **Understanding the APA Code of Ethics**\n\nThe American Psychological Association (APA) publishes the Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct which outlines aspirational principles as well as enforceable standards that psychologists should use when making decisions.\n\n*   In 1948, APA president Nicholas Hobbs said, [The APA Code of Ethics] should be of palpable aid to the ethical psychologist in making daily decisions.\n*   The APA Code of Ethics is meant to provide a common set of rules that help ensure mutual safety and patient benefit.\n\n**APA Code of Ethics' 5 Principles**\n\nNot all ethical issues are clear-cut, but the APA offers psychologists guiding principles to help them make sound ethical choices within their profession. The APA Code of Ethics' Five Principles\n\n1.  **Beneficence and Non-Maleficence**: Psychologists should strive to protect the rights and welfare of those with whom they work professionally.\n2.  **Fidelity and Responsibility**: Psychologists have a moral responsibility to help ensure that others working in their profession also uphold high ethical standards.\n3.  **Integrity**: In research and practice, psychologists should never attempt to deceive or misrepresent.\n4.  **Justice**: Mental health professionals have a responsibility to be fair and impartial.\n5.  **Respect for People's Rights and Dignity**: Psychologists should respect the right to dignity, privacy, and confidentiality of those they work with professionally.\n\n**The APA Code of Ethics' Standards**\n\nThe 10 standards found in the APA ethics code are enforceable rules of conduct for psychologists working in clinical practice and academia. The 10 Standards Found in the APA Code of Ethics\n\n1.  **Resolving Ethical Issues**: This standard provides information about what psychologists should do to resolve ethical situations they may encounter in their work.\n2.  **Competence**: Psychologists must practice within their areas of expertise.\n3.  **Human Relations**: Psychologists frequently work with a team of other mental health professionals.\n4.  **Privacy and Confidentiality**: This standard outlines psychologists' responsibilities in maintaining patient confidentiality.\n5.  **Advertising and Other Public Statements**: Psychologists who advertise their services must ensure that they accurately depict their training, experience, and expertise.\n6.  **Record Keeping and Fees**: Maintaining accurate records is an important part of a psychologist's work.\n7.  **Education and Training**: This standard focuses on expectations for behavior when psychologists are teaching or training students.\n8.  **Research and Publication**: This standard focuses on ethical considerations when conducting research and publishing results.\n9.  **Assessment**: Psychologists should obtain informed consent before administering assessments.\n10. **Therapy**: This standard outlines professional expectations within the context of providing therapy.\n\n**What Happens When a Therapist Violates the APA Code of Ethics?**\n\nAfter a report of unethical conduct is received, the APA may censure or reprimand the psychologist, or the individual may have their APA membership revoked. Complaints may be referred to others, including state professional licensing boards. State psychological associations, professional groups, licensing boards, and government agencies may also choose to impose penalties against the psychologist.\n\n**Reporting a Therapist for Unethical Behavior**\n\nIf you would like to file a complaint against a therapist, contact your state's psychologist licensing board.\n\n*   The most significant ethical issues include:\n    *   **Client Welfare**: Given the roles they serve, psychologists often work with individuals who are vulnerable due to their age, disability, intellectual ability, and other concerns.\n    *   **Informed Consent**: Psychologists are responsible for providing a wide range of services in their roles as therapists, researchers, educators, and consultants.\n    *   **Confidentiality**: Therapy requires providing a safe place for clients to discuss highly personal issues without fear of having this information shared with others or made public.\n    *   **Competence**: The training, education, and experience of psychologists is also an important ethical concern. Psychologists must possess the skill and knowledge to properly provide the services that clients need.\n\n**The Big Picture**\n\nAlthough the APA Code of Ethics provides respected principles and enforceable standards for professional conduct, psychology is not free from ethical controversy. For example, debates over psychologists' participation in torture and the use of animals in psychological research remain hot-button ethical concerns. Nevertheless, reputable psychologists commonly turn to the APA Code of Ethics for help with moral and ethical issues and decisions commonly faced in their profession.

Ethics are an important concern in psychology, particularly regarding therapy and research. Working with patients and conducting psychological research can pose various ethical and moral issues that must be addressed. Understanding the APA Code of Ethics The American Psychological Association (APA) publishes the Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct1 which outlines aspirational principles as well as enforceable standards that psychologists should use when making decisions. In 1948, APA president Nicholas Hobbs said, [The APA Code of Ethics] should be of palpable aid to the ethical psychologist in making daily decisions.2 In other words, the APA Code of Ethics is meant to provide a common set of rules that help ensure mutual safety and patient benefit. When Did the APA Publish Its Code of Ethics? The APA first published its ethics code in 1953 and has been continuously evolving the code ever since. What's in the APA's Code of Ethics? The APA Code of Ethics comprises two key elements: Principles: the underlying ethical foundation on which psychologists should base their practices and decisions, whether they work in mental health, research, or business.

In general, counseling is recommended for specific issues and situations, such as addiction or grief, and takes place over weeks to several months. Psychotherapy, in contrast, tends to explore past issues that might be contributing to present day problems. It often takes place continually or intermittently over a period of years. In actual practice, however, there is a great deal of overlap between the two types of therapies. Understanding some more of the differences between counseling and psychotherapy may be helpful in choosing the type of therapy that will be most effective for you as an individual. Get Help Now We've tried, tested, and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, BetterHelp, and ReGain. Find out which option is the best for you. Counseling vs. Psychotherapy While the same therapist may provide both counseling and psychotherapy, psychotherapy generally requires more skill than simple counseling.1Ôªø It is conducted by professionals trained to practice psychotherapy such as a psychiatrist or psychologist, a trained counselor, or a social worker. While a psychotherapist is qualified to provide counseling, a counselor may or may not possess the necessary training and skills to provide psychotherapy. That said, a therapist may provide counseling with specific situations and a counselor may function in a psychotherapeutic manner. Counseling Technically speaking, counselor means advisor. It involves two people working together to solve a problem. It is a term that is used in conjunction with many types of advice giving. For example, financial planning and spiritual guidance are both types of counseling. Just about anyone may claim to be a counselor if they are in the role of giving advice. The term counseling may also properly be used to refer to what occurs in a relationship with a psychotherapist. In the context of mental health, counseling is generally used to denote a relatively brief treatment that is focused primarily on behavior. It often targets a particular symptom or problematic situation and offers suggestions and advice for dealing with it. In this setting, the counselor offers guidance and support as the individual figures out ways to better manage life and adjust to change or adversity. There are many types of counselors, such as marriage and family therapists, grief counselors, addiction and substance abuse counselors, and more. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy on the other hand is generally a longer-term treatment that focuses more on gaining insight into chronic physical and emotional problems. Its focus is on the person's thought processes, and how these may be influenced by past events such that they cause problems in the present. In other words, psychotherapy addresses the root cause and core issues of current problems so that lasting change and personal growth may occur. There are several different types of therapy that fall under the general heading of psychotherapy, including approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, psychoanalytic psychotherapy, and much more. The Best Online CBT Services, According to a Therapist Similarities There are many similarities between counseling and psychotherapy, and even with the distinction, counseling often includes some psychotherapy and psychotherapy often includes some counseling. Similarities include: Development of a healing, safe, and therapeutic relationship between a therapist and an individual Effectiveness for a wide range of people, both adults and children Understanding a person's feelings and behaviors, and addressing issues with the goal of improving a person's life Differences While mental health professionals with more advanced degrees (eg. psychology PhD or PsyD) are more likely to provide psychotherapy, the same provider may do both types of therapy. There are some key differences between the providers, however. Counseling Focus on present problems and situations Specific situations or behaviors Short term therapy (for a period of weeks and up to 6 months) Action and behavior focused Talk therapy Guidance, support, and education to help people identify and find their own solutions to current problems Secondary process Psychotherapy Focus on chronic or recurrent problems Overall patterns, big picture oriented Long term therapy, either continuous or intermittent over many years Feeling and experience focused May include testing (such as personality, intelligence), talk therapy, other therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy In-depth focus on internal thoughts feelings (core issues) leading to personal growth Primary process How to Choose Between a Counselor and Psychotherapist When choosing a therapist, it's helpful to learn about the differences noted above, as well as the background of specific providers and the approaches they use. Sometimes the choice will come down to personal preferences, access, or insurance coverage. The most important step, however, is to find a therapist you can trust. In fact, the level of trust a person has in their mental health care practitioner plays the greatest role in whether the therapy will be successful or not. You may actually need to talk with a provider or visit for a few appointments before you know which type of therapy is best for you. For example, with some situations it can be difficult to know if it is a short term, a limited problem you are facing (and thus, may fall under conditions best treated with counseling), or if instead there are events or situations in your past that are leading to the current problem. When You May Wish to See a Counselor Counseling may be a better option than psychotherapy if: 1. You have specific issues or short term problems you wish to address. 2. You wish to learn coping skills to help better manage stress and improve relationships. 3. You are coping with life transitions and adjustments, such as divorce or grief. 4. You are coping with addiction issues. 5. You are looking for someone who is essentially a coach who can guide and support you as you learn to recognize problems and formulate healthy solutions yourself. When You May Wish to See a Psychotherapist A psychotherapist may be a better option if: 1. You have problems that are significantly impacting your life and relationships. 2. You are coping with past trauma, or if you believe situations in the past may be playing a role in your current issues. 3. Your present issues are chronic or recurring concerns. 4. You have a chronic medical condition (such as autoimmune disease, cancer, etc.) that is affecting your emotional well-being. 5. You have a diagnosed mental health condition such bipolar disorder or a major anxiety disorder. How to Find a Therapist Counseling vs. Psychotherapy for Depression Both counseling and psychotherapy are used in the treatment of depression, and the choice can depend on the severity of the depression, whether it is a new issue for you or rather an ongoing or recurrent problem and more. As far as the effectiveness of the two approaches, a 2016 study found that counseling was just as effective for the treatment of previously untreated mild to moderate depression diagnosed in primary care.2Ôªø Another 2016 study, however, found that interpersonal psychotherapy was somewhat more beneficial than counseling in adolescents with depression, with respect to both symptoms, and overall functioning over the short-term.3Ôªø That said, a 2018 study looking at the same group found that long term, the effects of counseling were more beneficial.4Ôªø People with chronic, severe depression might benefit most from psychotherapy", "category": "general"},

{"title": "I Needed A Therapist That Could See Me After Work-So I Tried E-Therapy Cafe", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/e-therapy-cafe-online-therapy-review-tried-and-tested-in-2023-8710289", "content": "on This Article\n\n**Title**\nI Needed A Therapist That Could See Me After Work-So I Tried E-Therapy Cafe\n\n**Overview**\n\nGetting set up with traditional therapy is very hard.\n\n*   In the past, it has taken me two months to hear back from a therapist about their availability to see me.\n*   Only for me to realize that I couldn't afford the cost (even with health insurance) and I'd have to take time off work to attend the sessions, which was just too complicated and not sustainable.\n\n**The Solution**\n\nSo I started considering online therapy as a way to find more accessible, affordable, and flexible therapy and I found E-Therapy Cafe, a boutique online therapy company that stands out from its (sometimes better-known) competition for its accessibility, affordability, and flexible session times.\n\n**Signing Up for E-Therapy Cafe**\n\nThe website looks a little clunky and busy when you first land on it. There's tons of text on squeezed in on every page-often in different fonts, which can be distracting-and at first glance, the site might even come off as unprofessional. However, it's fairly simple to navigate once you get the hang of it.\n\n*   Halfway down the homepage is a button that says, Take the First Step Now, which takes you to an intake form to fill out on the site.\n*   The initial intake form is rather detailed and includes both multiple choice and short answer responses for questions such as gender, relationship status, current feelings and stress levels, and an open area to discuss what you'd like to get from therapy.\n*   There is also an option on the initial intake form to choose the provider you prefer, rather than being matched with one.\n\n**My Experience**\n\nI got an email from the E-Therapy Cafe Client Portal less than 24 hours after submitting my intake form that included several long-form questions about my past as well as how I cope with things currently. In this email, I also got more information on what I needed in order to participate in E-Therapy Cafe sessions, which was just internet connection, video capability, and a back up video app that could be used in case the link to my therapy session I was sent doesn't work for some reason.\n\n**The Providers**\n\nE-Therapy Cafe employs a small team of 13 providers who are all licensed clinical therapists and expert-level certified life coaches. It's important to note that, while licensed therapists are held to legal licensure standards, coaches-even certified coaches-are not held accountable in this way.\n\n1.  E-Therapy Cafe addresses this issue by only employing coaches who are also licensed therapists, so you know that no matter who you see, they are a licensed professional.\n2.  Each therapist has an extensive bio that includes their areas of expertise, approach, and facts about them, as well as their license state and numbers.\n\n**Cost**\n\nThere are both pay-as-you-go and subscription options at E-Therapy Cafe. Per-session prices are $65 per half-hour session, though you can get a slight discount on your first session (which is considered a Trial) and pay $55.\n\n1.  There are two subscription options:\n    *   ETC Flex (The Monthly Wellness Pack), which is eight online sessions within a month and costs $470 per month ($58.75 per session)\n    *   ETC 90 (The Quarterly Commitment), which is a 90-day pack of 24 sessions and costs $440 per month ($55 per session)\n2.  Additionally, E-Therapy Cafe offers an Emotional Support Animal (ESA) visit for $170, which includes the session, assessment, evaluation, consultation, and prescription if you qualify.\n3.  It also offers an ETC Reflect (Between Session Support) option, which is a digital journal or email chat session with a provider for $65 per 700 words.\n\n**My Therapy Sessions**\n\nAfter scheduling, I got an appointment email reminder that included the link to go to for the session. I was pleased that I able to schedule an appointment approximately 24 hours after I initially signed up for these services-a much quicker turnaround time than with other online therapy companies, and certainly than with most in-person practices.\n\n1.  There are three different ways you can communicate with your therapist (i.e. use a session):\n    *   30-minute video calls\n    *   30-minute instant e-chat sessions\n    *   E-journal entries, which is where you write up to 700 words on how you're feeling or what you're struggling with and get a thoughtful response from your provider within 48 hours.\n2.  The first methods you have to schedule appointment times for. I had a hard time figuring out the e-journal method and never actually got around to doing it as a result, so I opted for the video calls, and it was a good experience.\n\n**Pros and Cons**\n\nI really appreciated and enjoyed my experience with E-Therapy Cafe. It was certainly the most positive therapy experience I've had in my life so far. All that said, the company has its good and bad.\n\n1.  Pros:\n    *   Much more availability than traditional therapy\n    *   Relatively affordable compared to traditional therapy and other companies\n    *   Clinicians with a wide range of expertise\n    *   Detailed provider bio information available\n    *   Ability to choose a preferred provider\n2.  Cons:\n    *   Insurance is not accepted\n    *   No app, so you must use the website\n    *   Sometimes information, such as how to do an e-journal, is difficult to find\n    *   Website is a little clunky and overwhelming\n    *   Therapy services limited to states in which providers are licensed\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nThe best thing about E-Therapy Cafe, in my opinion, is its accessibility. Not only do its providers have availability to see you at nontraditional times, I was also able to pay less than what I would for traditional therapy with my insurance, and I didn't have to miss work or wait for weeks and weeks to hear back.\n\n1.  My provider was also pretty well matched up to what I needed, even though at first I had concerns.\n2.  He was very helpful, and my experience was mostly very positive.\n3.  Most of the negative aspects I noticed had to do with the navigation of the website.\n4.  I think with an app and possibly fixing a few bugs there would be fewer negative aspects to mention.\n\n**E-Therapy Cafe User Survey**\n\nMy positive experience seems to align with other people's experience too. We surveyed 100 current and previous E-Therapy users, and 85% rated E-Therapy as very good or excellent. Ninety-five percent of users stated they were either likely or very likely to recommend the company to others, and 96% were able to find a therapist who met most or all of their needs.\n\n1.  Eighty-eight percent rated their therapist's qualifications as very good or excellent, and 90% would start their search at E-Therapy Cafe again if they needed a new therapist.\n2.  Overall, the quality of the care at E-Therapy Cafe was top notch and I'd personally recommend it to others,", "category": "general"},

Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Pub. ISBN 9780890425558\n\n**What is Addiction?**\n\nAddiction is a disorder characterized by the compulsive use of a substance or activity that triggers our reward systems despite experiencing adverse consequences.\n\n*   A person's genes and environment influence this complex condition.\n*   Addiction is widely viewed as a brain disease due to how it impacts the brain's reward, pleasure, and self-control circuits.\n\n**Understanding Addiction**\n\nA person engages in potentially addictive activities to feel pleasure, and over time, the reinforcing effect of these activities may change brain chemistry to create an unconscious drive to continue the behavior.\n\n*   Multiple factors influence this process, including genetics, diet, mental health, past traumas, pain, stress, and stage of life.\n*   The first step in overcoming addiction is to desire change and avoid the people, places, and things that promote the addiction.\n\n**Breaking an Addiction**\n\nSupport groups, mentors, 12-step programs provide help, while counselors, recovery centers, and physicians provide expertise and medication to treat cravings and the effects of withdrawal.\n\n*   Eating healthy and getting exercise also play an important role in recovery.\n*   A person's genetics account for about half of their risk for developing an addiction.\n\n**Is Addiction Genetic?**\n\nThe impact of genetics is influenced by an interaction between a person's environment, diet, and biology. Alcoholism, like other addictions, tends to run in families, and members of those families are at increased risk for developing alcoholism.\n\n*   A substance use disorder diagnosis can be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe depending on the number of diagnostic symptoms or criteria a person exhibits.\n*   Behavioral addiction occurs when a pleasurable activity changes the brain and drives a person to engage compulsively in the activity despite harmful consequences.\n\n**KEY TERMS**\n\n*   Substance Use Disorder: A psychiatric condition that involves the compulsion to use a drug or alcohol despite the development of adverse consequences.\n*   Behavioral Addiction: A disorder characterized by compulsive engagement in an activity despite experiencing adverse consequences.\n*   Intervention: An organized attempt by family members or friends to confront a loved one about how their addictive behavior has affected them.\n*   Comorbidity: The presence of more than one distinct condition in an individual.\n\n**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**\n\n1.  Is addiction a disease?\n2.  What causes addiction?\n3.  How can you break an addiction?\n4.

Mental Disorders: Definition, Prevalence, Causes, Diagnosis, Treatment, Coping Strategies, And More What Are Mental Disorders? A mental disorder is often used interchangeably with the terms psychological disorder, psychiatric disorder, or mental illness. The official term is mental disorder.\n\n**What are mental disorders?**\n\nMental disorders are defined as conditions that create distress and affect a person's ability to function. These conditions affect how people behave, think, and feel. They can also impact how people are able to function at home, at work, in school, in relationships, and in other important life domains.\n\n**Symptoms of Mental Disorders**\n\nSome of the symptoms that a person with a mental disorder might experience include:\n\n*   Anxiety\n*   Changes in appetite\n*   Changes in behavior\n*   Changes in mood\n*   Delusions, hallucinations, or other difficulties perceiving reality\n*   Depression or feelings of sadness\n*   Difficulty sleeping\n*   Drug or alcohol use\n*   Fatigue or low energy\n*   Irritability\n*   Loss of interest\n*   Social withdrawal or isolation\n*   Trouble concentrating\n*   Suicidal thoughts or self-harm\n\n**How Are Mental Disorders Diagnosed?**\n\nThe classification and diagnosis of mental disorders are important concerns for both mental health providers and mental health clients. While there is no single, definitive definition of mental disorders, some different classifications and diagnostic criteria have emerged.\n\nClinicians utilize the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association, to determine whether a set of symptoms or behaviors meets the criteria for diagnosis as a mental disorder. The International Classification of Diseases, published by the World Health Organization, is also frequently used.\n\n**Treatment for Mental Disorders**\n\nThe specific treatment for a mental disorder varies depending on the condition and the needs of the individual. Many mental health conditions are treated with psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of the two. Lifestyles changes and support groups can often be helpful as well.\n\n**Coping With a Mental Disorder**\n\nIn addition to getting professional treatment for a mental health condition, there are other strategies that can be helpful for finding relief. Lifestyle changes: For some mental health conditions, lifestyle changes can be helpful. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM): Other practices that may help people cope with symptoms of mental illness include CAM treatments.\n\n**Recap**\n\nMental disorders can create distress and make it difficult to function as you normally do. If you suspect you have a mental disorder, talk to a health care professional to learn more. With an appropriate diagnosis, you can better understand your symptoms and find the treatment you need so that you can find relief and improve your ability to function in your daily life.\n\n**References**\n\n1.

The Key Concepts of Behaviorism in Psychology How rewards, punishments, and associations shape behavior 1 This article was originally published on Verywell Mind. It has been reviewed and updated for this edition. By Kendra Cherry, MSEd Updated on January 27, 2025 Reviewed by David Susman, PhD Table of Contents History Types Classical Conditioning Operant Conditioning Uses Impact Criticisms Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**The Key Concepts of Behaviorism in Psychology**\n\nBehaviorism is a school of thought that explains behavior as the result of environmental factors rather than internal thoughts or feelings. There are two types of behaviorism: methodological and radical. The former emphasizes the study of observable behavior, while the latter focuses on understanding behavior through reinforcement and punishment.\n\n**History**\n\nBehaviorism was formally established in 1913 with John B. Watson's paper \"Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It.\" Watson argued that all behaviors are the result of experience and can be trained through conditioning. He believed that any person could be trained to become a specific type or specialist, regardless of their background or talents.\n\n**Types**\n\nThere are two main types of behaviorism:\n\n*   **Methodological Behaviorism**: This approach emphasizes the study of observable behavior and excludes internal mental states.\n*   **Radical Behaviorism**: This approach focuses on understanding behavior through reinforcement and punishment.\n\n**Classical Conditioning**\n\nClassical conditioning is a technique used in behavioral training. It involves pairing a neutral stimulus with a naturally occurring stimulus, eventually leading to the association of the neutral stimulus with the response. The process works by developing an association between an environmental stimulus and a naturally occurring stimulus.\n\n**Operant Conditioning**\n\nOperant conditioning is a method of learning that occurs through reinforcement and punishment. Through operant conditioning, an association is made between a behavior and its consequences. This approach states that when a desirable result follows an action, the behavior is more likely to occur again in the future.\n\n**Uses for Behaviorism**\n\nBehaviorism has various applications, including education, research, and mental health. Its techniques can be used to help students learn, conduct research, and treat mental health conditions.\n\n**Impact of Behaviorism**\n\nBehaviorism has had a significant impact on our understanding of human psychology. The conditioning process alone has been used to understand many different types of behaviors, ranging from how people learn to how language develops.\n\n**Criticisms of Behaviorism**\n\nSome critics argue that behaviorism is a one-dimensional approach to understanding human behavior, neglecting internal influences such as moods, thoughts, and feelings. Others suggest that behavioral theories do not account for free will or the role of genetics in determining behavior.\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n*   Who founded behaviorism? John B. Watson.\n*   How is behaviorism used in education? Behaviorism can be used to help elicit positive behaviors or responses in students through reinforcement.\n*   What makes behaviorism different from psychoanalysis? Behaviorism focuses on environmental stimuli, while psychoanalysis emphasizes internal stimuli and the unconscious mind.", "category": "general"},

Last medically reviewed on January 12, 2024 Medically reviewed by Steven Gans, MD Laura Porter Updated on May 26, 2018\n\n**Types**\n\nThere are different types of color therapy that include:\n\n1.\nRed: It is used to energize or invigorate a person who might be feeling tired or down. However, red may also trigger people who might already be tense.\n\n2.\nBlue: Chromatherapists use blue to try and influence depression and pain. Darker shades of blue are also thought to have sedative properties and may be tried for people who experience insomnia or other sleeping disorders.\n\n3.\nGreen: Green is the color of nature, and according to chromatherapists, it can help relieve stress and relax a person.\n\n4.\nYellow: Yellow can be used to improve your mood and make you more happy and optimistic.\n\n5.\nOrange: Orange, much like yellow, can be used to elicit happy emotions from people. The bright warm color is also thought to be able to stimulate appetite and mental activity.\n\n6.\nThe Color Blue: Meaning and Color Psychology\n\n**Techniques of Color Therapy**\n\nThere are two major techniques of color therapy:\n\n1.\nColor therapists believe that color can enter our bodies either through our eyes or skin. Each color we can see has its wavelength and unique frequency. Each unique frequency has a different effect on people and is used for different purposes.\n\n2.\nWarm colors are typically used for stimulating effects, while cool colors are used for calming effects.\n\n**Uses**\n\nChromotherapy is considered a type of alternative medicine treatment that has been purported to help with:\n\n*   Stress\n*   Depression\n*   Aggression\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Sleep disorders\n*   Anxiety\n*   Certain cancers\n*   Skin infections\n\n**Benefits**\n\nOver the decades, color therapy has been purported to provide several benefits ranging from physical to mental, including:\n\n*   Stress relief: Certain colors like blue and green are thought to have soothing effects on people who are stressed or anxious.\n*   Boost your appetite: Warm and stimulating colors are thought to boost your appetite when you struggle with having a desire for food.\n*   Seasonal affective disorder: People mainly suffer from seasonal affective disorder during colder weather because of the lack of sunlight. Certain types of bright light therapy have been shown to be of benefit for this mood disorder. Color therapy also suggests the unproven idea that warm colors like yellow and orange could also help with this.\n*   To boost your energy: Colors such as red and yellow are believed to boost your energy and make you more motivated.\n\n**Things to Consider**\n\nWhile the premise of color therapy is that certain colors elicit specific emotions from most people, this isn't always the case. Human beings are unique. The effects of certain colors on people may range from person to person. Colors most people might find calming or soothing might be anxiety-inducing or depressing to others.\n\n**How to Get Started**\n\nWhile the science behind color therapy is still largely unsubstantiated, it's completely harmless to practice certain aspects of color therapy on your own. Here are some ways you can get started with experimenting with color therapy:\n\n*   Get rid of blue lights at nighttime for better sleep.\n*   Bask in nature. The greens of leaves and grass we get in abundance in nature can positively relax us.\n*   Be intentional about color choices. When picking colors for anything, from the color of the walls in your room to the color of clothes you wear, choose colors that you find stimulating or elicit positive emotions.\n\nIt's important to reiterate that color therapy doesn't serve as a definitive treatment for any mental or physical health conditions. If you are experiencing a condition such as depression, it's important to speak to your doctor about it. 3 Sources By Toketemu Ohwovoriole Toketemu has been multimedia storyteller for the last four years.

Maybe we can start over and figure out what's going on here. \n\nI'm not sure if I agree with all of the points made in this text. Some of them seem pretty obvious, while others are more nuanced. Can we break down each section and discuss its pros and cons?\n\nLet's take a closer look at the **Dating Tips and Strategies** section:\n\n*   Be open-minded and willing to try new things.\n*   Take risks and step out of your comfort zone.\n*   Communicate effectively with your partner.\n*   Respect boundaries and consent.\n*   Practice self-care and prioritize your own emotional well-being.\n*   Learn from past experiences and use them as opportunities for growth.\n\nWhat are some potential benefits of following these tips?

Are there any scenarios in which they might not be applicable?\n\nNow that we've discussed the **Dating Tips and Strategies** section, let's move on to the **Relationships in the Digital Age** section:\n\n*   Take a break from technology and focus on building meaningful connections.\n*   Be authentic and genuine in your online interactions.\n*   Prioritize quality over quantity when it comes to relationships.\n*   Don't be afraid to say no or set boundaries with potential partners.\n\nWhat are some potential benefits of following these tips? How might they improve one's dating experience?\n\nOn the other hand, what are some potential drawbacks or limitations of these tips? Are there any scenarios in which they might not be applicable?\n\nI'm starting to see a pattern here. Each section seems to emphasize the importance of being open-minded, taking risks, communicating effectively, and practicing self-care. But are these tips really that effective?\n\nWhat do you think? Should we keep going through each section and discussing its pros and cons, or is there something more we should be focusing on?\n\nThe text mentions several articles and resources that might be helpful for navigating the world of love and relationships. Have you read any of them? Do they offer any insights or advice that might be relevant to our discussion?\n\nI'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed by all this information. Can we try to summarize the main points and see if there's a clearer takeaway message?\n\nLet's focus on the **Conclusion** section:\n\n*   Dating can be challenging, but it's also an opportunity for growth and self-discovery.\n*   Be patient and kind to yourself.\n*   Focus on building meaningful connections rather than trying", "category": "general"},

{"title": "How Behavioral Therapy Works", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-behavioral-therapy-2795998", "content": "on Article\n\n**How Behavioral Therapy Works**\n\nBehavioral therapy is an action-based approach that focuses on changing maladaptive behaviors by reinforcing desirable ones and eliminating unwanted ones.\n\n**Types of Behavioral Therapy**\n\n1.  Applied behavior analysis (ABA) uses operant conditioning to shape and modify problematic behaviors.\n2.  Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) adds a cognitive element, focusing on the thoughts behind behaviors.\n3.  Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) combines CBT with mindfulness techniques to manage emotions and improve relationships.\n4.  Exposure therapy helps people overcome phobias by gradually exposing them to feared situations or objects.\n5.  Rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) focuses on identifying and challenging negative thoughts.\n\n**Behavioral Therapy Techniques**\n\n1.  Classical conditioning involves forming associations between stimuli, such as pairing an undesirable behavior with an aversive stimulus.\n2.  Operant conditioning uses reinforcement and punishment to increase or decrease the frequency of a behavior.\n3.  Contingency management uses contracts to outline behavior-change goals and rewards.\n4.  Extinction removes reinforcement to eliminate unwanted behavior.\n5.  Behavior modeling involves learning through observation and imitation.\n\n**What Behavioral Therapy Can Help With**\n\n1.  Anxiety disorders\n2.  Bipolar disorder\n3.  Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n4.  Autism spectrum disorders\n5.  Borderline personality disorder (BPD)\n6.  Depression\n7.  Eating disorders\n8.  Panic disorder\n9.  Phobias\n10. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)\n\n**Benefits of Behavioral Therapy**\n\n1.  Effective in treating a range of conditions, including anxiety and depression.\n2.  Can be more affordable than other forms of therapy.\n3.  Results are often seen in five to 20 sessions.\n4.  Can help with communication, coping strategies, and self-esteem.\n\n**Effectiveness of Behavioral Therapy**\n\n1.  Approximately 67% of people who try psychotherapy experience some positive improvement.\n2.  CBT is effective for treating anxiety disorders, including PTSD and OCD.\n3.  However, its effectiveness can vary depending on the condition being treated.\n\n**Things to Consider**\n\n1.  Behavioral therapy may not be enough for complex mental health conditions.\n2.  It may not address underlying problems or situations contributing to a mental health issue.\n3.  It is essential to find a qualified behavioral therapist and participate actively in treatment.\n\n**How to Get Started**\n\n1.  Find a behavioral therapist, such as a counselor, psychologist, psychiatrist, or social worker.\n2.  Ask for recommendations from your primary care physician or insurance provider.\n3.  Set clear goals with your therapist to create an effective treatment plan.\n4.  Be committed to participating in the process and working towards change.", "category": "general"},

{"title": "Should Your Child Be In Therapy?", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/should-your-child-be-in-therapy-5221707", "content": "on This Article Was this article helpful? Yes No\n\n**What Does Therapy for Children Look Like?**\n\nChildren's brains are different from adult brains. Between ages six and 12, children are still developing the ability to think about concrete operations (such as adding and subtracting). It isn't until adolescence, or ages 12 to 18, that kids and teens are able to do more complex thinking such as considering abstract concepts, reasoning new ideas from known principles, and considering many points of view.1 The adult brain isn't fully developed until 25 years old.2\n\nThe fact that children's brains are so different from adult brains means the way that children experience emotion, process their experiences, and communicate their needs will be different than how adults do these things.\n\n**Play Therapy for Young Children**\n\nYounger kids especially often process emotion through play, and play therapists utilize games and toys in their sessions to facilitate this. It can look to parents like their child is just playing in their sessions, when in fact the therapist is creating space for this important emotional work to occur.3\n\nChildren often feel safer opening up emotionally when they are engaged in play. In addition, children often act out real-life scenarios through play, which provides a lot of information to the therapist about what the child is coping with.\n\n**Talk Therapy**\n\nTeenagers might engage in talk therapy but spend much of their session discussing things that the parent might not think is relevant to their presenting issues. What your teen feels is important to cover in therapy might not perfectly line up with your perception. Since rapport is a key element of therapeutic change, discussions that do not seem to relate to your teen's symptoms are still an important part of their treatment.5\n\nEven though the parent or legal guardian has to sign off in order for the child to participate in therapy, this does not mean that you will have access to all of the information from your child's sessions. While you will have access to their medical records, the Privacy Rule under HIPAA states that, with a few exceptions, parents don't always have rights to receive a mental health professional's notes that are taken during sessions with their child.6\n\n**Mandated Reporting**\n\nYou, your child, and the therapist should discuss limits to confidentiality early in treatment to ensure that everyone understands and is on the same page about privacy in sessions.\n\nShould your child disclose something that makes the therapist concerned for their safety, the therapist will have to follow your state's applicable mandated reporting laws. The therapist might let you know that they had to contact Child Protective Services about a disclosure, but if they are concerned that this disclosure would put your child at risk, they might not share this information with you.8\n\n**Signs Your Child Might Benefit from Therapy**\n\nThere is no minimum threshold for someone to need or deserve support. If your child states that they think they need therapy, take their concerns seriously. However, the following signs might indicate that they may benefit from mental health treatment:\n\n1. There has been significant change in their mood. If your child has become withdrawn, fearful, or moody, this might indicate that they are having a hard time and could benefit from talking to a therapist.\n2. Their behavior has changed. Has your child started getting into trouble at school, or have their grades shifted suddenly? This can be a red flag that they are struggling. Instead of punishing them for a change in behavior, help them explore what the cause might be.\n3. They have experienced a stressful or traumatic event. Trauma is relative, and different things impact people differently. If your child has experienced something stressful or traumatic, they may benefit from processing with a professional. Examples of traumatic events include childhood abuse, experiencing or witnessing domestic violence, bullying, and the death of a loved one.\n4. They have engaged in self-harm behavior. A person might engage in non-suicidal self-injury when their mental health is suffering. A therapist can help your child identify the underlying causes of this behavior and help them find more appropriate coping skills.\n5. They have expressed suicidal ideation. Though it can be distressing to think about, even children as young as four to six can experience suicidal thoughts and behaviors.9\n\n**Finding A Therapist For Your Child**\n\nIt can be difficult to find a therapist who specializes in your presenting concerns, has availability, is a good fit, and accepts your health insurance. When finding a therapist for your child, the following things are important to keep in mind:\n\n1. What are your child's specific concerns? Therapists can specialize in different areas, so look for someone whose expertise includes your child's needs.\n2. Who does your child want to see? It can be tempting to choose a therapist based on your preferences, but remember that they are there to treat your child. The child's preferences and needs should take priority in choosing a therapist.\n3. Can your child develop good rapport with this therapist? You might have to try more than one therapist before your child meets one with whom they feel safe and comfortable.\n\n**Do You Need Therapy, Too?**\n\nAlthough they do not always show it, children are very in tune with the emotions of the adults around them. Often, a child will engage in acting out behaviors in response to things they have experienced or even unspoken feelings they pick up on from their parents. Stressors that impact your child's mental health may likely be affecting you as well.\n\nMany mental health issues have a genetic component, and so if your child meets criteria for a diagnosis, it is possible that you are predisposed to something similar.10 Furthermore, parenting a child who is dealing with mental health issues can be stressful, and you deserve support for your own stress.\n\nBecause mental health stigma is pervasive, many adults are hesitant to seek therapy for their own issues. It is OK to get support and attend your own therapy. This can not only help you get the care that you need and deserve, but it normalizes getting mental health treatment. You can model for your child that it is OK to ask for help, and struggling with their mental health does not make them bad.\n\nGetting your own therapy can help you change how you approach parenting and how you interact with your child, breaking maladaptive or unhealthy patterns. If appropriate, you and your child can attend family therapy together to work on your relationship.

Sometimes, the best and most supportive thing you can do is seek support for your child or yourself.

You may have heard about a therapist from a friend or family member who had great experiences with them. However, it's essential to remember that the same therapist who worked well for your friend might not be the best fit for you.\n\n### **Why Finding the Right Therapist Matters**\n\nA good therapeutic relationship can make all the difference in therapy. Research has shown that the quality of the relationship between a patient and their therapist is more important than the type of treatment used.1\n\n### **What to Consider When Choosing a Therapist**\n\nWhen looking for a therapist, consider factors such as:\n\n*   Gender: Do you feel more comfortable with a man, woman, or nonbinary person?\n*   Age: Do you want to work with someone older, younger, or around your age?\n*   Religion: Does it matter if the therapist has a particular religious affiliation?\n\n### **Where to Find a Therapist**\n\nYou can start your search by:\n\n*   Checking with your health insurance provider for a directory of therapists who accept your insurance\n*   Asking friends and family members for recommendations\n*   Reaching out to mental health organizations or online directories\n\n### **What to Ask a Therapist Before You Meet**\n\nDuring a consultation, consider asking questions such as:\n\n*   How do you conduct therapy sessions?\n*   What types of treatments do you use?\n*   How will we work together to achieve your goals?\n\n### **What to Expect During Your First Appointment**\n\nYour first appointment may involve discussing your problems or symptoms, setting goals for treatment, and answering questions about your childhood, medical history, and past mental health treatment.\n\n### **Changing Therapists**\n\nIf you don't feel a connection with your therapist or if you're not seeing progress towards your goals, it's okay to change therapists. You can talk to your current therapist about your concerns or ask for a referral to someone else.\n\nIn conclusion, finding the right therapist is crucial for effective therapy. By considering factors such as gender, age, and religion, searching in reputable directories, asking questions during consultations, and being open to changing therapists if needed, you can find a therapist who is a good fit for you.\n\n---\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

And, based on our interview with her, we quickly noticed Dr. Joy's warm and welcoming presence, and it became easy to see why she's so extraordinary at what she does.\n\n**Why Dr. Joy Became a Therapist**\n\nDr. Joy learned that therapy was what she wanted to do because she liked knowing that she could make a difference in someone's life. Therapy Was a Calling\n\n1.  I had an opportunity to take a psychology class in high school ... and I fell in love with the subject matter and knew I wanted to major in that once I got to college, starts Dr. Joy.\n\n**The Therapy for Black Girls Directory Connects Black People to Black Therapists**\n\nTherapeutic rapport is a significant factor in determining the success of treatment. In other words, the relationship that someone has with their therapist can make all the difference. And, for people of color, finding a therapist who not only understands their mental health needs but also understands how their culture plays a role in how they perceive mental health can be difficult.\n\n*   According to the American Psychological Association, 83% of mental health professionals are White and the remaining 17% are of color.\n*   Dr. Joy sheds light on the value of Black clients seeing therapists of color.\n\n**Aims to Repair Broken Hearts**\n\nDr. Joy's practice focuses on providing relationship therapy. I work with clients very relationally, there's a lot of things that you don't know about yourself until you're in a relationship with someone, says Dr. Joy.\n\n*   Considering her experience helping college students deal with their relationships, she felt that going on to specialize in relationship therapy felt like a natural transition.\n*   Black and interracial friendships can be a safe space for mental health.\n\n**Using Pop Culture to Help People Heal**\n\nDr. Joy (whose Twitter tagline is You can find me at the intersection of psychology and pop culture ) is known for referencing trending movies and series to jumpstart conversations about relationship issues.\n\n*   In her podcast, for instance, Dr. Joy has covered everything from Issa's painful breakup with Lawrence as a result of her infidelity in HBO's Insecure and Carlton and Will's complex dynamic in Peacock's Bel-Air.\n*   People may cheat for different reasons.\n*   And many of us may say that we have a love-hate relationship with at least one (or all) of our family members.\n\n**Moving Away From 'The Superwoman Schema'**\n\nA far-too-frequent role that Black women willingly and reluctantly take on is that of the superwoman. It's a good thing for us to recognize that we've been running ourselves into the ground and not really taking good care of ourselves in the interest of taking care of so many other people.\n\n*   Dr. Cheryl Woods-Giscombe was the first to put a name to this concept-the Superwoman Schema (SWS).\n*   Black women are taught to be resilient, self-sacrificial, and independent.\n*   Taking care of their own needs and mental health is typically last on their to-do lists-if it even appears on the list at all.\n\n**What's Next for Dr. Joy?**\n\nConsidering Dr. Joy's support for group healing, she's written a book about how sisterhood can help Black women heal from trauma and heartbreak. Her debut book, Sisterhood Heals: The Transformative Power of Healing in Community, will be released on June 27, 2023.\n\n*   Dr. Joy is helping Black women heal from heartbreak and trauma.\n*   Read More: THERAPY\n\n**Fun Facts About Dr. Joy**\n\nWhat does Dr. Joy do for self-care?: Aside from taking a lot of naps, Dr. Joy loves to hula hoop.\n\nDoes Dr. Joy see a therapist?: Absolutely, every Tuesday at 2:15!\n\nThe piece of mental advice Dr. Joy wishes she learned sooner: Recognizing how much sleep impacts her mental health\n\nHer hope for the Black community: I'd like to see more group therapy and that's a personal aim of mine.\n\nOn how it feels to be recognized for her work: We have made an incredible impact [with the] work that we do at Therapy for Black Girls. So, it always feels nice to have other people recognize that. Recognition like this allows more people to find out about it, which is the best part. I'm very excited about it.

The American Psychological Association notes that most therapists in the United States are White, with only 17% being people of color.\n2. Dr. Joy believes that having a shared cultural experience can help build trust between clients and their therapists, especially for Black women who may feel more comfortable discussing sensitive topics with someone who understands their perspective.\n3. The Superwoman Schema (SWS) is a concept developed by Dr. Cheryl Woods-Giscombe to describe the numerous roles Black women are expected to take on, including wife, mother, nurturer, and breadwinner.\n4. Dr. Joy acknowledges that while it's essential for Black women to prioritize their self-care needs, cutting off everyone and focusing solely on oneself can be unhealthy and may not be sustainable in the long term.\n5. Dr. Joy hopes to see more group therapy in the Black community, as she believes it can provide a safe space for people to support one another and work through challenges together.\n\nThis article provides an overview of Dr. Joy Harden Bradford's background, her journey to becoming a therapist, and her work with Therapy for Black Girls. It also highlights her commitment to helping Black women build healthy relationships and heal from heartbreak and trauma. The article mentions Dr. Joy's use of pop culture references to facilitate discussions about relationship issues and her efforts to promote group therapy as a means of supporting the mental health needs of Black people.\n\nSome of the key points mentioned in the article include:\n\n*   Dr. Joy's passion for helping Black women heal from heartbreak and trauma\n*   Her use of pop culture references to facilitate discussions about relationship issues\n*   The importance of cultural safety in mental healthcare, particularly for Black clients\n*   The Superwoman Schema (SWS) concept developed by Dr. Cheryl Woods-Giscombe\n*   Dr. Joy's hope for more group therapy in the Black community\n\nOverall, this article provides a comprehensive overview of Dr. Joy Harden Bradford's work and her commitment to promoting mental health and wellness among Black women.

It takes courage to be willing to share your deepest feelings with a mental health professional. In therapy, it is completely normal to experience fears of judgment or hesitation to share intimate details of your life.\n\nIn turn, you may feel uneasy at the thought of telling your therapist everything or may wonder how much information is too much information. This article will explain if you should tell your therapist everything and why.\n\n**Reasons Why You Can't Open Up**\n\nYou might be hesitant to open up to your therapist because:\n\n*   Shame: Feeling shame can lead to withdrawing from therapy psychologically and even physically.\n*   Reluctance: It's normal to feel hesitation when sharing details about your life with someone that you don't know that well.\n*   Embarrassment: Maybe you overreacted to something in your personal life and you feel embarrassed to share that with your therapist.\n*   Anger: Maybe you are upset about something your therapist said and want to tell them how you feel.\n*   Fear: It's also possible that you're scared to share things about your life.\n\n**Confidentiality**\n\nWhile therapists are required to keep your personal matters confidential, it is important to remember that there are times when your therapist must break confidentiality for legal and ethical reasons and tell a third party about content shared in your session.\n\nA therapist will break confidentiality only under emergency circumstances:\n\n1.  You have an intent to harm yourself or others.\n2.  You share information about current child abuse, elder abuse, or abuse of disabled people.\n3.  Your therapist receives a court order (this occurs in instances where the patient is involved in a legal case and their mental health needs to be evaluated).\n\n**What to Do If You Don't Trust Your Therapist**\n\nFeeling distrust in the therapeutic relationship can stem from multiple sources.\n\nIf you don't trust your therapist, let them know how you're feeling. Sometimes we are grappling with our own challenges around trust, which a therapist can help you through if you're honest with them. Other times, it's possible that you and your therapist are simply not the right fit.\n\n**Finding a New Therapist**\n\nIf you find yourself realizing that you cannot be candid with your therapist because it isn't a good match, you may be wondering how you can find a new therapist.\n\nTo start your search for a new therapist, you can:\n\n*   Ask for referrals\n*   Check online therapy directories\n*   Try an online therapy service\n\n**Questions to Ask a New Therapist**\n\nWhen interviewing a new therapist, ask questions like:\n\n1.  What is their experience working with clients who have concerns similar to yours?\n2.  How do they approach confidentiality and maintaining a safe therapeutic environment?\n3.  Can you describe your therapeutic approach and how it might benefit me?\n\n**A Word From Verywell**\n\nIt can take time to find a therapist that is a good fit and get comfortable in the therapeutic relationship. While navigating your healing journey, honesty with yourself and your therapist is key.\n\nIf you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor.

Causes Prevalence Diagnosis Treatment\n\n**What Is Kleptomania?**\n\nKleptomania is a condition characterized by an irresistible urge to steal. People with kleptomania will steal items that they do not need, that they could afford to buy, or that have little to no monetary value.\n\n*   Stealing results in feelings of gratification, relief, and even pleasure.\n*   Feelings of guilt and remorse following the crime are common.\n*   Kleptomania does not involve theft for personal gain.\n*   The items themselves may hold little to no monetary value.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nA repeated failure to resist the impulse to steal\nStealing items of no value or that one does not need\nFeelings of relief or pleasure during the theft\n\n**What Else Could It Be?**\n\nKleptomania can occur alongside other conditions, including:\n*   Mood disorders\n*   Panic disorder\n*   Separation anxiety disorder\n*   Body dysmophic disorder\n*   Obsessive compulsive disorder\n*   Other impulse control disorders\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact causes of kleptomania are not well understood. Possible explanations include:\n\n1.  The Psychoanalytic Approach: Stealing as a way to symbolically compensate for an early loss or neglect.\n2.  The Cognitive-Behavioral Approach: Stealing as a learned behavior, reinforced by positive consequences.\n3.  The Biological Approach: Stealing linked to brain dysfunction and neurotransmitter imbalances.\n\n**Prevalence**\n\nKleptomania is thought to be relatively rare, with estimates suggesting a lifetime prevalence of between 0.3 to 0.6% of the population.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis typically involves:\n\n*   Patient interviews\n*   Review of legal records\n*   Administering psychometric scales such as the Kleptomania Symptoms Assessment Scale (K-SAS) or the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, Modified for Kleptomania (K-YBOCS)\n\n**Treatment**\n\nCommon treatments include:\n\n1.  Medications: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as well as other antidepressants.\n2.  Psychotherapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy targets both the thoughts and behaviors that contribute to stealing.\n\nEarly intervention and effective treatment are crucial in helping individuals with kleptomania manage their symptoms and avoid legal consequences. Treatment may also involve addressing co-occurring conditions, such as substance use disorders or anxiety disorders. If you suspect that you or someone you know has kleptomania, consult a mental health professional for proper evaluation and treatment.  [1]. Internal tension builds before the theft and is relieved by committing the theft. Individuals with kleptomania may be in public settings when they experience the urge to steal, which can lead to legal consequences such as arrest and incarceration. The secretive nature of the disorder and associated feelings of guilt and shame can interfere with diagnosis and treatment. It's estimated that between 3.8% and 24% of shoplifters have symptoms consistent with kleptomania, making it a relatively rare condition. Diagnosis may involve patient interviews, review of legal records, and administering psychometric scales such as the Kleptomania Symptoms Assessment Scale (K-SAS) or the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, Modified for Kleptomania (K-YBOCS).

The secretive nature of the disorder makes it difficult to determine the prevalence of kleptomania. However, studies suggest that between 3.8% and 24% of shoplifters have symptoms consistent with kleptomania. This indicates that kleptomania may be more common than previously believed. Diagnosis involves assessing the individual's behavior and emotional state, as well as reviewing their history of substance use, anxiety disorders, and other mental health conditions. Treatment for kleptomania typically involves a combination of medication and therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or psychodynamic therapy. Medications like SSRIs can help reduce symptoms of kleptomania by increasing serotonin levels in the brain. Therapy can also help individuals develop coping strategies to manage their urges and behaviors. In some cases, kleptomania may be a symptom of an underlying condition, such as a mood disorder or anxiety disorder. Addressing these conditions through therapy and medication can often help alleviate symptoms of kleptomania.  [3].

Many people have an idea of what traditional talk therapy looks like with adults, and they might have an idea of what play therapy looks like with young children. Adolescents are a distinct group, no longer children but not yet adults, and as such have unique needs. Working in adolescent psychology means considering the specific needs of someone whose brain has developed past the childhood stage but has not fully matured into adulthood.\n\n### The History of Adolescent Psychology\nThe concept of adolescence is relatively new, having only been recognized in the United States starting in the late nineteenth century. Previously, adolescents were essentially seen as miniature adults. However, we currently understand that development continues throughout the lifespan, meaning that teenagers are different from adults developmentally. Specifically, decades of research have shown that adolescents undergo significant brain development, impacting their behavior and functioning during this phase.\n\n### What Is Typical Teen Behavior?\nA common question for parents is, How do I know what is typical teen behavior? Although it is expected for adolescents to question their parents, push back on boundaries, and experience some growing pains as they develop their sense of self, it can be challenging for parents to identify what falls outside of that range of typical development. Parents might struggle with balancing enforcing healthy boundaries and fostering a positive relationship with their teens.\n\n### Therapy With Adolescents\nBecause adolescent brains are different than adult brains, therapy with adolescents does not look the same as therapy with adults. Things parents can keep in mind if their adolescent is in therapy include:\n\n1. Relationship is key.\n2. The most important part of any therapeutic relationship is trust and rapport with the therapist, and this is especially true for adolescents.\n3. Privacy and confidentiality are essential.\n4. Many parents want to know what happens in their teen's therapy sessions.\n5. Curiosity is understandable; however, demanding that the teen or therapist disclose information from sessions will often do more harm than good.\n6. Laws vary by state, but parents might have the right to this information.\n7. In this case, letting the adolescent know that their parent will respect their privacy can allow them to engage and benefit from their sessions.\n\n### What Is the Storm and Stress View of Adolescence?\nThe storm and stress view of adolescence is a concept where it's believed that adolescents are particularly prone to emotional turmoil due to the significant changes they experience during this phase. This view suggests that adolescents often struggle with mood swings, impulsivity, and rebellious behavior as they navigate their identity and independence.\n\n### How to Find a Therapist\nIf your teen needs therapy, it is OK. A parent cannot control everything that happens to their child, and no parent is perfect. Recognizing that the adolescent needs therapy and support from adults other than the parents is part of good parenting and does not indicate that the parent has somehow failed their child.\n\nAdolescents have needs that differ from both younger children and adults. When determining their psychological needs and providing appropriate care, it is essential to understand their unique phase of life and meet them where they are. How to find a therapist and resources for further information can be found in the 'Read More' section below. \n\n## Read More\nPSYCHOLOGY THEORIES 7 Sources\n\n### Dr. Amy Marschall's Bio\nDr. Amy Marschall is an autistic clinical psychologist with ADHD, working with children and adolescents who also identify with these neurotypes among others.

What to Know About Internal Family Systems (IFS) Therapy\n\n**Overview**\nInternal family systems, or IFS, is a type of therapy that believes we are all made up of several parts or sub-personalities.\n\n*   It draws from structural, strategic, narrative, and Bowenian types of family therapy.\n*   The founder of IFS therapy, Dr. Richard Schwartz, thought of the mind as an inner family and began applying techniques to individuals that he usually used with families.\n*   The underlying concept of this theory is that we all have several parts living within us that fulfill both healthy and unhealthy roles.\n\n**The Self in IFS Therapy**\n\n*   The goal of IFS therapy is to find your Self and bring all of these parts together.\n*   It suggests that it is your core Self that is who you truly are.\n*   The therapy process promotes healing, trust in the Self, and the coordination of all components.\n\n**Techniques of IFS Therapy**\n\n*   While there may be infinite parts within you, there are three main types:\n    *   Firefighter parts\n    *   Manager parts\n    *   Exile\n*   A six-step process is used to help you find these parts and release their burdens.\n1.  Find: Identify a part to work with.\n2.  Focus: Turn your attention inward and focus on the identified part.\n3.  Flesh Out: Learn more about the part, including its emotions, color, age, or other characteristics.\n4.  Feel Toward: Explore how you feel about this part and its role in your life.\n5.  Befriend: Develop a sense of acceptance and compassion for the part.\n6.  Fear: Understand what fears this part may have.\n\n**What to Expect**\n\n*   Your first session will cover basic information about IFS therapy and an initial assessment.\n*   You'll build a comfortable, trusting rapport with your therapist.\n*   Each session involves talk therapy and exploring inner parts of the Self.\n\n**Benefits of IFS Therapy**\n\n*   It can help with general life stressors like grief, relationship, and career issues.\n*   Improve resilience and self-esteem.\n*   Treat several mental health issues, including anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, dissociative identity disorder, eating disorders, and substance use disorders.\n\n**Effectiveness of IFS Therapy**\n\n*   Research shows that IFS therapy can reduce signs of depression and pain symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n*   It was added to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's National Registry for Evidence-Based Programs and Practices.\n*   The registry rated it as effective and promising for various mental health conditions.\n\n**Things to Consider**\n\n*   You may feel worse before you feel better, especially when facing problems.\n*   If you're experiencing suicidal thoughts or engaging in self-harm, talk to your therapist or seek help from a national helpline.\n*   IFS therapy might not be suitable for individuals with schizophrenia or active delusions.\n\n**How to Get Started**\n\n*   Find a certified IFS therapist using the IFS Institute's directory.\n*   Set up a consultation to discuss your preferences and find a good fit.\n*   Begin working on identifying parts and building connections between them. 1. \"Trauma-related dissociative symptoms, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD): A review of the evidence.\" Journal of Clinical Psychology 75.9 (2019): 1823-1834. doi: 10.1002/jclp.22920\n2. \"Internal Family Systems Therapy for Eating Disorders: A Case Series.\" The Cognitive Behavioral Therapist 21.1 (2020): 23-33. doi: 10.1017/S1537647120000038\n3. \"The Effects of Internal Family Systems Therapy on Childhood Trauma and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms in Adults: A Pilot Study.\" Journal of Clinical Psychology 76.1 (2020): 47-56. doi: 10.1002/jclp.22923\n4. \"Internal Family Systems therapy for depression: A pilot study.\" Journal of Clinical Psychology 70.1 (2014): 15-25. doi: 10.1002/jclp.22034\n5. \"The Effects of Internal Family Systems Therapy on Pain Symptoms in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.\" Journal of Clinical Psychology 72.3 (2016): 236-244. doi: 10.1002/jclp.22333\n6.

These include:\n\n*   Intimate partner violence, as mentioned earlier.\n*   Suicidal ideation or self-harming behaviors that require immediate intervention beyond what traditional therapy can provide.\n\n**What If You Decide That Therapy Isn't Right For You at This Time?**\n\nIf you realize that therapy might not be right for you right now, there are many resources out there that can help you manage your own mental health if you're otherwise feeling relatively stable and safe. These include:\n\n*   Recognizing what your baseline is by thinking about who you are when you're calm and at ease.\n*   Engaging in activities that bring you joy.\n*   Considering group therapy, which is often cheaper than individual therapy.\n*   Seeking out a peer support specialist.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nEven if you've heard people say that anyone and everyone can and should go to therapy, sometimes it's just not what's best for you at the moment. Listen to yourself and be respectful of your needs. If it doesn't feel like the right time or if it's outside of your budget, deciding not to go to therapy can actually be the right choice.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.  \"The Benefits of Therapy.\" Verywell Mind.\n2.  \"How therapy compares to a raise in making us happy.\" The Guardian.\n3.  \"Money vs. therapy: which is more effective at making people happier?\" BBC News.\n4.  \"Anger Management Techniques.\" Verywell Mind.\n5.  \"Couples therapy and intimate partner violence.\" Psychology Today.\n6.  \"The Best Combination of Therapy and Medication for Severe Mental Illness.\" Healthline.\n7.  \"Online Group Therapy: Is It Right for You?\" GoodTherapy.org.\n8.  \"Peer Support Specialists: What Are They and How Can They Help?\" Verywell Mind.\n9.  \"What is a Peer Support Specialist?\" Psychology Today.\n\nThe information in this article was last updated on January 10, 2025.

{"title": "What Is Gate Control Theory?", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-gate-control-theory-2795208", "content": "on This Article Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles. Read our editorial policy to learn more about how we fact-check and keep our content accurate, reliable, and trustworthy.\n\n**What Is Gate Control Theory?**\n\nGate control theory suggests that the spinal cord contains a neurological 'gate' that either blocks pain signals or allows them to continue on to the brain.\n\n*   Unlike an actual gate, which opens and closes to allow all things to pass through, the gate in the spinal cord differentiates between fiber types when carrying pain signals.\n*   Specifically, pain signals traveling via small nerve fibers are allowed to pass through the gate while signals sent by large nerve fibers are blocked.\n\n**History**\n\nGate control theory was first proposed by researchers Ronald Melzack and Patrick Wall in 1965. The purpose of this theory was to help explain how mental states impact the perception of pain, either reducing or increasing pain sensations.\n\n*   Prior to gate control theory, scientists had other theories on pain, including:\n    *   Specificity theory of pain\n    *   Intensity theory of pain\n    *   Pattern theory of pain\n\n**How Gate Control Theory Works**\n\nFollowing an injury, pain signals are transmitted to the spinal cord, then up to the brain. Melzack and Wall suggest that along the way, pain messages encounter nerve gates that control whether these signals are allowed to pass through.\n\n*   The gating mechanism takes place in the dorsal horns of the spinal cord.\n*   Both small nerve fibers (pain fibers) and large nerve fibers (normal fibers for touch, pressure, and other skin senses) carry information to two areas of the dorsal horn.\n*   One part of the dorsal horn that receives information is the transmission cells.\n*   The other is inhibitory interneurons that either halt or impede the transmission of sensory information.\n\n**Impact**\n\nGate control theory has had a significant impact on our understanding of pain perception and management. It has prompted additional research in this area and contributed to the development of new therapeutic approaches.\n\n*   Gate control theory is used to explain why massage and touch can be helpful pain management strategies during childbirth.\n*   The theory is also used to explain the benefits of dance and music for relieving labor pain.\n\n**How to Use Gate Control to Reduce Pain**\n\nThe gate control theory suggests that finding ways to close the gate between the spinal cord and brain may help reduce pain. There are several strategies you can use to do this, including:\n\n1.  Focusing on something else\n2.  Getting regular exercise\n3.  Relaxing\n4.  Staying optimistic\n5.  Using counter-stimulation techniques\n\n**Potential Pitfalls of Gate Control Theory**\n\nWhile gate control theory is one of the most influential theories of pain perception, it is not without problems. Many of the ideas suggested by Melzack and Wall have not been substantiated by research.\n\n*   The theory contradicts some aspects of human biology.\n*   It failed to explain both phantom pain and chronic pain issues.\n*   A new theory of brain function was proposed in 1996 to better explain complex pain issues. \n\n**A Word From Verywell**\n\nGate control theory may not explain every aspect of how people experience pain, but it has helped transform approaches to pain management. The gate control theory is still a useful concept for understanding the psychological factors that influence pain perception and management. While it may have its limitations, gate control theory remains an important contribution to our understanding of pain and its treatment. \n\n**Sources**\n\n1\\. Melzack, R., & Wall, P. D. (1965).

It encompasses the biological influences, social pressures, and environmental factors that affect how people think, act, and feel.\n\nWhat Is Psychology?\n\nAPA Format The APA format is a set of citation and formatting guidelines developed by the American Psychological Association (APA). These guidelines provide writers with a consistent formula for acknowledging the works of others, notes on how to order, structure, and format a paper, as well as practical writing and grammar tips. APA format is used by students and professionals in a variety of disciplines, including business, economics, nursing, and, of course, psychology.\n\nHow to Write a Paper in APA Format\n\nVariable A variable is something that can be changed or altered, such as a characteristic or value. Variables are generally used in psychology experiments to determine if changes to one thing result in changes to another.\n\nTypes of Variables in Psychology Research Correlation\n\nA correlation coefficient, often expressed as r, indicates a measure of the direction and strength of a relationship between two variables. Correlational studies are quite common in psychology, particularly because some things are impossible to recreate or research in a lab setting. Instead of performing an experiment, researchers may collect data to look at possible relationships between variables.\n\nWhat Is a Correlation?\n\nAbstract\n\nThe abstract is the second page of a lab report or APA-format paper and should immediately follow the title page. Think of an abstract as a highly condensed summary of your entire paper. The purpose of your abstract is to provide a brief yet thorough overview of your paper.\n\nHow to Write an APA Abstract\n\n**EXPLORE STUDENT RESOURCES**\n\nDescriptive Research in Psychology\n\nHow Qualitative Data Is Used in Psychology\n\nHow Snowball Sampling Used in Psychology Research Confounding Variables in Psychology Research Convenience Sampling in Psychology Research Understanding Socratic Questioning: A Comprehensive Guide What Does Social Darwinism Say About Mental Health?

Find out which option is the best for you. Table of Contents Techniques Uses Benefits Effectiveness Things to Consider How to Get Started\n\n**What Is Psychoanalytic Therapy?**\n\nPsychoanalytic therapy is a form of talk therapy based on Sigmund Freud's theories of psychoanalysis.\n\nThe approach explores how the unconscious mind influences your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.\n\nSpecifically, it examines how your experiences (often from childhood) may be contributing to your current experience and actions.\n\n**Techniques**\n\nPeople undergoing psychoanalytic therapy often meet with their psychoanalyst at least once a week.\n\nThey can remain in therapy for months or even years.\n\nPsychoanalysts use a variety of techniques to gain insight into your behavior.\n\nSome of the more popular techniques include:\n\n1. Dream interpretation: According to Freud, dream analysis is by far the most important psychoanalytic technique.\n2. Free association: Free association is an exercise during which the psychoanalyst encourages you to freely share your thoughts.\n3. Transference: Talking about these feelings can help your psychoanalyst understand how you interact with others.\n\n**Uses**\n\nPsychoanalytic therapy may be used to treat a number of different psychological conditions, including:\n\n*   Anxiety\n*   Depression\n*   Emotion struggles or trauma\n*   Identity problems\n*   Self-esteem issues\n*   Self-assertion\n*   Psychosomatic disorders\n*   Relationship issues\n*   Self-destructive behavior\n*   Sexual problems\n\n**Benefits**\n\nWhat makes psychoanalytic therapy different from other forms of treatment?\n\nA review of the research comparing psychoanalytic approaches to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) identified seven features that set the psychoanalytic approach apart.\n\n1.  Focuses on emotions.\n2.  Explores avoidance.\n3.  Identifies recurring themes.\n4.  Exploration of past experienced.\n5.  Explores interpersonal relationships.\n6.  Emphasizes the therapeutic relationship.\n7.  Free-flowing.\n\n**Effectiveness**\n\nSuccess often hinges on the ability to confront potentially stressful or triggering experiences.\n\nWhile some critics have derided the success rates of psychoanalytic therapy, research suggests that both long- and short-term psychoanalytic therapy can effectively treat a range of conditions.\n\n*   Symptom Reduction: One review of the effectiveness of long-term psychoanalytic therapies found moderate to large success rates for reducing symptoms of a variety of psychopathologies.\n*   Lasting Improvements: People who receive psychoanalytic treatment tend to retain these gains. Most continue to improve even after therapy ends.\n\n**Things to Consider**\n\nAs with all treatment methods, there are also potential downsides that should be considered.\n\nThis form of therapy tends to require ongoing sessions.\n\nTraditional psychoanalysis could involve three to five sessions a week for several years, however psychoanalysis psychotherapy is less frequent and may be undertaken once to twice a week.\n\nDepending on how long your therapy lasts, the costs can mount up.\n\nPsychoanalytic therapy can also be an intense process. It involves evoking emotional responses and often challenges established defense mechanisms.\n\n**How to Get Started**\n\nIf you think you or someone you love would benefit from psychoanalytic therapy, the first step is to seek out a trained professional.\n\nTo find a qualified psychoanalyst, start by asking your primary care physician for recommendations.\n\nYou can also search the directory available on the American Psychoanalytic Association's website. Friends who have had a good experience with psychoanalytic treatment can also be another good source of recommendations. If you do not have a good referral from someone you know, there are a number of online psychoanalyst networks and directories that can point you in the right direction.\n\nOnce you have identified a potential psychoanalyst, make a call to set up an initial consultation. During this consultation, you can further explore if psychoanalytic therapy is the right approach for you.\n\nPsychoanalytic therapy is just one mental health treatment approach that you may want to consider. Always talk to your doctor or therapist to determine which psychotherapy method might be the most effective for your individual needs.

{"title": "Erotomania: Signs, Symptoms, Treatment, and Examples in Pop Culture", "url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/erotomania-signs-symptoms-treatment-examples-in-pop-culture-7556088", "content": "with Us\n\n**Erotomania: Signs, Symptoms, Treatment, and Examples in Pop Culture**\n\n**What Is Erotomania?**\n \nErotomania is a psychiatric disorder characterized by the delusional belief that another person, usually of higher social status, is profoundly in love with the affected individual despite no evidence or reciprocation.1 It's also known as De Cl√©rambault's Syndrome, named after Ga√´tan Gatian de Cl√©rambault, a French psychiatrist who extensively studied this condition.\n\n**Historical Background**\n\nGa√´tan Gatian de Cl√©rambault was born in the late 19th century and worked tirelessly to understand erotomania. He meticulously studied patients, predominantly women, who exhibited characteristic symptoms of this condition. De Cl√©rambault found that they maintained unshakable beliefs in their imagined romance despite objective evidence to the contrary or the object of affection's denial.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) categorizes erotomania as a type of delusional disorder. The criteria for diagnosing erotomania include:\n\n1.  The presence of delusions lasting one month or longer\n2.  There's no evidence that symptoms could indicate schizophrenia\n3.  There's no marked impairment of daily functioning or obviously odd and bizarre behavior\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\nTreating erotomania can be challenging due to the nature of delusional beliefs. Treatment often involves medication, especially antipsychotics, which can help manage delusions and prevent them from getting worse.\n\n*   Therapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), can also be a beneficial add-on to medication.\n*   CBT focuses on identifying and changing thought patterns that can contribute to delusional beliefs.\n\n**Impact of Erotomania**\n\nThe impact of erotomania on a person's life can be devastating. Fixating on the delusional romantic relationship often consumes a significant portion of the person's daily life, leading to neglect of personal responsibilities, including work and relationships.\n\n*   The constant pursuit and obsession can lead to stalking behaviors, which may result in legal issues.\n*   It can also be distressing and potentially dangerous for the person who is the object of the delusional affection. They may feel harassed or threatened. \n\n**Examples in Pop Culture**\n\nSome famous cases of erotomania include:\n\n1.  John Hinckley Jr., who attempted to assassinate President Ronald Reagan, fixated on actress Jodie Foster.\n2.  Mark David Chapman, who murdered John Lennon, was believed to suffer from erotomania.\n3.  The Netflix series 'You' revolves around a character named Joe Goldberg, who becomes obsessed with women he believes are in love with him.\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n*   Does erotomania involve genuine love? No, it involves delusional beliefs about love rather than genuine mutual affection.\n*   Is erotomania always harmful? Yes, erotomania is harmful as it involves delusional thinking and can lead to significant personal, social, and sometimes legal consequences for the person and the object of their obsession. \n*   Can family members help someone with erotomania? While family members can be supportive, it's crucial to encourage a person with erotomania to seek professional help. They need to recognize the severity of the condition and the need for professional intervention. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nUnderstanding, identifying, and treating erotomania is critical to mitigating its potentially devastating effects on the lives of those affected and the people around them. Through medication, therapy, and support, people with erotomania can work towards managing their symptoms and improving their quality of life. \n\n1.  De Cl√©rambault's Syndrome is also known as erotomania.\n2.  The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) categorizes erotomania as a type of delusional disorder.\n3.  Treatment often involves medication, especially antipsychotics, which can help manage delusions and prevent them from getting worse.\n4.  CBT focuses on identifying and changing thought patterns that can contribute to delusional beliefs.\n5.  The impact of erotomania on a person's life can be devastating due to the neglect of personal responsibilities and potential legal consequences.\n6.  It is crucial for family members to support a person with erotomania in seeking professional help.\n\n**References**\n\n1.  Toketemu Ohwovoriole\n2.

Cognitive behavioral therapists help you become aware of your problems and the thoughts, emotions, and beliefs about your problems.\n\n*   Identify the exact belief thought process the experiment will target\n*   Brainstorm ideas for the experiment\n*   Predict the outcome and devise a method to record the outcome\n*   Anticipate challenges and brainstorm solutions\n*   Conduct the experiment\n*   Review the experiment and draw conclusions\n\n**Examples of Behavioral Experiments**\n\nPsychotherapists may assist you in designing a behavioral experiment that can counteract almost any distorted way of thinking. Here are a few examples:\n\n1.  **Confronting Perfectionism**: A woman believes people will only like her if she is perfect. Her perfectionist tendencies create a lot of stress and anxiety.\n2.  **Overcoming Social Anxiety**: A man believes he's socially awkward. Consequently, he rarely attends social events-and when he does, he sits in the corner by himself.\n3.  **Dealing with Infidelity Fears**: A woman worries her boyfriend is cheating on her. She checks his social media accounts throughout the day to see what he is doing.\n4.  **Improving Sleep Hygiene**: A man struggles to stay asleep at night. When he wakes up, he turns on the TV and watches it until he falls asleep again.\n5.  **Managing Depression**: A woman with depression doesn't go to work on days when she feels bad. On these days she stays in bed all day watching TV.\n\n**Getting Started**\n\nIf you're interested in testing some of the potentially self-limiting beliefs you've been holding onto, try designing your own behavioral experiment. If you're not certain how to get started, want some help designing the experiment, or would like to learn more about how to recognize irrational beliefs, then contact a cognitive behavioral therapist.\n\n**References**\n\n*   By Amy Morin, LCSW\n*   Updated by Hannah Owens, LMSW\n\n**Share Your Thoughts**\n\nYou can share your thoughts about this article with us.

Block, MD\n\nIka84 Getty Images\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\nHow the Stress-Vulnerability Model Works\nEpigenetics\nHow to Boost Protective Factors\nCriticisms\nStress affects everybody, but not all of us respond to it in the same way. The stress-vulnerability model, also known as the diathesis-stress model, helps explain why some people are more susceptible to mental health ailments.\n\nThe model was developed in 1977 by Zubin and Spring to explain the development of schizophrenia. After its initial introduction to the mental health world, the model extended to include a broad range of psychiatric diagnoses.1 There is no simple explanation for why mental illness happens. That's because, in most cases, there are many factors that play a role.\n\nThe vulnerability-stress model helps researchers and mental health practitioners understand how genetics and stress intersect to affect a person's risk of experiencing mental health problems. Keep reading to learn more about the vulnerability- stress model, some criticism it has received, the impact stress can have on us, and ways to boost protective factors to fight against stress.\n\n**How the Stress-Vulnerability Model Works**\n\nThe stress-vulnerability model suggests that the risk of developing a psychiatric disorder comes down to two big factors: biological vulnerability and stress. But there is good news, too. Protective factors-like a strong social support system, self-care, and healthy coping strategies-can help dial down both biological vulnerability and stress.\n\nElements of the Stress-Vulnerability Model\n\n1. Biological Vulnerability\n2. Stress\n3. Protective Factors\n\n**Biological Vulnerability**\n\nBiological vulnerability refers to one's genetic predisposition. For example, bipolar disorder is known to have a genetic link and is often passed down in families.2 Biological vulnerability also accounts for experiences that could have occurred in the womb or as a baby.1\n\n**Stress**\n\nWhile stress can contribute to developing a mental health disorder, it isn't the only factor at play. For example, someone may already have a genetic predisposition to a mental health disorder, but they have not developed it yet. If a person is genetically predisposed to a mental health condition, a major life event or a series of stressful events can trigger the onset of a mental health disorder.\n\nExamples of these life stressors include:\n\n*   Life crises (e.g., death of a loved one, major illness)\n*   Substance use\n*   Personal and job-related stressors\n\nWhen this significant life crisis occurs, some of the disorder's symptoms can emerge. However, remember that the probability of this depends on the type of psychiatric condition the person is predisposed to.1\n\n**Protective Factors**\n\nProtective factors are critical for keeping stress and biological vulnerability in check. Think of them as your mental health safety net. Such factors can include:\n\n*   Having a solid support system-people who listen, communicate well, and have your back\n*   Following a structured daily routine-consistent habits are important for mental health\n*   Keeping stress levels low(ish)-while it's sometimes easier said than done, setting boundaries to help keep the chaos to a minimum can go a long way toward protecting your peace\n\n**Epigenetics**\n\nAnother element of the stress vulnerability model is called epigenetics. Epigenetics speaks to how our environment, behaviors, and lifestyle can change our genes. These changes begin before you are even born, meaning you are impacted by the environment, behaviors, and lifestyles of your lineage. However, your epigenetics also change throughout your life.\n\nThis is positive because it indicates that some epigenetic changes can be reversed. A simple example of this is how some former smokers can reach the same DNA methylation as non-smokers.4 Again, this is more evidence that we aren't destined to be vulnerable simply based on our gene expression.\n\n**Generational Trauma**\n\nEpigenetics is also a component of generational trauma. For example, some of the stress experienced during a mother's pregnancy will then influence the baby's gene expression. This can lead to strengths and vulnerabilities.5 There is also research indicating that epigenetics can expand across multiple generations, with some pivotal research specifically focusing on generational trauma resulting from structural racism creating adverse health outcomes in the Black community.6\n\nAgain, it is important to remember that gene expressions can be shifted. Just because we experienced stress while in utero or because we have come from an oppressed lineage does not mean we are destined to be sick.7 Protective factors are immensely helpful in ensuring that we are not limited based on our genes.\n\n**How to Boost Protective Factors**\n\nDecreasing stress is a great way to minimize your vulnerability to developing severe ailments. However, this may seem challenging while living in an already complicated world. Rather than solely focusing on reducing stress, let's consider how you can build upon your protective factors:\n\n*   Assess your current points of stress and take a look at your community resources\n*   What is your support system like?\n*   Do you have any hobbies or talents?\n\n**Criticisms**\n\nWhile the Stress-Vulnerability Model has been instrumental in helping us better understand psychiatric ailments, it hasn't been without its critics. The Term 'Vulnerability' Is Limiting\n\nA 2022 article published in Frontiers in Sociology found the model's focus on vulnerability to be disempowering. Noting the nearly 50 years that have passed since the model was introduced, the article found the model's emphasis on vulnerability to be a distraction from the actual harm at hand.1 For example, if one's form of stress is abuse at the hands of caregivers, simply removing the caregivers will not solve the issue of stress as a key vulnerability.\n\nInstead, there must be support from individuals who understand the needs of someone who has experienced abuse.1\n\n**Takeaways**\n\nWe all experience different types of stress throughout our lives, but the lingering impact it has on our health and well-being can vary depending on things like our biological vulnerabilities and coping mechanisms. Some people are more susceptible, which is why it's important to take steps to manage your stress and get the support you need.\n\nIf you're experiencing stress or trauma,", "category": "general"},

The first step is to congratulate yourself for taking the first step toward your mental health treatment journey (it's a big one). Starting therapy is a personal decision, so it's essential to decide which environment and schedule may work best for you. For example, you might want to consider online therapy if you prefer the convenience of meeting with your therapist over video or via a phone call in the comfort of your own home. 2. Find a Therapist The next step is to find a provider you'd like to work with. There are many different places where you can begin looking for a therapist, including: - Insurance directory: Check with your health insurance provider to see if they have a directory of therapists who accept your insurance. - Recommendations from friends: Friends who have had great experiences with a particular therapist can be an excellent resource when you are looking for a treatment provider. - Referrals from your doctor: Your primary care provider can also be an excellent place to start your search. - Mental health organizations: Many mental health organizations, including the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) and the American Psychological Association, maintain therapist directories listing professionals who are qualified to treat different conditions. - Online therapy directories: You can also do an online search to find therapist directories where you can search based on a therapist's education, identities (including racial, cultural, gender, and sexual identities), treatment specialty, therapeutic approach, experience, and geographic location. - Online therapy platforms: Many online sites also ask you to provide some basic information on what you'd like to address in therapy, such as anxiety, parenting issues, or substance use. Then, they will give you several therapists to choose from or assign you a therapist based on your answers.\n\n**What Is Therapy?**\n\nTherapy, also known as psychotherapy or talk therapy, refers to the techniques that help people change behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that cause problems or distress.\n\n*   Problems alleviated by therapy can include difficulties in dealing with loss, stress at home or work, working through trauma, and coping with symptoms of specific mental conditions.\n*   Research shows that therapy can help reduce depression, anxiety, and eating disorder symptoms, as well as those struggling with addiction.\n\n**Do I Need Therapy?**\n\nYou don't need to be dealing with a clinically diagnosed mental health condition to try therapy - anyone can benefit from seeking support to manage their mental health.\n\n*   If stressors are interfering with your day-to-day, whether at home, work, or in your interpersonal relationships, it may be time to see a therapist.\n*   Therapy is not just for those dealing with serious mental health issues; it's also a great way to improve yourself and gain life-long solutions. - AMY MORIN, LCSW\n\n**How Much Does Therapy Cost?**\n\nTherapy may cost, on average, anywhere between $60-$200 per hour, though costs vary depending on a number of factors.\n\n*   Online providers tend to be on the lower end of that range at $60 to $100 per week, while in-person therapy sessions will usually cost between $100 and $200.\n*   Suffice it to say, cost can be a massive barrier to treatment. - AKEEM MARSH, MD\n\n**How Does Therapy Work?**\n\nWhen you've found a provider you might be interested in working with, it's best practice to schedule a consultation, which many providers will offer for free.\n\n*   This will give you the chance to learn more about the therapist and give them a preliminary idea of what you are looking for.\n*   During the first session, your therapist may ask you: What are your symptoms? What brought you to therapy? What might make your life better? What are your goals for treatment?\n\n**How Long Does Therapy Take?**\n\nDepending on your issue and therapy goals, therapy can last a few sessions or several months or years.\n\n*   While you likely want to know how long it's going to take to feel better, there's no simple answer. It's very individualized.\n*   In addition, some insurance plans only cover a set number of sessions in a given year, so you may need to factor in those limitations and/or work with your therapist to come up with a payment plan.\n\n**How to Get Started With Therapy**\n\nThe first step is to congratulate yourself for taking the first step toward your mental health treatment journey (it's a big one).\n\n*   Starting therapy is a personal decision, so it's essential to decide which environment and schedule may work best for you.\n*   For example, you might want to consider online therapy if you prefer the convenience of meeting with your therapist over video or via a phone call in the comfort of your own home.\n\n**Techniques and Types of Therapy**\n\nDepending on the condition being treated, there are many different approaches to talk therapy catered to the individual's unique needs.\n\n*   The type of approach may also depend on the expertise of the mental health professional.\n*   Learn more about some of them below. - \n\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a type of psychotherapy that emphasizes acceptance of negative thoughts, feelings, symptoms, and circumstances rather than trying to change them or make them more positive.\n\nBehavioral Therapy Behavioral therapy adopts a number of techniques to help with identifying and changing your negative or self-destructive behaviors.\n\nCognitive Therapy Cognitive therapy looks to help you become aware of and change negative and dysfunctional ways of thinking.\n\nCouples Therapy Couples therapy is a form of psychotherapy that can help you and your partner at any stage of your relationship regardless of marital status, age, race, faith, or sexual orientation.\n\nDialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a modified type of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Its main goals are to teach you how to live in the moment, develop healthy ways to cope with distress, regulate your emotions, and improve your relationships with others.\n\nEMDR Therapy Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is a psychotherapy that uses rhythmic left-right (bilateral) stimulation to help people recover from trauma or other distressing life experiences. It is an approach that essentially re-trains your brain when remembering traumatic events.\n\nFamily Therapy Family therapy is a type of treatment designed to help with issues that specifically affect families' mental health and functioning.\n\n**A Word From Verywell**\n\nWhether you are looking for help with a specific condition or just more general support for your everyday life, therapy can be a great choice. You can see a therapist in person or online and should look for a provider with whom you get along and trust. - \n\nIllustration by Ellen Lindner Read More: THERAPY 2 Sources Updated by Hannah Owens, LMSW See Our Editorial Process Meet Our Review Board Share Feedback on This Article Was this article helpful?
