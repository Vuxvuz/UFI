Women and Mental Health

Why is women’s mental health important?

 Some mental disorders are more common in women than men, including depression, anxiety disorders, and eating disorders.

There are also disorders unique to women. For example, some women experience symptoms of depression at times of hormone change, such as: 

• During or after pregnancy (perinatal depression)
• Around the time of their period (premenstrual dysphoric disorder)
• During the menopause transition (perimenopausal depression)
When it comes to other mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, research has not found sex differences in the rates at which they are diagnosed. But certain symptoms may be more common in women, and the course of illness can be affected by a person’s sex. Researchers are beginning to tease apart the various biological and psychosocial factors that may impact mental health.

Mental health includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Learn more about caring for your mental health.

What are symptoms of mental disorders in women?

Why should women participate in clinical trials?

 Clinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions. The goal of a clinical trial is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe. Although people may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, they should know that the primary purpose is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others can be better helped in the future. 

Researchers at NIMH and around the country conduct many studies with women. We have new and better treatment options today because of what clinical trials have uncovered. Talk to a health care provider about clinical trials, their benefits and risks, and whether one is right for you.

NIMH researchers are currently working to identify the causes of, treatments for, and predictors of mood disorders unique to women, including:

• Postpartum depression
• Premenstrual dysphoric disorder
• Perimenopausal depression
In addition to these disorders, NIMH researchers are also studying other mental disorders that affect women.

Our studies take place at the NIH Clinical Center  in Bethesda, Maryland, and require regular visits. If you don’t live nearby, you can find a clinical trial near you .

Sex can influence health in important ways. You can help researchers learn more and advance health care for all people. NIMH is committed to ensuring that people have all the information they need to feel comfortable and make informed decisions before participating in a study.
