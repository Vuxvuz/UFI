What is PTSD?

People may have a range of reactions after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, such as a natural disaster, act of violence, or serious accident. Common reactions include feeling anxious, sad, or angry; having trouble concentrating and sleeping; and thinking about what happened. Most people will recover from these symptoms, and their reactions will lessen over time.

People may be diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) if their symptoms last for an extended period after a traumatic event and begin to interfere with aspects of daily life, such as relationships or work. People who have PTSD may continue to feel stressed or frightened, even though they are not in danger.

Why is NIMH studying PTSD?

 The symptoms of PTSD can cause significant distress and interfere with a person’s ability to engage in daily activities, including sleeping and eating. People with PTSD often have co-occurring conditions, such as depression, substance use, or anxiety disorders.

Aspects of the traumatic event and certain biological and social factors may make some people more likely to develop PTSD. For instance, previous exposure to adversity and other traumatic experiences, especially in childhood, can increase a person’s chance of developing PTSD later in life. While many people who live through a dangerous event experience some symptoms initially, most do not develop PTSD—multiple factors play a part.

How is NIMH research addressing this critical topic?

 NIMH is supporting research to understand the factors that influence a person’s mental health after a potentially traumatic event. Researchers are working to understand what causes specific PTSD symptoms and why symptoms differ in type and severity from person to person. This includes research on biological, cognitive, behavioral, and developmental factors. NIMH-supported research is also studying ways to identify which trauma survivors are likely to recover naturally and which survivors may benefit from treatment.

NIMH-supported research is also focused on developing and improving mental health treatments that can help trauma survivors. This includes research to identify treatment components that can lead to more effective medications, psychotherapies, and device-based treatments. We’re also supporting research on ways to deliver effective treatment across different settings and populations. This includes developing approaches to prevention and intervention that meet the specific needs of children, teens, and young adults.
