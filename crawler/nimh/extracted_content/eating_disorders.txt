What are eating disorders?

Eating disorders are serious illnesses marked by severe disturbances in a person’s eating behaviors. Although many people may be concerned about their health, weight, or appearance on occasion, some become fixated or obsessed with weight loss, body weight or shape, and controlling their food intake. These may be signs of an eating disorder.

Why is NIMH studying eating disorders?

 Eating disorders are serious and can be life-threatening. In addition, people with eating disorders are at higher risk for medical complications and co-occurring mental illnesses, including depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders. These co-occurring conditions can make eating disorders worse. Eating disorders can be treated successfully. Early detection and treatment are important for a full recovery.

How is NIMH research addressing this critical topic?

 NIMH is funding and conducting research to understand why certain people are more likely to develop eating disorders than others. This includes research that examines genetic, biological, behavioral, psychological, and social factors. We’re also supporting research to better understand how an eating disorder behavior, such as restrictive eating, may impact a person’s brain and gut.

We’re supporting research to expand the reach and effectiveness of current therapies. This includes research that leverages technology to engage people in treatment and personalizes interventions to improve treatment response. We’re also funding research into novel treatment options, including medications and behavioral therapies that can prevent or reverse unhealthy food-related behaviors.
