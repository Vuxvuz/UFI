What is suicide?

Suicide is when people harm themselves with the intent of ending their life, and they die as a result. A suicide attempt is when people harm themselves with the intent of ending their life, but they do not die.

People of all backgrounds can be at risk of suicide. Suicidal behavior is complex, and there is no single cause.

Why is NIMH studying suicide prevention?

 Suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States and a major public health concern. When a person dies by suicide, the effects are felt by family, friends, and communities.

Data show that some communities experience higher rates of suicide than others. Effective, evidence-based programs and treatment options can help prevent suicide.

How is NIMH research addressing this critical topic?

 NIMH is supporting and conducting research to understand who is at risk of suicide and why. This includes research that examines ways to identify individuals at increased risk and identifies groups and communities that are disproportionately affected by suicide.

We’re also supporting research that evaluates the effectiveness of different suicide prevention programs. This includes programs in health care, community, school, and justice system settings. It also includes efforts to provide effective programs and practices focused on suicide prevention.

Additionally, we’re funding practice-based suicide prevention research centers that aim to speed the translation of effective interventions and services into practice. And we’re supporting research to develop and test fast-acting treatments that can reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
