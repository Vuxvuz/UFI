What is HIV?

HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, is the virus that causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). HIV can be transmitted during sexual intercourse, by sharing syringes, or during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.

Without medication, HIV can weaken the immune system and increase a person’s chances of having other infections and diseases. With effective medication, people with HIV can lead long, healthy lives.

Science updates

 NIMH news about HIV and mental health, including press releases and highlights on the latest research findings.

Why is NIMH studying HIV and mental health?

 People with HIV have a higher chance of developing mood, anxiety, and cognitive disorders. People may feel sadness or grief after acquiring HIV. They may also experience stress related to living with HIV or exposure to discrimination and social stigma.

In addition, HIV and other infections can affect the brain and nervous system. Some HIV medications may cause symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleeplessness and may make some mental health issues worse.

Having a mental disorder may make HIV prevention and treatment more challenging for some people. Identifying effective ways to support the mental health of people with HIV can help improve HIV treatment and overall patient well-being.

How is NIMH research addressing this critical topic?

 NIMH funds and conducts research to help reduce HIV transmission globally and improve the quality of life for people with HIV. We’re supporting studies to understand how HIV affects the brain and how to support people’s mental health to improve HIV prevention and treatment. Researchers are also looking at ways to increase access to mental health treatments in real-world settings.

Additionally, NIMH supports behavioral research aimed at preventing HIV and improving the health and well-being of people with HIV. We also fund research on structural and social factors to improve treatment and access to care.

NIMH is one of several NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices that support data-driven research aimed at understanding, treating, and ultimately curing HIV. This includes work to develop new data tools and techniques that may make it easier for people to access HIV testing services, receive comprehensive HIV treatment and care, and stick with their medication plans.
