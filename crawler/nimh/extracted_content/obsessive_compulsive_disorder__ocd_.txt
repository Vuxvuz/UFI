What is OCD?

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder marked by uncontrollable and recurring thoughts (obsessions), repetitive and excessive behaviors (compulsions), or both. OCD symptoms can begin any time but usually start between late childhood and young adulthood.

Why is NIMH studying OCD?

 OCD symptoms are often time-consuming and can cause significant distress or interfere with daily life. It is common for people with OCD also to have a diagnosed mood or anxiety disorder. Although there is no cure for OCD, available treatments can help people manage their symptoms, participate in day-to-day activities, and improve their quality of life.

How is NIMH research addressing this critical topic?

 NIMH funds and conducts research to better understand who is at risk for developing OCD. This includes research into genetics, biology, temperament, and childhood trauma, as well as studies of OCD in children and adults. We’re supporting research to improve existing treatments for OCD, including psychotherapy, medication, and brain stimulation therapy. We’re also funding research investigating new treatments, particularly for people with treatment-resistant OCD whose symptoms haven’t improved after trying multiple treatment options.
