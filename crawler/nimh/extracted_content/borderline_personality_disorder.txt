What is borderline personality disorder?

Why is NIMH studying borderline personality disorder?

 Borderline personality disorder can cause significant challenges to a person’s relationships and emotional well-being. People with borderline personality disorder are more likely to engage in self-harm. They may also experience symptoms of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, substance use disorder, or eating disorders.

These challenges can lead to significant distress and a lower quality of life. Effective treatments can help people with borderline personality disorder manage their symptoms, support their well-being, and improve their daily functioning.

How is NIMH research addressing this critical topic?

 NIMH funds research to explore how a person’s biology and environment contribute to borderline personality disorder. One focus includes studying the influence of genetic and brain-based differences and the impact of cultural and social factors.

We’re also supporting research evaluating the effectiveness of established treatments, such as dialectical behavior therapy, and emerging therapies and medications. Additionally, we are committed to identifying promising avenues for improving early intervention and personalized treatment approaches for people living with borderline personality disorder.
