Men and Mental Health

Why is men’s mental health important?

 Mental disorders affect men and women. The prevalence of several mental disorders is lower in men than in women. However, other disorders are diagnosed at comparable rates for men and women or at higher rates for men, like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Men are also more likely to die by suicide than women, according to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .

Certain symptoms may also be more common in men than women, and the course of illness can be affected by a person’s sex. Researchers are only now beginning to tease apart the various biological and psychosocial factors that may impact mental health.

Men are less likely to have received mental health treatment than women in the past year. Recognizing the signs that you or someone you love may have a mental disorder is the first step toward getting treatment. The earlier that treatment begins, the more effective it can be.

Mental health includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Learn more about taking care of your mental health.

What are the symptoms of mental disorders in men?

 Men and women can develop most of the same mental disorders and conditions, but they may experience different symptoms. Some common symptoms include:

• Anger, irritability, or aggressiveness
• Noticeable changes in mood, energy level, or appetite
• Difficulty sleeping or sleeping too much
• Difficulty concentrating, feeling restless, or on edge
• Increased worry or feeling stressed
• Misuse of alcohol, drugs, or both
• Persistent sadness or feelings of hopelessness
• Feeling flat or having trouble feeling positive emotions
• Engaging in high-risk activities
• Aches, headaches, or digestive problems without a clear cause
• Obsessive thinking or compulsive behavior
• Thoughts or behaviors that interfere with work, family, or social life
• Thoughts of death or suicide or suicide attempts
Mental disorders can be treated: A primary care provider is a good place to start if you’re looking for help. They can refer you to a qualified mental health professional, such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, or clinical social worker, who can help you figure out next steps. Find tips for talking with a health care provider about your mental health.

Why should men participate in clinical trials?

 Clinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions. The goal of clinical trials is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe. Although people may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, they should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others may be better helped in the future.

Researchers at NIMH and around the country conduct many studies with patients and healthy volunteers. We have new and better treatment options today because of what clinical trials have uncovered.  Talk to a health care provider about clinical trials, their benefits and risks, and whether one is right for you.

Sex can influence health in important ways. You can help researchers learn more and advance health care for all people. NIMH is committed to ensuring that people have all the information they need to feel comfortable and make informed decisions before participating in a study.
