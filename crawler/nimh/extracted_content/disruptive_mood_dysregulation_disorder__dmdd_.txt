What is DMDD?

DMDD is a mood disorder in which children and adolescents experience ongoing irritability and anger and have frequent, intense temper outbursts. Many children go through periods of moodiness, but children with DMDD experience severe symptoms that are present in multiple settings and impact daily life.

Why is NIMH studying DMDD?

 Children with DMDD may have trouble in school and difficulty maintaining healthy relationships with family or peers. They also may have a hard time in social settings or participating in activities such as team sports. They often require mental health care, including doctor visits and sometimes hospitalization. Children with DMDD are also more likely to develop anxiety and depression in the future.

How is NIMH research addressing this critical topic?

 DMDD was recognized as a disorder in 2013. Because the diagnosis is relatively new, few DMDD-specific treatment studies have been conducted. Current treatments often focus on what has been helpful for other childhood disorders associated with irritability, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and anxiety disorders. These treatment options include adapting specific forms of psychotherapy for children with DMDD and teaching behavior management skills to parents. NIMH funds studies to improve these treatment options and identify new treatments specifically for children with DMDD.

The exact causes of DMDD are unclear. NIMH-supported research is investigating the environmental, social, and biological factors that contribute to the disorder.
