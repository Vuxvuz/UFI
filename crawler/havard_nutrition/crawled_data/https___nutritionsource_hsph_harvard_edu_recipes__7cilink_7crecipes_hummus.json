Classic hummus doesn’t contain the ingredients such as roasted peppers, spinach, artichokes, or sun-dried tomatoes seen in many supermarket brands, but if you want to add any of these to your hummus, have fun being creative! You can serve hummus with pita bread or with cucumbers, radishes, carrots, and bell peppers.\n\nHummus\nRecipe courtesy of Chef Joyce Goldstein\nServes 8\nIngredients:\n\n1 ¾ cup (one 15-ounce can) chickpeas, drained and rinsed\n1 cup sesame tahini (also called sesame butter)\n½ cup fresh lemon juice\n2 garlic cloves, finely minced\n1 to 2 tablespoons cold water\n½ teaspoon salt\n½ teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground\n¼ teaspoon cayenne red pepper (optional)\n½ teaspoon cumin, ground (optional)\n\nOptional garnishes:\n\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n3 tablespoons flat leaf parsley, chopped\n3 tablespoons pomegranate seeds\n½ teaspoon cumin, ground\n½ teaspoon cayenne pepper or Aleppo pepper\nPreparation:\n\nIn a food processor combine the tahini, lemon juice, garlic, water, salt, pepper, and optional spices, if desired. Pulse to combine.\nAdd the chickpeas and process until smooth. You may need to add more water if the consistency is too thick. Add enough cold water to achieve a spreadable consistency.\nWhen you’re ready to serve, spoon the hummus onto a shallow plate. Note that if you make hummus ahead of time, the mixture will thicken as it stands, in which case you may need to thin it with water. Smooth the hummus with a spoon or spatula. If desired, sprinkle with olive oil, parsley, or other optional garnishes listed.\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/8 of recipe245 calories8 grams of protein20 grams of carbohydrates4 grams of fiber265 milligrams of sodium15 grams of fat( 2 grams of saturated fat6 grams of monounsaturated fat7 grams of polyunsaturated fat)\nHEALTHY OILS\nWATER\nVEGETABLES\nFRUITS\nHEALTHY PROTEIN\nWHOLE GRAINS\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
