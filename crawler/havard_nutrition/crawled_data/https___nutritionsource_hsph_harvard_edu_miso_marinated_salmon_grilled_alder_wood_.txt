Miso-marinated salmon grilled on alder wood
Miso-marinated salmon grilled on alder wood
Recipe courtesy of Guy Crosby
Cook Time 15 - 20 min.
Serves 2
Ingredients:

1 pound salmon filet, skin-on
¼ cup (4 tablespoons) white or red miso paste
1/8 cup (2 tablespoons) brown sugar
1.5 tablespoons mirin or rice wine
1.5 tablespoons sake
Preparation:

Wisk miso, brown sugar, sake, and mirin together in a small bowl until the sugar and miso are dissolved, forming a thick liquid.
Place salmon skin-side down into a baking dish and coat evenly on all sides with the miso mixture. Pour any remaining miso mixture over the fish. Wrap the dish in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours.
Submerge alder wood plank in water for 2 hours before grilling.
Light gas or charcoal grill and clean grate. Place wet plank on grate and heat for 5 minutes. Rub excess miso glaze from surface of salmon and place skin-side down on plank.
Grill for approximately 15 to 20 minutes depending on the thickness of the salmon filet, and how well done one desires the fish. Fifteen minutes produces fish with slightly translucent interior (about 125 degrees Fahrenheit), while twenty minutes produces fish with opaque center.
Divide fish in two and serve with lemon slices.
Serve with sautéed spinach and garlic, and roasted tomatoes stuffed with seasoned goat cheese.
