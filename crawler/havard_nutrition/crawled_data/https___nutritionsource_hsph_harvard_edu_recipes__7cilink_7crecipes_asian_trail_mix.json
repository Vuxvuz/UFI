Bring this mixture to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook at this level for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the nuts to sit in the liquid overnight.\n\nDay 2\n\nThe following day preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Drain the peanuts in a colander and pat them dry. Spread the nuts evenly on a baking sheet and bake them in the middle of the oven for about 30 minutes, shaking the sheet occasionally to redistribute the nuts so they will brown evenly. Reduce the heat to 300 degrees Fahrenheit and check the peanuts every 10 minutes to catch them when they are fully roasted and no longer moist in the center. Allow to cool.\nEach of the additional nuts can be toasted to their own baking sheet in the same oven until a light golden, about 15 minutes. Season lightly with salt and allow to cool.\nCombine the cooled nuts with the dried fruit and candied ginger. Store the trail mix in an airtight container.\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1 ounce, or 1/32 of recipe140 calories4 grams of protein12 grams of carbohydrates2 grams of fiber290 milligrams of sodium10 grams of fat( 2 grams of saturated fat6 grams of monounsaturated fat2 grams of polyunsaturated fat)\nHEALTHY OILS\nWATER\nVEGETABLES\nFRUITS\nHEALTHY PROTEIN\nWHOLE GRAINS\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
