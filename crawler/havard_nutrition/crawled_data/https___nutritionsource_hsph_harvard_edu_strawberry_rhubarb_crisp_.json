One strategy for incorporating more fruit into your diet is to eat fruit for dessert, or to create desserts that are mostly fruit. This dessert is an example of this strategy. Each serving of this dessert provides a full serving of fruit. The addition of whole grains, nuts, and olive oil make this a very satisfying dessert your family and guests will enjoy.\n\nStrawberry Rhubarb Crisp\nRecipe courtesy of The Culinary Institute of America\nCook Time 35 - 40 min.\nServes 12\nIngredients:\n\n6 cups fresh or frozen rhubarb (about 1 ½ pounds), cut into ½-inch pieces\n3 cups fresh strawberries, quartered\n¼ cup light brown sugar\n2 teaspoons finely grated lemon or orange peel\n1 cup old-fashioned oatmeal\n½ cup almond flour or finely ground almonds\n½ cup brown sugar\n1/3 cup whole wheat flour\n6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\n3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\nPreparation:\n\nIn a large mixing bowl combine the rhubarb, strawberries, brown sugar, and lemon or orange zest.
