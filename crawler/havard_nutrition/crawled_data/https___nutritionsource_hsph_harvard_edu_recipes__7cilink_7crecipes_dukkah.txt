Dukkah
Recipe courtesy of The Culinary Institute of America
Serves Makes 1 cup
Ingredients:

1 cup almonds
½ cup sesame seeds
1/3 cup coriander seeds
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon sugar
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Preparation:

In a large sauté pan over medium heat, dry roast the almonds for 5 to 6 minutes. Remove the almonds from the pan, allow them to cool a few minutes, and then finely chop them.
Toast the sesame seeds and coriander separately, in the same pan used to toast the almonds, over moderate heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until fragrant. With a spice or coffee grinder, grind the coriander in short bursts until reasonably fine and add to a bowl along with the nuts and sesame seeds.
Using the spice or coffee grinder, or a mortar and pestle, grind the cumin, salt, and sugar together until very fine. Taste and adjust seasoning to your own taste. Add to the sesame-nut mixture. Dukkah will stay fresh in an airtight container for up to 4 weeks.
