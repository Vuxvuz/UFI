Spicy Chicken Kebabs

This chicken kebab recipe mixes bold spices with citrus to develop a zesty marinade. Skewering grapes with the chicken is another way to build flavor without adding salt. One kebab makes a great appetizer, or serve two kebabs on a green salad for a delicious, healthful meal.

Spicy Chicken Kebabs
Serves 12
Ingredients:

2 garlic cloves
Pinch of salt
1 tsp. coriander seeds
¾ tsp. paprika
¾ tsp. cumin seed
½ tsp. dried thyme
¼ tsp. crushed red pepper
1 tsp. curry powder
black pepper, to taste
3 Tbsp. canola oil
1 Tbsp. lemon juice
1 Tbsp. parsley, chopped
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into 1-inch cubes
About 1 pound of red grapes
Preparation:

In a mortar, pound the garlic with a pinch of salt to make a paste.
In a dry skillet, heat the coriander seeds, paprika, cumin seeds, thyme, crushed red pepper, and curry powder until hot and aromatic, about 30 seconds. Remove from pan and put the mixture into a spice grinder or mortar and pestle. Grind to make a fine powder.
In a bowl, combine the garlic paste, spices, canola oil, lemon juice, parsley, pepper, and chicken cubes. Toss well to coat completely and let marinate several hours, mixing occasionally.
Skewer the chicken and grapes and grill until chicken is cooked through.
