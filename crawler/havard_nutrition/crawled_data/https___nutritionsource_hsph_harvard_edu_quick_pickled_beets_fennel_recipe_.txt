Quick-Pickled Beets & Fennel

Add a burst of color to your tabletop with bright beets and crisp fennel. An easy recipe that you can prepare in advance, this recipe shows another way to prepare veggies – no oven required!

Ingredients (Serves 16, as a garnish or “pickle”)
2 large beets (we used Chioggia beets)
1 medium bulb of fennel
3/4 cup red wine vinegar
3/4 cup water
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon peppercorns (optional)
a few sprigs of fennel frond (optional)
Instructions

To prepare the vegetables

Slice off the tops and bottoms of the beets, then use a mandoline or sharp knife to slice into very thin rounds. Remove the fennel fronds, and slice the bulb into thin strips.
Pack the sliced fennel and beets into a pint-sized canning jar or heat-proof container. Top with peppercorns and sprigs (if using).

To prepare the brine

In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar, water, and salt. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring occasionally.

To finish

Pour the mixture into the canning jar or other heat-proof container with the fennel and beets.
Let the mixture cool to room temperature. These quick pickles can be served immediately or refrigerated for later consumption. The pickles will continue to ferment as they sit in the refrigerator, and will keep well for up to a week.
