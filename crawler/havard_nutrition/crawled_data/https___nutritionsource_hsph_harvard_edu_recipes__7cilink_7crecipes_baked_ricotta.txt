Baked Ricotta with Rosemary and Pepper Flakes

This is a wonderful addition to any brunch. The flavorful baked ricotta can be used as a spread for toasted whole grain bread. The rosemary adds a wonderful citrus note and the pepper flakes add a little heat. This is also great cooked with scrambled eggs.

Serves 8
Ingredients:

2 cups part-skim ricotta cheese
1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary
