Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo

Serve this Cajun specialty over brown rice.

Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo
Recipe courtesy of Susan Guillory
Cook Time 1.5 hrs.
Serves 6-8
Ingredients:

2 cups chopped okra
4 tablespoons sesame oil
1 large onion, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
½ sweet green pepper, chopped
½ bunch parsley (with stems), chopped (1 cup)
8 to 10 scallions, chopped
4 cloves garlic, crushed and minced
1 cup roux (see recipe below)
2 quarts water
1 4-pound chicken, cut up
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
4 bay leaves
½ teaspoon dried thyme
¾ pound shelled shrimp

Roux

1 cup sesame oil
2 to 2¼ cups whole wheat pastry flour
Preparation:

Sauté the okra in 2 tablespoons oil until the soft and ropy texture is gone, 10 to 15 minutes. Set it aside.
In a large saucepan heat the remaining oil and sauté the onions, celery, sweet green pepper, parsley, scallions, and garlic until wilted and softened, about 7 minutes.
Add the roux and water. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring constantly, then add the okra, chicken, cayenne, bay leaves, and thyme. Lower the heat and simmer the mixture for at least 1 hour. Fifteen minutes before serving, add the shrimp. Remove the bay leaves and serve the gumbo over brown rice.

Roux (Makes 2¾ cups)

Stir the oil and flour together in a large, heavy saucepan. Cook over very low heat, stirring constantly, for 25 minutes. The roux will turn a dark golden brown and have the consistency of heavy cream.
Cool the roux and store in a tightly covered jar in the refrigerator, where it will keep in good condition for several months.
