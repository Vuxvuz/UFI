Asian Trail Mix
Asian Trail Mix
Recipe courtesy of The Culinary Institute of America
Serves Makes 2 pounds
Ingredients:

½ pound peanuts (about 1½ cups)
1 heaping tablespoon Szechuan peppercorns
1 heaping tablespoon star anise
1 cinnamon stick
2 teaspoons salt
1/8 teaspoon sugar
2½ cups water
4 ounces cashews (about ¾ cup)
4 ounces macadamia nuts (about ¾ cup)
4 ounces blanched almonds (about 7/8 cup)
2 teaspoons salt
4 ounces raisins (about ¾ cup)
4 ounces golden raisins (about ¾ cup)
4 ounces candied ginger
Preparation:


Day 1

In a medium saucepan, combine the peanuts with the spices, salt, sugar, and water. Bring this mixture to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook at this level for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the nuts to sit in the liquid overnight.

Day 2

The following day preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Drain the peanuts in a colander and pat them dry. Spread the nuts evenly on a baking sheet and bake them in the middle of the oven for about 30 minutes, shaking the sheet occasionally to redistribute the nuts so they will brown evenly. Reduce the heat to 300 degrees Fahrenheit and check the peanuts every 10 minutes to catch them when they are fully roasted and no longer moist in the center. Allow to cool.
Each of the additional nuts can be toasted to their own baking sheet in the same oven until a light golden, about 15 minutes. Season lightly with salt and allow to cool.
Combine the cooled nuts with the dried fruit and candied ginger. Store the trail mix in an airtight container.
