Guacamole
Guacamole
Recipe courtesy of The Culinary Institute of America
Serves 12
Ingredients:

2 medium avocados
1½ tablespoons freshly-squeezed lime juice
1 garlic clove, minced
2 tablespoon white onion, finely chopped and rinsed
1 to 2 serrano chiles, finely chopped
1 small tomato, cut into a ¼-inch dice
Salt to taste
Preparation:

Cut the avocado in half lengthwise all the way to the pit and then twist the two halves apart. Remove the pit by scooping it out with a spoon and then, with the same spoon, scoop the flesh into a small mixing bowl.
Mash the avocado with a fork to a coarse puree, and then add the lime juice and garlic.
Stir in the onion, tomato, and chili. Taste and season with salt.
If not serving immediately, press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the guacamole to prevent browning and refrigerate, preferably not for more than a few hours.
