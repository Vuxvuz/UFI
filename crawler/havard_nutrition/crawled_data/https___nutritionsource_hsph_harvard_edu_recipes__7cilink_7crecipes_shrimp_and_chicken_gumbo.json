Set it aside.\nIn a large saucepan heat the remaining oil and sauté the onions, celery, sweet green pepper, parsley, scallions, and garlic until wilted and softened, about 7 minutes.\nAdd the roux and water. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring constantly, then add the okra, chicken, cayenne, bay leaves, and thyme. Lower the heat and simmer the mixture for at least 1 hour. Fifteen minutes before serving, add the shrimp. Remove the bay leaves and serve the gumbo over brown rice.\n\nRoux (Makes 2¾ cups)\n\nStir the oil and flour together in a large, heavy saucepan. Cook over very low heat, stirring constantly, for 25 minutes. The roux will turn a dark golden brown and have the consistency of heavy cream.\nCool the roux and store in a tightly covered jar in the refrigerator, where it will keep in good condition for several months.\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/8 of recipe450 calories34 grams of protein15 grams of carbohydrates3 grams of fiber150 milligrams of sodium27 grams of fat( 6 grams of saturated fat11 grams of monounsaturated fat10 grams of polyunsaturated fat) 135 milligrams of cholesterol\nHEALTHY OILS\nWATER\nVEGETABLES\nFRUITS\nHEALTHY PROTEIN\nWHOLE GRAINS\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
