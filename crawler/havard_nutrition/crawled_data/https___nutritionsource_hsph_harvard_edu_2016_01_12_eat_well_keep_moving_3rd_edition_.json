The program began as a joint research project between the Harvard School of Public Health (presently the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health) and Baltimore Public Schools. In extensive field tests among students and teachers using the program, children ate more fruits and vegetables, reduced their intake of saturated fat, watched less TV, and improved their knowledge of nutrition and physical activity.\n\nThis new third edition provides educators with the following:\n\nThoroughly updated nutrition and activity guidelines to keep current with the latest and best information available\n48 multidisciplinary lessons that supply students with the knowledge and skills they need for choosing healthy eating and activity behaviors\nLessons that address a range of learning outcomes and that can be integrated across multiple subject areas, such as math, language arts, social studies, and visual arts\nA new Kid’s Healthy Eating Plate, created by nutrition experts at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public health, that offers children clear guidance in making healthy choices and complements the USDA’s MyPlate\nEight “Principles of Healthy Living” messages, including new core messages on water consumption and on sleep (along with two new related lessons)\n\n \n\nVisit eatwellandkeepmoving.org to sample lessons, download tools for food service and family involvement, and learn more about Eat Well & Keep Moving’s integrative, evidence-based approach.\n\n \nPosted on\nJanuary 12, 2016  Faculty Books\nPREVIOUS\nNEW!
