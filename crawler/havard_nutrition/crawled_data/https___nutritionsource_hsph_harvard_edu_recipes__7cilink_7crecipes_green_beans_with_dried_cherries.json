Set the sauce aside.\nPlace the beans in a small steamer basket, and place the basket in a pot with a tightly fitting lid, above an inch of boiling water. Cover and cook over medium-high heat for about 3 minutes, keeping the beans slightly crisp.\nToss the steamed green beans with the cherry glaze, season with salt to taste (if desired), and serve.\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/4 of recipe140 calories3 grams of protein28 grams of carbohydrates5 grams of fiber10 milligrams of sodium\nHEALTHY OILS\nWATER\nVEGETABLES\nFRUITS\nHEALTHY PROTEIN\nWHOLE GRAINS\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
