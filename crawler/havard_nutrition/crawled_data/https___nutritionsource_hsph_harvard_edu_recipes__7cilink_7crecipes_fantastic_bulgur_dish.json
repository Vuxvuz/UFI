Plain kitchen scissors are the best utensil for cutting dried tomatoes. Tiny yellow cherry tomatoes look and work best in this dish. If you can only get larger ones, cut them in half. If you can only get red ones, that will be okay, too. Chopped Roma tomatoes will work as well.\n\nFantastic Bulgur Dish\nRecipe courtesy of Mollie Katzen/Harvard University Dining Services\nCook Time 50 min.\nServes 6\nIngredients:\n\n1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil\n2 cups tiny cherry tomatoes (½ pound)—yellow ones, if available, or diced Roma tomatoes\n½ cup dried tomatoes, minced (1 ounce)\n1 tablespoon minced garlic\n¾ teaspoon salt\n1½ cups coarse bulgur\n2 cups water (room temperature or warmer)\n¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes to taste\n1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice to taste\n2 to 3 teaspoons light-colored honey to taste\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1 cup chopped walnuts, lightly toasted\nRoasted walnut oil\nWedges of lemon\nPreparation:\n\nHeat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, deep nonstick skillet. Add the cherry tomatoes and sauté over high heat for about 5 minutes.\nStir in the dried tomatoes and the salt. Continue cooking over high heat for about 2 to 3 minutes longer (cherry tomatoes might begin to pop open from the heat, and that’s fine).\nTurn the heat down. Add the garlic and bulgur (and a little more oil, if it seems dry), and sauté over medium-low heat for about 2 minutes. Stir in the water, bring to a boil, then turn the heat down as low as possible. Cover and simmer for 35 minutes or until the bulgur is tender.\nTransfer to a serving bowl, and fluff with a fork to let the steam escape so that the bulgur won’t become mushy. Taste to adjust salt, then add red pepper flakes, lemon juice, honey, and black pepper to taste.\nServe hot or warm, topped with walnuts and a drizzle of roasted walnut oil, and garnish with lemon wedges.\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/6 of recipe340 calories9 grams of protein46 grams of carbohydrates6 grams of fiber300 milligrams of sodium15 grams of fat\nHEALTHY OILS\nWATER\nVEGETABLES\nFRUITS\nHEALTHY PROTEIN\nWHOLE GRAINS\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
