To keep the salad crisp and refreshing, we salt cabbage for an hour to drain off extra moisture that would otherwise water down the dish. For an intense, savory but bright dressing, we pair toasted sesame oil and fresh lime juice. A dash of fish sauce brings a subtle funk and richness. We even add sliced celery, doubling down on the crunch factor. This slaw is perfect paired with a piece of fish or chicken, or enjoyed on its own for a light lunch.\n\nSprouted Lentil, Cabbage, and Celery Slaw\nRecipe courtesy of Tim Chin\nServes 6\nIngredients:\n\n1 small head green cabbage, cored and chopped fine\n2 teaspoons salt\n1 cup sprouted lentils\n2 ribs celery, sliced thin\n2 scallions, sliced thin\n½ cup chopped fresh cilantro\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n3 tablespoons toasted sesame oil\n¼ cup lime juice (about 2 limes)\n1 tablespoon fish sauce\n1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds, plus extra for serving\n½ teaspoon ground cumin\nPreparation:\n\nToss cabbage and salt in colander set over medium bowl.
