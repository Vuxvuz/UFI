Pour any remaining miso mixture over the fish. Wrap the dish in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours.\nSubmerge alder wood plank in water for 2 hours before grilling.\nLight gas or charcoal grill and clean grate. Place wet plank on grate and heat for 5 minutes. Rub excess miso glaze from surface of salmon and place skin-side down on plank.\nGrill for approximately 15 to 20 minutes depending on the thickness of the salmon filet, and how well done one desires the fish. Fifteen minutes produces fish with slightly translucent interior (about 125 degrees Fahrenheit), while twenty minutes produces fish with opaque center.\nDivide fish in two and serve with lemon slices.\nServe with sautéed spinach and garlic, and roasted tomatoes stuffed with seasoned goat cheese.\nHEALTHY OILS\nWATER\nVEGETABLES\nFRUITS\nHEALTHY PROTEIN\nWHOLE GRAINS\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
