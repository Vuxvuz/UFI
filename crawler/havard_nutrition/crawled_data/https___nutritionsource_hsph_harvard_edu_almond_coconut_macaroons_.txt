Almond Coconut Macaroons

These fluffy macaroon cookies make a satisfying substitute for the standard sugary version. Add a few dark chocolate chips to create a perfect, homey dessert. (See more recipes from Always Delicious). 

Almond Coconut Macaroons
Prep Time 5 minutes
Cook Time 7-9 minutes
Serves 24 cookies
Ingredients:

1 1/2 cups almond flour
1 cup unsweetened finely shredded coconut
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
6 tablespoons avocado oil
1/4 cup honey
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
Preparation:

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine the almond flour, coconut, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl until well mixed.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the oil, honey, egg, and vanilla.
Mix the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients with a spatula until well combined.
Using a round tablespoon or small ice cream scoop, spoon 1 heaping tablespoon of the dough onto the prepared baking sheet; repeat to make 24 cookies, spacing them 1/2 to 1 inch apart. Distribute any remaining dough among the cookies.
Bake for 7 to 9 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown.
