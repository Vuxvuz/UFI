It is good served either warm or cold. You can garnish with cilantro leaves and a dollop of plain yogurt to add vibrant color and even more fantastic flavor.  Serve with your favorite sandwich and some fresh fruit. The soup can be stored in the refrigerator for up to five days. It can also be frozen and reheated.\n\nCauliflower Tomato Soup with Indian Spices\nRecipe courtesy of Amy Myrdal Miller\nCook Time 30 - 40 min.\nServes 6\nIngredients:\n\n2 tablespoons canola oil\n1 teaspoon coriander seeds\n1 teaspoon mustard seeds\n1 teaspoon ground turmeric\n½ teaspoon cumin seeds\n½ teaspoon red pepper flakes\n½ teaspoon ground coriander\n1 medium white or yellow onion, chopped\n1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes\n1 pound fresh or frozen cauliflower, cut into florets\n4 cups water\n¼ teaspoon kosher salt\n½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n½ cup plain, low-fat yogurt, for garnish\n½ cup cilantro leaves, for garnish\nPreparation:\n\nIn a 4-quart stock pot combine the canola oil, coriander seeds, mustard seeds, turmeric, cumin seeds, red pepper flakes, and ground coriander.
