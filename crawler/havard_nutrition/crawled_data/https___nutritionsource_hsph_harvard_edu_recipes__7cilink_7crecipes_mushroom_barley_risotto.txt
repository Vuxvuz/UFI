Mushroom Barley Risotto
Mushroom Barley Risotto
Recipe courtesy of Harvard University Dining Services
Cook Time 45 min.
Serves 4
Ingredients:

1 cup pearled barley
2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium carrot, peeled and diced
½ medium onion, diced
1 medium stalk celery, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup mushrooms, washed and sliced
1 medium tomato, diced
1 tablespoon fresh chives, minced
1 tablespoon fresh tarragon, minced
2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
Salt (optional) and pepper to taste
Preparation:

Rinse the barley. Pour the broth into a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the barley and return to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until all the broth is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
After the barley has been cooking for about 10 minutes, start the vegetables: Heat the oil in a sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the carrot and onion and cook until the onion is translucent. Add the celery, garlic, and mushrooms and cook until mushrooms begin to sweat, about 4 minutes.
Gently fold the carrot mixture, diced tomato, chives, and tarragon into the barley. Season with salt (if desired) and pepper to taste. Top with chopped parsley and serve warm.
