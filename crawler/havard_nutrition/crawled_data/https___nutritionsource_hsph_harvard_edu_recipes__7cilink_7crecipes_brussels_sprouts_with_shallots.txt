Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Shallots and Walnut Oil
Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Shallots and Walnut Oil
Recipe courtesy of Harvard University Dining Services
Cook Time 30 min.
Serves 4
Ingredients:

1 pound Brussels sprouts
1 shallot, peeled and chopped fine
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon walnut oil or hazelnut oil
Salt and pepper to taste
Preparation:

Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
Prepare the Brussels sprouts: Remove the tough outer leaves. Wash off any dirt. Cut off the ends of the stems and score the bottom of each Brussels sprout with an X.
Toss the Brussels sprouts with 1 tablespoon of oil and pepper to coat evenly. Place in a baking dish and roast for 20 to 30 minutes, or until tender when pierced with a fork.
Remove Brussels sprouts from the oven and sprinkle with the chopped shallots. Add the other tablespoon of oil to the pan, toss using a spoon or spatula, and return to the oven. Roast until shallots are browned.
Remove from oven to a warm serving platter and drizzle with walnut oil. Season with pepper to taste, and serve.
