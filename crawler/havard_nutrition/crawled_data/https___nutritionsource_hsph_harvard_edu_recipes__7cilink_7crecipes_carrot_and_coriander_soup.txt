Chef Milind’s Carrot and Coriander Soup
Chef Milind’s Carrot and Coriander Soup
Recipe courtesy of Singapore Health Promotion Board & Milind Sovani
Ingredients:

½ teaspoon canola oil
15-18 peppercorns
2 bay leaves
2 teaspoons fennel seed
1 onion, chopped
1 pound carrots, grated
½ cup chopped green coriander (cilantro)
6 cups water
Salt to taste
½ tablespoon light cream (optional)
Preparation:

Heat the oil in a sauce pan and add the peppercorn, bay leaf, and fennel.
Add in the onions and sauté until light brown, then add in the grated carrots and water. Boil the mixture until the carrot is cooked. Add in the coriander and immediately remove from the heat and let cool.
Remove the bay leaves. Blend the soup and ingredients in a blender to form a smooth paste; strain if necessary.
Heat the strained mixture in a sauce pan and add salt to taste; if the soup is too thick, add a small amount of water and stir, adjusting until reaching desired consistency. Stir in the cream (optional).
Serve hot.
