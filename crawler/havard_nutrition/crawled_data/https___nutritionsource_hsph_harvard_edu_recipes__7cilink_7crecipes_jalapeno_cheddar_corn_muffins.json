(10 g) baking powder\n½ tsp. (2 g) salt\n1 egg yolk\n⅔ cup (130 g) extra virgin olive oil\n½ tsp. (4 g) vanilla extract\n1 Tbsp. (24 g) agave nectar (or honey)\n2 egg whites\n½ cup (66 g) jalapeño peppers, diced\n½ cup (78 g) corn kernels, frozen and thawed\n½ cup (64 g) sharp cheddar cheese, finely shredded\nPreparation:\n\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Line muffin tins with paper liners.\nIn a small mixing bowl, soak the cornmeal in 1 cup of buttermilk and ½ cup of warm water for 10 to 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, mix the white whole wheat flour, whole wheat pastry flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a medium size mixing bowl.\nIn stand mixer that has been outfitted with the paddle attachment beat the egg yolk with the extra virgin olive oil, vanilla, and agave (or honey) for two minutes until combined. Add the cornmeal-buttermilk mixture and mix to combine.\nAdd the dry ingredients in three stages, scraping the bowl down after each addition.\nFold in the jalapeno peppers, corn kernels, and cheddar cheese.\nWhip the reserved egg whites to medium peak. Add a small amount of the white to the batter and mix in, to lighten the batter.
