Drain well, refresh with cold water to set the color, and drain again. Chop coarsely and set aside.\nIn a large sauté pan, add ½ cup of olive oil and sauté the onion until tender, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and hot pepper flakes and cook for a minute. Then add the chopped tomatoes or sauce if using, the optional chickpeas with some of their liquid, and the greens. Heat through. This should be a bit soupy.\nSeason the shellfish with salt and pepper. You may steam them very briefly in the white wine and add the shellfish and wine to the greens. Alternately, you may add the wine along with the tomatoes and cook the shellfish directly in the pan with the greens until the shrimp turn pink, the scallops become opaque, and the squid turns white. The squid will cook in a matter of minutes. Taste the sauce and then season with salt and pepper. Toss with the cooked pasta. Serve at once.\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/6 of recipe695 calories43 grams of protein84 grams of carbohydrates14 grams of fiber425 milligrams of sodium175 milligrams of cholesterol\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
