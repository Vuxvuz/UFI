Vegetable Stock

Ingredients
2 medium leeks
1 medium yellow onion
1-2 cloves of garlic
3-4 medium boiling potatoes
1 lb. button or cremini mushrooms
2 small or 1 medium carrot
2 large stalks celery
Fresh herbs (whatever you can find) –
a few sprigs sage
a few sprigs thyme
a few sprigs rosemary
6-8 sprigs flat-leaf parsley
2 bay leaves
Instructions
Cut the base off of the leeks just above the root, and cut off the top 1” of the green part. Cut the leeks into 1” pieces, put into a bowl of water and swish them around to clean. Let sit for 5 minutes, then lift the pieces out out (don’t pour them out) and place in a colander to drain.
Wash all of the vegetables and cut into 1” chunks. Onion and garlic skins can also be added, but don’t include the onion root.
Add all of the chopped vegetables and herbs to a large stock pot, and cover with cold water so that the vegetables are just submerged. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to low heat so that the pot is barely simmering. Simmer for 1 hour.
After 1 hour, place a colander above another soup pot or dutch oven and strain the stock into the second pot. If you want to, line the colander with cheese cloth, or swap it for a fine-mesh strainer to get a clearer stock.
You can reduce the veggie stock further to concentrate the flavors, or just use it as-is.
