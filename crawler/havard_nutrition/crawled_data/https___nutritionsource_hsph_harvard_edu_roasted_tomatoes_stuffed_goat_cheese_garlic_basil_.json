Slice off a small sliver from bottom of each tomato so they will stand upright in a small ceramic baking dish.\nIn a bowl combine the goat cheese with the egg, garlic, basil, salt, pepper, and one tablespoon of the olive oil. Fill the empty core of each tomato with the goat cheese mixture. Place the top on each tomato and drizzle with the remaining one tablespoon of olive oil.\nEither bake in oven in ceramic baking dish for 30 minutes, or grill directly on the cool side of the grill (not directly over heat) until tender and browned in spots. Let stand for 15 minutes.\nServe as either a side dish or main course, either hot or cooled to room temperature.\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
