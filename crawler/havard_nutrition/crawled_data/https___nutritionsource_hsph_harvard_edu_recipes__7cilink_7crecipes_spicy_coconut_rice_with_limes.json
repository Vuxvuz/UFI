For mild heat, remove the seeds; for more heat, include the seeds.\nBe careful when cutting hot peppers, as the acid can burn the skin. Wear gloves when handling hot peppers, or wash your hands thoroughly afterward. Be especially careful not to touch your eyes or lips with bare or gloved hands that have handled hot peppers.\nPreparation:\n\nIn a medium saucepan, whisk together the rice, water, and coconut milk. Bring to a boil over high heat.\nReduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 50 minutes or until fluffy and all the liquid is absorbed.\nMeanwhile, heat the oil in a sauté pan over medium heat and sauté onions and jalapeno pepper until translucent and tender; do not burn. Remove from heat.\nWhen rice is finished cooking, add ginger, sautéed onions and peppers, lime zest, and lime juice, stir to combine, and serve.\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/4 of recipe250 calories5 grams of protein41 grams of carbohydrates2 grams of fiber15 milligrams of sodium9 grams of fat( 4 grams of saturated fat3 grams of monounsaturated fat2 grams of polyunsaturated fat)\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
