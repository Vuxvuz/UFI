Grilled Eggplant Cutlets

Try this recipe for a quick and delicious summertime appetizer. The firmness of eggplant holds up well to being grilled–and makes a great base for a juicy, ripe tomato.

Grilled Eggplant Cutlets
Recipe courtesy of Harvard University Dining Services
Serves 6
Ingredients:

1 large eggplant or 2 medium ones
2 large tomatoes
2 tablespoons olive oil
¼ cup grated parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon oregano
Salt and pepper
Preparation:

Heat the grill. Slice eggplant into rounds about ¾ inch thick. Slice tomatoes into rounds about ¼ inch thick. Lay all the rounds flat and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Stir oregano into the olive oil in a small separate bowl, and brush mixture lightly onto the eggplant and tomato rounds.
Grill eggplant and tomato rounds, olive oil side down, tomato slices for about 1 minute each, and eggplant slices for about 2 minutes each. Remove from the grill and flip so that the oiled sides are up.
Heat the broiler. Lay out eggplant slices on a baking sheet. Top each slice with a slice of tomato. Sprinkle the eggplant-tomato stacks with parmesan cheese and broil until cheese is bubbly, about two minutes.
