Sprinkle with black pepper and toss again. At this point, the salad can be covered and refrigerated for up to two days.\nServe cold, with a little blue cheese crumbled on top, if desired; note that if you add the blue cheese sooner, it blends into the dressing. If you wait and then sprinkle it on top at serving, it will be more distinct. It’s your call, as this is good either way. You may serve with slices of pear tucked into the side as well; tossing the pear slices with lemon juice prior to plating will help keep them from turning brown. Pass a pepper mill.\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/2 of recipe, including blue cheese270 calories7 grams of protein27 grams of carbohydrates4 grams of fiber420 milligrams of sodium15 grams of fat( 6 grams of saturated fat8 grams of monounsaturated fat1 grams of polyunsaturated fat) 20 milligrams of cholesterol\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
