Cod and Littleneck Clams

Traditionally, this dish would be served with fried potatoes. Whole wheat pasta makes an excellent alternative.

Cod and Littleneck Clams
Recipe courtesy of Richard Vellante
Cook Time 40 min.
Serves 4
Ingredients:

For almond-tomato sauce
½ cup olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
pinch of hot pepper flakes
1 cup sliced onion, ¼-inch thick
1 teaspoon chopped thyme
½ cup sliced basil
2 28-ounce cans whole peeled tomatoes
½ cup rough chopped almonds
1 teaspoon sugar
½ cup capers
For cod and clams
1½ pounds cod
12 littleneck clams
Salt and pepper to taste
Preparation:

To prepare almond-tomato sauce, sauté olive oil, garlic, and hot pepper flakes until garlic is lightly browned in a medium-sized saucepot. Add the onions to the garlic, and cook onions for 10 to 12 minutes until onions are soft.
Once onions are softened, add the thyme, basil, sugar, capers, and almonds. Hand crush tomatoes and add to the saucepot.
Cook on a low simmer for 10 minutes, stir in almonds, cool, and reserve. This can be done a day ahead.
For cod and littleneck clams, preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and place almond–tomato sauce in bottom of ovenproof casserole dish.
Lightly brush cod with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
Place cod on top of sauce in center of casserole dish with clams around outer edge.
