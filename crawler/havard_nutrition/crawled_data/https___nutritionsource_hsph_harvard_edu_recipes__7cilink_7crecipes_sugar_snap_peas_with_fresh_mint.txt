Sugar Snap Peas with Fresh Mint
Sugar Snap Peas with Fresh Mint
Recipe courtesy of Harvard University Dining Services
Serves 4
Ingredients:

1 pound fresh sugar snap peas
1 red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and sliced crossways into 2-inch julienne strips
1 clove garlic, peeled
2 teaspoons canola oil
2 tablespoons fresh mint, finely chopped
Salt (optional) and pepper to taste
Preparation:

Place the sugar snap peas in a small steamer basket, and place the basket above an inch of boiling water in a pot with a tight-fitting lid.
Cover and cook over medium-high heat until the peas are tender yet still slightly crisp, about 2 to 3 minutes. Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with cold water.
Place the peas in the cold water to stop the cooking process, drain in a colander, and set aside.
Heat the canola oil in a sauté pan over medium heat.
Smash the garlic clove with the side of a knife and add it to the oil. Sauté the garlic lightly in the oil and remove it from pan as soon as it starts to brown.
Add the red pepper strips to the pan and sauté until they are tender. Add the peas to the pan and sauté until they are warmed through, about 2 to 3 minutes.
Remove the pan from the heat, toss the mixture with the fresh mint, and serve.
