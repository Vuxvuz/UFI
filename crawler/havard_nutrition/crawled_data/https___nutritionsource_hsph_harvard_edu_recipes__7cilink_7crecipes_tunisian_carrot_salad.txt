Tunisian Carrot Salad
Tunisian Carrot Salad
Recipe courtesy of Nancy Harmon Jenkins
Serves 6
Ingredients:

5–6 medium-size carrots, peeled
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon ground caraway seeds
Sea salt to taste
1 tablespoon harissa
1 tablespoon lemon juice, freshly squeezed
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
Preparation:

Using the large holes of a grater, grate the carrots into a bowl.
In a mortar, pound the garlic to a paste with the caraway and salt. Stir in the lemon juice and harissa, mixing well, then add the olive oil. Beat with a fork or a small wire whisk to amalgamate and immediately pour over the grated carrots. Set aside at room temperature for about 30 minutes to develop the flavors.
