The beans contribute protein and fiber to the salad. Draining and rinsing canned beans reduces the sodium content by 40 percent. This recipe uses a few sodium-rich ingredients (e.g., anchovies and Parmesan cheese), and therefore it does not need any added salt.\n\nCaesar Salad\nServes 6\nIngredients:\n\nFor salad\n6 large hearts of romaine, chopped\nFor dressing\n1 cup white, cannellini, or Great Northern beans, drained and rinsed\n½ cup water\n2 anchovies\n4 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice\n1 garlic clove\n4 Tbsp. grated Parmesan\n½ tsp. black pepper\n½ cup extra virgin olive oil\nFor croutons\n2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil\n2 garlic cloves, finely minced\n½ of an 18-inch whole wheat baguette, cubed\nPreparation:\n\nCroutons: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the olive oil and minced garlic. Add the cubed baguette and toss to coat. Spread the croutons on a baking sheet and bake for 5–8 minutes, or until crisp and golden brown.\nDressing: In the container of a food processor combine the beans, water, anchovy, lemon juice, garlic, Parmesan cheese, and black pepper. Process until smooth. With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil to create a creamy, emulsified dressing.\nChop heart of romaine. In a large mixing bowl combine the chopped lettuce and dressing, tossing well to ensure all of the lettuce is coated with the dressing.\nTo serve, divide the salad among six salad plates, and garnish each plate with croutons.\n\nNutrition information per serving (1/6 of recipe):\n\n375 calories, 11 g protein, 41 g carbohydrate, 11 g fiber, 3 g sugar (0 g added sugar), 447 mg sodium, 21 mg potassium, 18 g fat (3 g sat, 13 g mono, 2 g poly, 0 g trans), 1 mg cholesterol\n\nRecipe courtesy of Joyce Goldstein\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
