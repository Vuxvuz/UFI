Some recipes call for walnuts instead of almonds. Use what you like but be sure to toast the walnuts to enhance their rich, nutty flavor. Some recipes also call for yogurt. You can turn this into a wonderful dip for raw vegetables by adding some Greek yogurt.\n\nGreek Skordalia (Almond, Bread, and Garlic Sauce)\nRecipe courtesy of Joyce Goldstein\nServes 8\nIngredients:\n\n1 cup almonds, toasted\n½ cup whole wheat bread crumbs, fresh\n6 cloves garlic, minced\n½ teaspoon salt\n¼ cup red wine vinegar or 3 tablespoons lemon juice\n½ to ¾ cup extra virgin olive oil\nPreparation:\n\nCombine almonds, bread, garlic, and a little salt in the container of a food processor and pulse a few times.\nAdd vinegar and then oil a few drops at a time until the mixture is thick, creamy, and holds its shape when dropped from a spoon.\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/4 cup, or 1/8 of recipe250 calories4 grams of protein8 grams of carbohydrates2 grams of fiber160 milligrams of sodium24 grams of fat( 3 grams of saturated fat18 grams of monounsaturated fat3 grams of polyunsaturated fat)\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
