If you make your own vegetable stock, you can control the amount of salt you add to it. If you buy vegetable stock, compare brands to find the one with the least amount of sodium.\n\nMushroom Stroganoff\nRecipe courtesy of Joyce Goldstein\nCook Time 30 min.\nServes 4\nIngredients:\n\n4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n2 cups white onions, sliced\n1 tablespoon sweet paprika\n1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper or hot paprika\n1 teaspoon finely grated lemon peel\n1 pound mushrooms (either button, cremini, chanterelles, or a combination of these), sliced\n1 cup vegetable stock\n½ teaspoon kosher salt\n½ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper\n½ cup plain Greek yogurt mixed with 1 tablespoon flour\n2 tablespoons fresh dill, chopped\n2 tablespoons flat leaf parsley, chopped\nPreparation:\n\nHeat the oil in a large sauté pan and add the onions.
