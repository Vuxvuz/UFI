But truth be told, you can make hummus using any number of legumes. Lentils are a perfect example: grassy and earthier than chickpeas, they lend themselves nicely to this Levantine dip. Typically, chickpeas and other beans require long cooking times and even pre-soaking in baking soda to achieve a soft enough texture for hummus. But lentils cook to the perfect consistency in a flash, no kitchen hacks required, resulting in a super smooth hummus. We keep the flavors in our version classic: plenty of tahini, lemon, fresh garlic, and a dash of cumin. To dress up the dish, we pair our hummus with a simple, bright herb salad and plenty of assorted seeds. Tuck into this hummus with some pita or lavash—the perfect light dinner or party-pleasing appetizer.\n\nGreen Lentil Hummus with Herbs and Olives\nRecipe courtesy of Tim Chin\nServes 16 quarter-cup servings (recipe makes about 4 cups)\nIngredients:\n\n1 ¼ cups (8 ¾ ounces) green lentils, picked over and rinsed\n1 teaspoon plus 2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided\n8 cups water\n \n½ cup plus 2 teaspoons lemon juice (4 lemons), divided\n4 cloves garlic\n⅔ cup tahini\n¼ teaspoon cumin\n \n¾ cup fresh parsley, chopped coarse\n½ cup fresh dill sprigs, chopped coarse\n½ cup kalamata olives, pitted and sliced thin\n2 tablespoons plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided\n2 teaspoons lemon juice\nKosher salt\n2 tablespoons pepitas, toasted\n2 tablespoons unsalted sunflower seeds, toasted\nPreparation:\n\nBring lentils, 1 teaspoon salt, and water to boil in large saucepan over high heat, skimming off any foam that rises to surface.
