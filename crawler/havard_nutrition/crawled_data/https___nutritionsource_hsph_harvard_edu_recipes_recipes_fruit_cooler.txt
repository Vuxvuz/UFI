Fruit Cooler

Store-bought or café smoothies are marketed as “health” foods, but they are often loaded with sugar and high in calories—some have upwards of 300 calories in a 12-ounce serving. Try making a refreshing fresh fruit cooler instead. There’s no added sugar, and just a small amount of fruit, so this drink is only about 18 calories for each 12-ounce glass.

Fruit Cooler

Ingredients:

1/2 cup ice

Nutrition facts:
