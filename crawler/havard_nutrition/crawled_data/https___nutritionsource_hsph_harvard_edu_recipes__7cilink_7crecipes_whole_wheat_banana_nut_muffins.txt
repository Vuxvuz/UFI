Whole Wheat Banana Nut Muffins

These are 100 percent whole wheat muffins. The yogurt helps develop the delicate texture and the toasted walnuts combined with the walnut oil provide an appealing flavor and texture. If you don’t have walnut oil, just use all canola oil. You can enjoy these muffins warm or cool, but the banana flavor intensifies when the muffins cool to room temperature.
