Cook, stirring, for a few seconds to allow the spices to become fragrant and infuse the oil with flavor without burning.\nAdd the tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.\nPuree directly in the pot with an immersion blender. (If the sauce is not deep enough to fully immerse the blender and prevent splattering, carefully transfer the sauce to a deep bowl or jar to blend. Return to the pan after blending.)\nSimmer for 5 minutes more to slightly reduce the sauce. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Set aside. (This sauce can be made ahead and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks and reheated for quicker prep.)\nAssemble the casserole: In a 9‑inch square casserole dish, combine the quinoa, enchilada sauce, chile, beans, cilantro, cumin, chili powder, salt, pepper, and 3/4 cup of the cheese. Adjust the seasonings. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup cheese evenly over the top.\nBake until bubbling and the cheese has melted, about 15 minutes.\nServe immediately, garnished with the avocado and fresh tomato.\n\nRecipe from Always Delicious by David Ludwig, MD, PH & Chef Dawn Ludwig.
