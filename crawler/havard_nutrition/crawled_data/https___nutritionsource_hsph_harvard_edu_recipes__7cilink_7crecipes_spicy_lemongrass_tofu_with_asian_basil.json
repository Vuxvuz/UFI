Soy sauce is a concentrated source of sodium. Look for reduced sodium or “lite” versions, which contain 40 percent less sodium than traditional versions. Removing the added salt in this recipe will cut the amount of sodium per serving in half.\n\nSpicy Lemongrass Tofu with Asian Basil\nRecipe courtesy of Mai Pham\nServes 4\nIngredients:\n\n3 stalks lemongrass, finely chopped (about 5 tablespoons)\n1½ tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce\n2 teaspoons chopped Thai bird chilies\n1½ teaspoons ground turmeric\n2 teaspoons sugar\n12 ounces tofu, drained, cut into ¾-inch cubes\n3 tablespoons canola oil\n1 yellow onion, cut in half and thinly sliced lengthwise\n2 tablespoons minced shallots\n1 teaspoon minced garlic\n¼ teaspoon salt\n3 tablespoons roasted peanuts, chopped\n2/3 cup Asian basil leaves (cut large leaves in half)\nPreparation:\n\nPound the lemongrass and chilies with a mortar and pestle to pulverize them. Add soy sauce, turmeric, and sugar and mix well.\nIn a large glass bowl combine pounded aromatic mixture with the tofu and turn gently to coat evenly. Marinate for 30 minutes. (This will be a dry marinade, with not much liquid.)\nHeat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a small sauce pot over low heat. Add the onions, shallots, and garlic. Season with salt. Let cook covered 1 minute, add 1 tablespoon water, and continue to cook covered until the onions are translucent and soft—approximately 5 to 8 minutes. Set aside.\nHeat remaining oil in a large 12” non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Add the marinated tofu. (There should be enough room in the pan for all the tofu pieces to be in a single layer.) Shake pan slightly and let the tofu brown all over, using chopsticks or wooden spoons to turn the tofu pieces periodically so they cook evenly. Cook, uncovered, until tofu is nicely browned and caramelized.\nOnce the tofu is brown, add the onion mixture. Toss to warm and combine with the tofu. Adjust seasoning with a pinch of additional salt or sugar. Add half of the peanuts and Thai basil leaves. Remove from heat. Garnish with remaining peanuts and basil leaves and serve.\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/4 of recipe230 calories10 grams of protein12 grams of carbohydrates395 milligrams of sodium330 milligrams of potassium\nHEALTHY OILS\nWATER\nVEGETABLES\nFRUITS\nHEALTHY PROTEIN\nWHOLE GRAINS\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
