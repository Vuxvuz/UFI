Drying is an age-old preservation technique, increasing shelf life indefinitely. But drying also intensifies the flavor of mushrooms, driving off moisture and leaving precious glutamates intact. Rehydrating unlocks all of these flavors, and best of all, dried mushrooms become meatier than ever before. Here is our take on classic marinated shiitakes—one of the best ways to enjoy these fungi. After rehydrating the mushrooms, we slice them to increase surface area. Simmering the mushrooms in an intense mixture of soy sauce, wine, vinegar, and plenty of the reserved cooking liquid results in ultra-meaty gems of umami goodness. These mushrooms go well with anything, from soups to stews to salads and rice bowls. We serve ours simply, with fresh, crunchy cucumber and fragrant toasted sesame seeds. This dish is perfect with steamed rice as a light lunch, or as a side dish for a bigger feast. You can find dried shiitake mushrooms at any Asian grocery store, usually in bulk. \n\nMarinated Shiitake Mushroom and Cucumber Salad\nRecipe courtesy of Tim Chin\nServes 4-6\nIngredients:\n\nMushrooms\n4 cups (about 4 ounces) dried shiitake mushrooms\n1 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce\n3/4 cup sake or dry white wine\n1/4 cup white wine vinegar\n1/4 cup honey\n\n1 1-inch piece ginger, peeled\n\nSalad\n\n1 seedless English cucumber, sliced 1/4-inch thick\n1 tablespoon lemon juice, plus extra for serving\n1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds\nExtra-virgin olive oil\nPreparation:\n\nFor the Mushrooms: Bring 4 cups water to boil in large saucepan.
