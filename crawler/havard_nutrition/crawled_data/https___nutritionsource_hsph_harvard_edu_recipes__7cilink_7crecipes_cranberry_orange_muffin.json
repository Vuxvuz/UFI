(8 g) cornstarch\n¾ cup (64 g) almond flour\n⅓ cup (60 g) granulated sugar\n1½ tsp. (7 g) baking powder\n½ tsp. (2 g) salt\n1 egg yolk\n⅔ cup (130 g) canola oil\n1 Tbsp. (26 g) agave nectar (or honey)\n4 Tbsp. (60 g) buttermilk\n½ tsp. (4 g) vanilla extract\n½ cup (121 g) low fat (1%) Greek yogurt\n2 tsp. (8 g) orange zest\n2 egg whites\nPreparation:\n\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Line muffin tins with paper liners.\nPour boiling water over the dried cranberries and allow them to soak for 10 minutes.\nIn a medium mixing bowl, stir together all the dry ingredients.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer that is outfitted with a paddle attachment, place the egg yolk, oil, agave, buttermilk, vanilla, and yogurt and mix for two minutes until combined.\nAdd the dry ingredients in three stages, mixing on low speed and scraping the sides of the bowl with each addition.\nDrain the cranberries, discard the water, and add the cranberries to the batter along with the orange zest. Mix to combine.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk the egg white to medium peaks. Add a small amount of the egg whites to the batter and stir to combine (this will help lighten the batter a bit). Fold the remaining egg whites into the batter, carefully so as not to deflate the whites.\nScoop into muffin tins. Fill the tins three-quarters full. Bake 20 to 22 minutes.\n\nNutrition information per serving (1 muffin, or 1/18 of recipe):\n\n186 calories, 3 g protein, 19 g carbohydrate, 2 g fiber, 9 g sugar (5 g added sugar),90 mg sodium, 5 mg potassium, 9 g fat (1 g sat, 5.5 g mono, 2.5 g poly, 0 g trans), 10 mg cholesterol\n\nRecipe courtesy of The Culinary Institute of America\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
