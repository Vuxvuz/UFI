By making your own stock, you can control the amount of sodium and create an incredibly flavorful base for soups, stews, risottos, and other dishes that call for stock as the primary cooking liquid.\n\nRich Vegetable Stock\nRecipe courtesy of John Ash\nServes 16\nIngredients:\n\n8 cups sliced white onions\n4 cups diced carrots\n4 cups sliced leeks\n3 cups parsnips\n2 cups sliced celery stalks, including leafy tops\n¼ cup chopped garlic\n½ cup canola oil or extra virgin olive oil\n2 gallons (32 cups) water\n3 cups dry white wine\n1 ounce dry mushrooms\n4 cups chopped fresh tomatoes\n2 teaspoons whole black pepper corns\n6 bay leaves\n2 cups parsley leaves and stems, roughly chopped\n1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper\n1 teaspoon kosher or sea salt\nPreparation:\n\nIn a large pot add the onions, carrots, celery, leeks, parsnips, garlic, and olive or canola oil, and very lightly brown over moderate heat. Add remaining ingredients, bring to the boil, reduce heat and simmer partially covered for 1½ hours.\nCorrect seasoning with salt and pepper, strain, cool, and refrigerate or freeze. (You can use the strained vegetables as a base for a pureed vegetable soup. Simply place the strained vegetables and some of the stock in a blender. Blend until smooth, adding stock to get the desired consistency, heat and serve.)\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1 cup, or 1/16 of recipe100 calories2 grams of protein4 grams of carbohydrates1 grams of fiber190 milligrams of sodium560 milligrams of potassium\nHEALTHY OILS\nWATER\nVEGETABLES\nFRUITS\nHEALTHY PROTEIN\nWHOLE GRAINS\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
