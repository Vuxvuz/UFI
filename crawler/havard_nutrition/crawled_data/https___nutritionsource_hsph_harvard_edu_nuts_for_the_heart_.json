In reality, nuts are excellent sources of healthy fat, protein, and other healthful nutrients.\n\nOne surprising finding from nutrition research is that people who regularly eat nuts are less likely to have heart attacks or die from heart disease than those who rarely eat them. Several of the largest cohort studies, including the Adventist Study, the Iowa Women’s Health Study, the Nurses’ Health Study, and the Physicians’ Health Study have shown a consistent 30 percent to 50 percent lower risk of myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, or cardiovascular disease associated with eating nuts several times a week. In fact, the FDA now allows some nuts and foods made with them to carry this claim: “Eating a diet that includes one ounce of nuts daily can reduce your risk of heart disease.”\n\nThere are several ways that nuts could have such an effect. The unsaturated fats they contain help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol and raise HDL (good) cholesterol. One group of unsaturated fat found in walnuts, the omega-3 fatty acids, appears to prevent the development of erratic heart rhythms. Omega-3 fatty acids (which are also found in fatty fish such as salmon and bluefish) may also prevent blood clots, much as aspirin does.\n\nIn one large study examining nuts and health, researchers analyzed data from over 210,000 health professionals followed up to 32 years. They found that, compared with those who never or almost never ate nuts, people who ate one ounce of nuts five or more times per week had a 14% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and a 20% lower risk of coronary heart disease during the study period. [1] Both peanuts (technically a legume, but nutritionally similar to nuts) and walnuts were linked with lower disease risk.\n\nListen to a podcast on the study:\n\nSee Transcript\nAnother study found that nut consumption may help lower the risk of cardiovascular disease among people with type 2 diabetes (a condition associated with an increased risk for high cholesterol, heart disease, and stroke). Researchers found that those who ate five 28-gram servings of nuts per week had a 17% lower risk of cardiovascular disease, a 20% lower risk of coronary heart disease, a 34% lower risk of cardiovascular disease death, and a 31% reduced risk of all-cause premature death (compared to people who reported eating less than a single serving per month). [2]\nSince the study’s 16,217 participants were asked about nut consumption both before and after they were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, researchers also found that those who increased their intake after diagnosis had an 11% lower risk of cardiovascular disease, a 15% lower risk of coronary heart disease, a 25% lower risk of cardiovascular disease death, and a 27%  percent lower risk of all-cause premature death (compared with those who did not change their nut consumption after diagnosis).\n\nNuts are rich in arginine, an amino acid needed to make a molecule called nitric oxide that relaxes constricted blood vessels and eases blood flow. They also contain vitamin E, folate, potassium, fiber, and other healthful nutrients. Because different nuts supply a different mix of nutrients, it’s a good idea to incorporate a variety of nuts into a healthy eating plan.\n\nOf course, eating nuts won’t do much good if you gobble them in addition to usual snacks and meals. At an average of 185 calories per ounce, a handful of walnuts a day could add 10 pounds or more in a year if you don’t cut back on something else. This weight gain would tip the scales toward heart disease, not away from it. Instead, eat nuts instead of chips or other, less healthy snacks. Or try using them instead of meat in main dishes, or as a healthful crunch in salads.\n\nRelated\nFood Feature: Almonds\nReferences\nGuasch-Ferré M, Liu X, Malik VS, Sun Q, Willett WC, Manson JE, Rexrode KM, Li Y, Hu FB, Bhupathiraju SN.
