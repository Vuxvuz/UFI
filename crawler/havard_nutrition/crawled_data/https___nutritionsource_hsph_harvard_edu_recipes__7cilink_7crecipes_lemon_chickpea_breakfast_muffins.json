Using pureed, canned chickpeas creates a very moist, tender muffin because the chickpea starch holds water so well. The addition of ground almonds to the batter contributes a hearty nuttiness as well as healthy fats. Pair these muffins with fresh fruit and yogurt for the occasional breakfast, or grab a muffin and a cup of tea or coffee for an afternoon snack.\n\nLemon Chickpea Muffins\nServes 12 muffins, or 28 mini muffins\nIngredients:\n\nFor batter\n1¾ cup (271 g) chickpeas from a 15 oz. can, drained and rinsed\n1 Tbsp.
