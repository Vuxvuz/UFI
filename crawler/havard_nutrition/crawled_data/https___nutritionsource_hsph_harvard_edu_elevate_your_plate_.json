You may have also heard that producing dairy and red meat (particularly beef, lamb, and goat) stand out for their disproportionate impact on our planet’s health as well.\n\nIt’s clear that reducing red meat in our diets can improve our own health and the health of the planet. However, if you’ve grown up (or have grown accustomed to) having beef, pork, and other red meats on your plate at most meals—such a change may seem daunting. But you don’t have to completely cut it out to make a difference; even a partial shift away from a meat-centered diet can be a step in the right direction.\n\nIf you’re not quite sure where to start, here are four key approaches to cutting back the red meat while keeping your meals filling and flavorful.
