The umami flavor in certain foods comes from glutamic acid, an amino acid associated with savory or meaty flavors. Mushrooms contain a significant amount of glutamic acid and are considered an umami-rich food. Other umami-rich foods include tomatoes, aged cheeses like Parmeggiano Reggiano, and fermented foods like fish sauce and soy sauce. This recipe aggregates a number of umami-rich foods to create a savory, meat-free sandwich.\n\nPortabella Sandwiches with Umami Sauce\nRecipe courtesy of The Culinary Institute of America\nServes 4\nIngredients:\n\nFor umami sauce\n¼ cup mayonnaise\n1 ½ teaspoons reduced sodium or “lite” soy sauce\n½ teaspoon Dijon-style mustard\nFor caramelized onions\n1 medium white or yellow onion, sliced\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n½ teaspoon dried thyme\nFor portabella mushrooms\n4 large portabella mushroom caps, stems removed\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n3 teaspoons reduced sodium or “lite” soy sauce\n3 teaspoons balsamic vinegar\n4 whole grain rolls, toasted or warmed on the grill\nPreparation:\n\nPreheat your grill to medium-high.\nIn a small bowl combine the mayonnaise, soy sauce, and mustard.
