Mediterranean Rice
Mediterranean Rice
Recipe courtesy of Harvard University Dining Services
Cook Time 1 hr.
Serves 4
Ingredients:

1 cup brown rice, rinsed
2 cups water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon oregano, dried
1 medium tomato, diced
¼ cup feta cheese, crumbled
2 cups baby spinach, chopped
3 leaves fresh basil, julienne cut
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
Salt (optional) and pepper to taste
Preparation:

In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Add rice, stirring, and return to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer until all the water has been absorbed, about 40 minutes.
While the rice cooks, combine oil, garlic, and oregano in a separate bowl. Gently toss in tomatoes and feta cheese.
When rice is finished cooking, remove from heat and let rest for a minute. Fold tomato mixture, spinach, and basil into rice. Pour lemon juice over rice and mix again.
 Season with salt (if desired) and pepper to taste, and serve.
