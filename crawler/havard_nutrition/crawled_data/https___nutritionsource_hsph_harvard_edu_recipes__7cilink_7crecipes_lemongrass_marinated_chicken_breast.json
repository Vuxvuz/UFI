Remove chicken to a plate and season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Reserve the marinade to make a pan sauce with later.\nIn an oven-proof sauté pan over medium heat coated lightly with extra-virgin olive oil, sear the chicken, skin-side down, until browned. Flip chicken and finish in the oven.\nMeanwhile, make the couscous: Place couscous in large, heat-proof bowl. Pour boiling water over couscous, add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Stir quickly to blend and immediately cover bowl with plastic wrap, sealing tightly, and allow to steam until couscous is tender, about 5 minutes. Fluff couscous with the back of a fork.\nRemove chicken breasts from pan and let rest 5 minutes. Place pan back on stove and transfer remaining marinade to the pan and bring to a boil. Add olives and about 1 tablespoon olive oil, stir to combine and heat through.\nServe family-style by placing chicken breasts over couscous. Garnish by spooning pan sauce over chicken.\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/4 of recipe570 calories39 grams of protein58 grams of carbohydrates6 grams of fiber190 milligrams of sodium18 grams of fat( 4 grams of saturated fat11 grams of monounsaturated fat3 grams of polyunsaturated fat) 80 milligrams of cholesterol\nHEALTHY OILS\nWATER\nVEGETABLES\nFRUITS\nHEALTHY PROTEIN\nWHOLE GRAINS\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
