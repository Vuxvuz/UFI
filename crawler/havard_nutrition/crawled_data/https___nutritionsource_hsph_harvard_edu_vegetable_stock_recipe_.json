Cut the leeks into 1” pieces, put into a bowl of water and swish them around to clean. Let sit for 5 minutes, then lift the pieces out out (don’t pour them out) and place in a colander to drain.\nWash all of the vegetables and cut into 1” chunks. Onion and garlic skins can also be added, but don’t include the onion root.\nAdd all of the chopped vegetables and herbs to a large stock pot, and cover with cold water so that the vegetables are just submerged. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to low heat so that the pot is barely simmering. Simmer for 1 hour.\nAfter 1 hour, place a colander above another soup pot or dutch oven and strain the stock into the second pot. If you want to, line the colander with cheese cloth, or swap it for a fine-mesh strainer to get a clearer stock.\nYou can reduce the veggie stock further to concentrate the flavors, or just use it as-is.\n\nMore recipes to Prioritize Plants for Healthy Holiday Cooking\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
