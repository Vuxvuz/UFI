Traditional risotto requires carnaroli or arborio rice, but there are plenty of other grains you can use. Farro is the perfect example. It’s easy to cook, but doesn’t turn mushy as easily as traditional rice varieties. Here we pair whole, unhulled farro with our earthy Walnut Pesto. Cracking about half the farro in a blender is key to releasing enough starch from the grains to create a creamy, risotto-like texture. To keep the grains separate, we add liquid in stages. Stirring in the pesto at the very end of cooking ensures maximum freshness and maintains a vibrant green color in the dish.\n\nFarro Risotto with Walnut Pesto\nRecipe courtesy of Tim Chin\nServes 4\nIngredients:\n\n1 cup whole farro\n4 cups vegetable broth\n2 cups water\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 onion, minced\nSalt and pepper\n2 garlic cloves, minced\n1 cup dry white wine\n1 recipe Walnut Pesto\n⅓ cup basil leaves, torn into ½-inch pieces\nPreparation:\n\nPulse farro in blender until about half of grains are broken into smaller pieces, about 6 pulses.\nBring broth and water to boil in large saucepan over high heat; reduce heat to low and cover.\nMeanwhile, heat oil in large heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. \nStir in farro, increase the heat to medium, and cook, stirring often, until lightly toasted, about 4 minutes. Stir in the wine and continue to cook, stirring often, until the wine has been completely absorbed, about 2 minutes. \nStir in 2 cups broth mixture and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is absorbed and the bottom of the pan is dry, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in 2 more cups of the warm broth and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is absorbed and the bottom of the pan is dry, 15 to 20 ­minutes longer.\nContinue to cook risotto, stirring often and adding 1/2 cup remaining broth at a time as needed to keep pan bottom from becoming dry (about every 4 minutes), until grains are cooked through but still have bite, 15 to 20 minutes longer. Off heat, stir in 1/2 cup pesto. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with remaining 1/2 cup pesto and basil.\n\n \n\nNutrition facts:\n1 serving325 calories4 grams of protein4 grams of carbohydrates1 grams of fiber195 milligrams of sodium167 milligrams of potassium35 grams of fat( 5 grams of saturated fat21 grams of monounsaturated fat7 grams of polyunsaturated fat) 5 milligrams of cholesterol\nHEALTHY OILS\nWATER\nVEGETABLES\nFRUITS\nHEALTHY PROTEIN\nWHOLE GRAINS\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
