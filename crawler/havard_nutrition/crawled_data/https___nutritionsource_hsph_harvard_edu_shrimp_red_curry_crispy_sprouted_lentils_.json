Crisping them in a pan creates crunchy, toasty morsels that are something between popcorn, toasted nuts, and potato chips. Here we pair these crispy lentils with a simple but intense dish of poached shrimp in red curry. A splash of coconut milk rounds out the dish and gives body, and we serve the shrimp with plenty of fresh cilantro. Serve this dish with brown rice and plenty of limes for a light but satisfying dinner.  \n\nShrimp with Red Curry and Crispy Sprouted Lentils\nRecipe courtesy of Tim Chin\nServes 4\nIngredients:\n\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n1 cup sprouted lentils\n⅛ teaspoon salt, plus more to taste\n½ cup coconut milk\n1 tablespoon cornstarch\n4 cloves garlic, grated\n1 2-inch piece ginger, grated\n¼ cup (2 ounces) red curry paste\n⅓ cup vegetable broth\n1 ½ pounds fresh, shell-on jumbo shrimp (16 to 20 per pound), peeled, deveined, and tails removed\n12 fresh cilantro sprigs, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces\nPreparation:\n\nHeat 2 tablespoons oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering.
