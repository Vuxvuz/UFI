Aim for a variety of colors — variety is as important as quantity; no single fruit or vegetable provides all of the nutrients you need to be healthy.\nGrains – Trade in white rice for whole grains such as barley, bulgur, oat berries, quinoa, brown rice, and more. Try perusing your local grocery store’s bulk bins to discover new, delicious whole grains that are often simple to prepare.\nProtein – Rely on healthy protein such as fresh fish, chicken or turkey, tofu, eggs, and a variety of beans and nuts.\nHealthy fats and oils – Use liquid vegetable oils whenever possible for sautéing vegetables, stir-frying fish or chicken, and as the base of salad dressings. Good choices include canola, sunflower, corn, soybean, peanut, and olive oil.\nOther essentials – Even a small amount of a high-quality ingredient can have a big impact on flavor. Stock your kitchen with high-quality basics like extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, fresh and dried herbs, and a variety of unsalted nuts (such as walnuts, almonds, and pistachios), and you’ll have flavorful building blocks for any recipe.\nFeatured Recipes\nGreen Lentil Hummus with Herbs and Olives\nTuck into this hummus with some pita or lavash—the perfect crowd-pleasing snack.\nEndlessly
