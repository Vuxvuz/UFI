Add your own favorite blend of spices and toss some chickpeas in a salad, or grab a handful for a healthy snack.\n\nIngredients\nOne 15-oz can chickpeas (garbanzo beans)\n1 Tablespoon olive oil\n1 teaspoon spice or spice blend of choice (more/less to taste)\nTry dried spices like chili powder, cumin, curry powder, cayenne, cinnamon, or fresh herbs such as thyme, rosemary, oregano.\nInstructions\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F.\nStrain the chickpeas and rinse well, draining as much water as possible. Lay the chickpeas on a paper towel or dish cloth, and pat dry to absorb the water. For crispier chickpeas, roll the towel over the beans to remove the thin skins (this step is optional but it will further eliminate moisture when baking).\nOnce fully dry, line a baking sheet and place the chickpeas in the oven to roast for 15 minutes (avoid crowding the baking sheet, especially if doubling the recipe).\nRemove chickpeas from the oven and drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle over the spices, making sure they are evenly coated. Place them back into the oven and roast for another 15 minutes (you may need more or less time, just keep an eye on them so they don’t burn).\nWhen done, turn off the oven and keep its door slightly open as it cools down. Note that the chickpeas will be crunchiest following roasting, but can be stored for a few days at room temperature.\n\nHEALTHY OILS\nWATER\nVEGETABLES\nFRUITS\nHEALTHY PROTEIN\nWHOLE GRAINS\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
