Cover and simmer until rice is tender and all the water is absorbed, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. Warm 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a sauté pan over medium heat. Stir in cabbage, red pepper, ginger, and garlic, sautéing until peppers are tender and cabbage is just wilted. Combine the cabbage mixture with the cooked rice; add scallions, soy sauce, and sesame oil, and season with salt and pepper.\nAdd one egg white (or 2 tablespoons of packaged egg whites) and 1 tablespoon flour, and mix. Test the mixture, adding flour until you can form a small ball that stays together. If the mixture gets too dry, add a small amount of skim milk or egg white to loosen it (begin with 1 tablespoon of either skim milk or egg white).\nDrop 2-ounce balls onto a hot dry griddle and flatten gently with your palm (if the mixture sticks to your palms, you can dip your hand in water). Grill each side until the pancake is firm, about 2 minutes per side.\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/12 of recipe (1 pancake)90 calories3 grams of protein15 grams of carbohydrates1 grams of fiber75 milligrams of sodium2 grams of fat\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
