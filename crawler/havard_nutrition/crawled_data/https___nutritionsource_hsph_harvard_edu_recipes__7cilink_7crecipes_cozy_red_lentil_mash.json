One of the beautiful things about red lentils (which are actually orange, but cook up to be yellow, so the name is confusing) is that they inadvertently mash themselves. Very thoughtful of them to pitch in.\n\nSimmer the lentils well ahead of time. This will take about 20 to 30 minutes. While they are simmering, start cooking the onions. The onions need to be very well done in order for this dish to achieve its highest potential.\n\nYou have the option of “spiking” the olive oil with butter, which will give the dish a richer, more complex flavor. This is also perfectly fine without the butter—something vegans will be glad to know.\n\nCozy Red Lentil Mash\nRecipe courtesy of Mollie Katzen/Harvard University Dining Services\nServes 4 as a main dish, or 6 as a side dish\nIngredients:\n\n1-2 tablespoons olive oil (use the lesser amount if adding butter)\n2 teaspoons unsalted butter (optional)\n3 cups minced sweet onion\n2 cups uncooked red lentils\n5 cups water\n1 teaspoon salt\n2-3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar\nBlack pepper, to taste\nCayenne (if desired)\nPreparation:\n\nPlace a large, wide skillet over medium heat and wait 1 minute. Add the olive oil and swirl to coat the pan. Add the butter, if using, and let it melt into the olive oil. Then add the onions, shaking the pan to make sure they are distributed over the heated oil. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, and adding ½ teaspoon salt any time after the first 5 minutes or so.\nMeanwhile, combine the lentils and water in an uncovered pot or kettle. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to a simmer, and let it cook undisturbed over the lowest possible heat until all the lentils are soft (approximately 10 to 30 minutes). To insure against burning the bottom, you can insert a heat-absorber underneath.\nAfter the onions have cooked for about 30 minutes, douse them with 2 tablespoons of the vinegar, mixing it in as you go. When the onions are very soft, and very sweet (about a few minutes later), add the lentils, stirring them in to combine well.\nRemove from the heat, and taste to adjust salt (it will need more) and vinegar (I usually end up adding another tablespoon or so).\nSeason with black pepper and cayenne, and serve hot, warm, or at room temperature. This stores well in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator, and reheats beautifully in the microwave.\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/4 of recipe450 calories27 grams of protein66 grams of carbohydrates15 grams of fiber610 milligrams of sodium6 grams of fat( 2 grams of saturated fat4 grams of monounsaturated fat) 5 milligrams of cholesterol\nHEALTHY OILS\nWATER\nVEGETABLES\nFRUITS\nHEALTHY PROTEIN\nWHOLE GRAINS\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
