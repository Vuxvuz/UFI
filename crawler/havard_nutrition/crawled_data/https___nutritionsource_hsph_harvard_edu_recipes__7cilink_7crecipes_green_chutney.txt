Green Chutney

Green chutney is a classic condiment made by nearly every family in northern India where it is served with just about every meal. Made with mint, cilantro, and green mango, this recipe is easy to alter—you can make it solely with cilantro, you can increase the amount of chiles to make it super hot, or you can make the mint stand out by increasing its proportion in relation to the cilantro (do use some cilantro or the chutney will taste bitter). It’s especially good with grilled seafood or vegetables.

Green Chutney
Recipe courtesy of Suvir Saran
Serves Makes 1 1/2 cups, or 12 servings
Ingredients:

1 cup cilantro leaves and stems, chopped
1 cup mint leaves
1 green, unripe mango, peeled, fruit sliced away from the pit, and roughly chopped
2–3 jalapeno peppers, seeded and deveined if you prefer a milder flavor
1 2-inch long piece of ginger root, peeled and sliced
½ small red onion, peeled
Juice from 1 lemon
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 teaspoon kosher salt
½ cup water

Place all of the ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth, scraping down the sides of the blender as needed. If the chutney doesn’t blend easily, add a little water to facilitate the process—keep in mind this will make the chutney milder.
