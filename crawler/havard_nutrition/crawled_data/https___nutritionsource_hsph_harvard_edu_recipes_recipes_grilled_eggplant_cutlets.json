The firmness of eggplant holds up well to being grilled–and makes a great base for a juicy, ripe tomato.\n\nGrilled Eggplant Cutlets\nRecipe courtesy of Harvard University Dining Services\nServes 6\nIngredients:\n\n1 large eggplant or 2 medium ones\n2 large tomatoes\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n¼ cup grated parmesan cheese\n1 teaspoon oregano\nSalt and pepper\nPreparation:\n\nHeat the grill. Slice eggplant into rounds about ¾ inch thick. Slice tomatoes into rounds about ¼ inch thick. Lay all the rounds flat and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Stir oregano into the olive oil in a small separate bowl, and brush mixture lightly onto the eggplant and tomato rounds.\nGrill eggplant and tomato rounds, olive oil side down, tomato slices for about 1 minute each, and eggplant slices for about 2 minutes each. Remove from the grill and flip so that the oiled sides are up.\nHeat the broiler. Lay out eggplant slices on a baking sheet. Top each slice with a slice of tomato. Sprinkle the eggplant-tomato stacks with parmesan cheese and broil until cheese is bubbly, about two minutes.\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/4 of recipe90 calories3 grams of protein8 grams of carbohydrates4 grams of fiber85 milligrams of sodium5 milligrams of cholesterol\nHEALTHY OILS\nWATER\nVEGETABLES\nFRUITS\nHEALTHY PROTEIN\nWHOLE GRAINS\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
