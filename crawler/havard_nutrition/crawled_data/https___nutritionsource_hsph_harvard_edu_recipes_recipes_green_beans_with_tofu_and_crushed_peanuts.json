Cut tofu into 1-inch pieces and toss gently with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Spread the oil-coated tofu in a single layer on a baking sheet and roast in the oven until lightly browned, approximately 15 minutes. Turn with a spatula half-way through to ensure equal browning. When done, remove from the oven and set aside.\nMeanwhile, steam the green beans in a medium-size pan on the stove top until tender but slightly crispy, then shock immediately in cold water. Drain and set aside.\nWarm 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a sauté pan. Once heated, add the garlic and ginger, stirring to mix them together. Cook until mixture is tender, but do not burn the garlic. Add zest and chili flakes and stir again; cook for about 1 minute. Add green beans and toss to cover with garlic and ginger. Add in the tofu pieces, tossing the mixture again.\nSplash with lemon juice, toss again, taste, and season. Remove to warm serving platter and sprinkle the top with crushed peanuts.\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/4 of recipe220 calories11 grams of protein13 grams of carbohydrates5 grams of fiber10 milligrams of sodium14 grams of fat( 2 grams of saturated fat8 grams of monounsaturated fat4 grams of polyunsaturated fat)\nHEALTHY OILS\nWATER\nVEGETABLES\nFRUITS\nHEALTHY PROTEIN\nWHOLE GRAINS\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
