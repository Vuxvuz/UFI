Green Beans with Dried Cherries
Green Beans with Dried Cherries
Recipe courtesy of Harvard University Dining Services
Cook Time 20 min.
Serves 4
Ingredients:

½ cup dried sweetened cherries
½ tablespoon canola oil
½ small red onion, diced (scant ¼ cup)
2 tablespoons firmly packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
¼ cup water
1 pound green beans, trimmed
Salt to taste (optional)
Preparation:

Begin by making the cherry glaze: Heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the red onion and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until tender.
Add the brown sugar to the onions. Stir to dissolve.
Add the dry cherries, vinegar, and water. Simmer mixture for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the cherries are soft and the liquid has reduced. Do not let the mixture cook until dry; if it begins to dry out, add more water in small amounts to keep it moist. Set the sauce aside.
Place the beans in a small steamer basket, and place the basket in a pot with a tightly fitting lid, above an inch of boiling water. Cover and cook over medium-high heat for about 3 minutes, keeping the beans slightly crisp.
Toss the steamed green beans with the cherry glaze, season with salt to taste (if desired), and serve.
