Spicy Coconut Rice with Limes
Spicy Coconut Rice with Limes
Recipe courtesy of Harvard University Dining Services
Cook Time 1 hr.
Serves 4
Ingredients:

1 cup brown basmati rice
1 cup low-fat coconut milk
1 cup water
1 tablespoon canola oil
½ cup minced onions
½ seeded and minced jalapeno pepper*
1 teaspoon minced ginger
Juice and zest from 1 lime

Cooking notes*

You can use the entire jalapeno pepper if desired, but the final dish will be hot. For mild heat, remove the seeds; for more heat, include the seeds.
Be careful when cutting hot peppers, as the acid can burn the skin. Wear gloves when handling hot peppers, or wash your hands thoroughly afterward. Be especially careful not to touch your eyes or lips with bare or gloved hands that have handled hot peppers.
Preparation:

In a medium saucepan, whisk together the rice, water, and coconut milk. Bring to a boil over high heat.
Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 50 minutes or until fluffy and all the liquid is absorbed.
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a sauté pan over medium heat and sauté onions and jalapeno pepper until translucent and tender; do not burn. Remove from heat.
When rice is finished cooking, add ginger, sautéed onions and peppers, lime zest, and lime juice, stir to combine, and serve.
