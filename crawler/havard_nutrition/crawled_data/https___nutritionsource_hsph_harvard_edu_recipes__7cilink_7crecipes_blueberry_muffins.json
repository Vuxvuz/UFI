The muffins from this recipe weigh about 2 ounces, contain 120 calories, and are made with a mixture of whole wheat, white, and almond flour. (You don’t need to buy almond flour; you can make your own almond flour by grinding whole almonds in your food processor.) All of the butter was replaced with canola oil. And the amount of fresh blueberries was doubled. Orange zest adds a zingy background note that contrasts nicely with the sweetness of the blueberries. The result is a moist, flavorful blueberry muffin that will provide longer lasting energy compared to the usual coffee shop muffin.\n\nBlueberry Muffins\nServes 18 muffins or 30 mini muffins\nIngredients:\n\n1 cup (120 g) whole wheat pastry flour\n¾ cup (90 g) white whole wheat flour\n¼ cup (26 g) almond flour\n1 tsp. (4 g) baking powder\n½ tsp. (4 g) baking soda\n½ tsp. (2 g) salt\n1 tsp. (2 g) orange zest\n1 ½ cups (200 g) fresh blueberries\n2 eggs\n1¼ cups (286 g) low fat (1%) buttermilk\n4 Tbsp. (42 g) brown sugar\n6 Tbsp. (78 g) canola oil\n1 Tbsp. (14 g) orange juice, freshly squeezed\n½ tsp. (4 g) vanilla\nPreparation:\n\nPlace the rack in the top third of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit Line muffin tins with paper liners.\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine the flours, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and orange zest. Add the fresh blue berries and toss gently to coat the blueberries in flour. This will help keep the blueberries suspended in the batter versus falling to the bottom.\nIn a medium mixing bowl, lightly beat the eggs, then whisk in the buttermilk, brown sugar, canola oil, orange juice, and vanilla. Don’t be concerned if the mixture looks curdled or lumpy.\nPour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until most of the flour is incorporated. The mixture can be slightly lumpy; don’t over mix. Divide the batter among the 18 prepared muffin cups.\nBake 12 to 14 minutes, until the muffins are golden brown around the edges.\n\nNutrition information per serving (1 muffin, or 1/18 of recipe):\n\n120 calories, 3 g protein, 14 g carbohydrate, 2 g fiber, 5 g sugar (2 g added sugar), 125 mg sodium, 20 mg potassium, 5 g fat (0.5 g sat, 3 g mono, 1.5 g poly, 0 g trans), 20 mg cholesterol\n\nRecipe courtesy of The Culinary Institute of America\n\nRelated\nThe Great Muffin Makeover\nBlueberry Muffin Battle\nHarvard Chan Cooks: recipe videos\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
