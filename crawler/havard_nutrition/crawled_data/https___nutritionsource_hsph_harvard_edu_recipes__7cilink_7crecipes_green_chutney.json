Made with mint, cilantro, and green mango, this recipe is easy to alter—you can make it solely with cilantro, you can increase the amount of chiles to make it super hot, or you can make the mint stand out by increasing its proportion in relation to the cilantro (do use some cilantro or the chutney will taste bitter). It’s especially good with grilled seafood or vegetables.\n\nGreen Chutney\nRecipe courtesy of Suvir Saran\nServes Makes 1 1/2 cups, or 12 servings\nIngredients:\n\n1 cup cilantro leaves and stems, chopped\n1 cup mint leaves\n1 green, unripe mango, peeled, fruit sliced away from the pit, and roughly chopped\n2–3 jalapeno peppers, seeded and deveined if you prefer a milder flavor\n1 2-inch long piece of ginger root, peeled and sliced\n½ small red onion, peeled\nJuice from 1 lemon\n1 tablespoon granulated sugar\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n½ cup water\nPreparation:\n\nPlace all of the ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth, scraping down the sides of the blender as needed.
