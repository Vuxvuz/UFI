The dressing for this salad also works well on salads made with mild flavored baby greens, like baby spinach.\n\nCitrus Salad with Ginger Lime Dressing\nRecipe courtesy of Amy Myrdal Miller\nServes 4\nIngredients:\n\nFor dressing\nJuice from 1 lemon (about 3 tablespoons)\n2 tablespoons canola oil\n1 teaspoon finely grated fresh ginger root, peeled before grating\n2 tablespoons granulated sugar\nZest from 1 lime (about 1 teaspoon very finely grated peel)\n1/8 teaspoon salt\nFor salad\n3 Cara Cara oranges, cut into segments\n2 navel oranges, cut into segments\n1 pink grapefruit, cut into segments\n¼ cup chopped mint leaves\nPreparation:\n\nCombine all ingredients for the dressing in a small mixing bowl and whisk well.\nTo make beautiful Cara Cara segments, use a sharp knife to cut the top (stem side) and bottom off the fruit. Set the fruit on its bottom and use your knife to cut away the rest of the peel, working from the top to bottom and rotating the fruit as you go until all of the peel has been removed. You want to remove all of the white pith as well. Cut out the segments, leaving behind the membrane that separates the segments. Place the segments in a medium mixing bowl.\nDrain off any juice from the segments, and then add the mint and dressing. Use a spoon to mix gently. Serve immediately.\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/4 of recipe175 calories2 grams of protein30 grams of carbohydrates4 grams of fiber75 milligrams of sodium325 milligrams of potassium5 milligrams of cholesterol\n\nCreate healthy, balanced meals using this visual guide as a blueprint.\n\nSupport The Nutrition Source\n\nThank you for supporting our mission of translating food and nutrition knowledge into daily practice!\nMAKE A GIFT\n\n \n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nA monthly update filled with nutrition news and tips from Harvard experts—all designed to help you eat healthier.\nSIGN UP\n\nHarvard Chan Home Harvard University Home Make a Gift Privacy Policy Report Copyright Violation Accessibility\nCopyright © 2025 The President and Fellows of Harvard College\nTerms of Use\nThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
